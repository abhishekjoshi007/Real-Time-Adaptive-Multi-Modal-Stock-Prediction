As for reinvesting, I would suggest you read the books first. Considering you held the stocks since 2020, spce and atomera both spiked twice, once in 2021 and once in 2022. By my calculation, your average price on atomera is about 17.86, assuming its the one with the 87 loss. For the most of 2021 and 2022, its price was above that price. The shares even hit 47 and 33.

Then people give free info on quality options to do that and they laugh in their face about fundamentals and bag holding just to go back and lose more money playing options on the Mag 7. Everyone wants to buy a stock in single digits and hold until they are millionairs, but the majority dont have the balls or brains to do it. I appreciate the post. I have 2000 shares of ASTS at 10 that I plan on holding for the next 10 plus years if they stay on their current trajectory. I have added your other stocks to my watch list and will most likely be taking a position in both in the near future. Thanks."

Smr. Not much different than the others, doubled since September. I mean none of these are at good buy points. Even if youre going to play story time, let them prove themselves.

On top of that it works perfectly with solar fields and wind power fields to store the electric energy as hydrogen if theres an excess of supply.

Both are operated by Sinomine Chinese owned. The mine in Manitoba has a short mine life ahead of it. To lengthen the mine life of the Tanco mine, Sinomine is currently asking to drain the lake above it so they can chase the ore closer to the surface. I could very well see this new project being pushed forward as an act of globalnational security. Mining is a very slow and expensive process though, so its always a risky play. Always a chance this producer gets close to money, then bankrupts itself and goes into production under a different name."
