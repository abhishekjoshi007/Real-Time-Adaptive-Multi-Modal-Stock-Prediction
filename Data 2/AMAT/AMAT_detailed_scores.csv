Reddit,2024-08-16,"Ive been trading OXY since last fall. Buffett likes them and holds 255 million shares. Hes been buying more recently when the price has been in the high 50s. Buffett also has a huge cash pile, so it stands to reason that Buffett will continue to buy more shares if the price drops. That should help create a floor. Today I sold the 57 put with the 823 expiration date. I got 0.37 in premium and the trade lasts one week. So I divide the 0.37 in premium by the 57 strike and I get 0.0065. Then I multiply that by 52, because Im risking the money for one week, and I could do a trade similar to this on this or another company 52 times over the course of a year. And I get an annualized return of 33. Im doing this with one tranche of what Im willing to put into OXY, and I already have three tranches of OXY with a total cost basis of 52.74 per share. This put option reduces my cost basis down to 52.62 per share. If I get assigned the shares at 57 Ill collect the dividend on 910, then sell a covered call at the 57 strike. Heres an example",Neutral,0,0.999579131603241,Reply

I do this on both SPY and TLT. Right now that equates to selling the 540510 put spread on SPY and 9690 put spread on TLT. But what I cant figure out how to do is sell calls consistently for a profit.

Reddit,2024-09-04,"Id disagree with Nvidia clients cash not covering their price to sales. Nvidia has a backlog big enough to cover the growth for the next 12 years that the market priced in. They cant sell their chips fast enough is the bigger problem than their top4, lowdebt, 300bln combined net income clients not having enough cash to buy them. Nvidia clients literally wait up to 12 months to receive the cards they signed a contract for the purchase of. Current Nvidia prices needs only 135140bln 125bln consensus estimate 10 in revenue next year. Their gaming secures 30bln, so they need 100110 in enterprise servers chips sales. MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOGL capex combined abt 170bln can easily cover that, and they have hundreds of other customers. They also easily cover the growth of revenue to 280 bln in 2028, since their current free cash flow exceeds 240 bln despite of current 170bln in capex and shows no signs of dropping.

Yahoo,2024-09-07,"Here is a rundown of policy differences. This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like AMAT to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax AMAT would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of AMAT stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on AMAT stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on AMAT stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal.",Neutral,0,0.9919661283493042,Main
