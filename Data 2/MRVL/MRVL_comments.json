I could be wrong about how well they are doing, but puts are my gut reaction. edit also their security or store procedures suck dick. some old lady was able to buy a pair of shoes using my card. and I had to track her down and have kohls investigate etc. and It was probably just some dumb employee that looked up the wrong name in store and charged it to my card because Sears used to have that issue also."

There is a metric to options, several actually, but one in particular called implied volatility IV for short. Iv plays a factor into options price, and iv is driven by expected events that would drive market price. Earnings is a big one, dates of known contract announcements or company announcements. The market knows all of this and tracks it through IV. The closer you get to these events, the IV will rise, causing the price of an option to rise with it. So by buying options for known events as far away from them as you can stomach, the cheaper you can get that same option for. You have to balance that with how much you think the price will change before that event though. Options are simple yet complicated. So if you buy an option today for earnings tomorrow, it will likely be as expensive as that option gets. Starting the moment the event happens, the iv begins to drop dramatically, lowering the price of the option. This is known as iv crush if you have heard that term used."

But if you look at QoQ, QoQ revenue growth rate has been slowing QoQ revenue growth was 15, which is a lowering percentage that previous QoQ growths not Nvidias fault... its just that the law of large numbers is a bitch. Now that we got that out of the way. Heres some issues Their current margins are about as good as they can get... they can likely only get slightly better by a hair going forward, but there is more room for the downside to get substantially worse. Cyclicality. Any company that sells hardware, where a small concentrated customer base accounts for a large portion of their earnings, is prone to cyclical boom and busts. If Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla decide to not increase their spending on AI GPUs that much more from here or cut back on it, then RIP Nvidia. Following the previous point, why would they possibly not increase their spending that much more or even cut it? Because for the 100200 billion or so being spent on this crap, very little money is being made. OpenAI only made like 3 Billion in annual revenue.

They previously agreed on a 25% with their union leadership which was voted down by more than 96% of their union members.  Boeing then renegotiated and offered 30% over 4 years with added bonus and increase in 401 k matching (which they made public).  This publication cause a rift between the Union leadership and Boeing because they felt “disrespected” and so the strike continues.  Boeing called theirs offer “best and final”.  So they agreed to meet today.  What do y’all think Boeing should do?  Some think Boeing should increase their offer to appease the union, but In think they should not.  I think once you are an organization of Boeing’s caliber you should not go back on your words.  Basically, Boeing has a conundrum: they want to end the strike without going back on their words.  \nSo, there is a way out IMHO.  Boeing and their machinists could agree on their “best and final” offer and reserve the right to renegotiate the contract in 2 years.  The reasons are: Boeing has been losing money since 2018 and are reeling from one debacle after another.  This way the union workers can have their raises, Boeing gets to keep their dignity, and they can build a better future together.\nWhat do y’all think?"

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects MRVL) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of MRVL to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

The same will begin to happen in China after a Harris and Walz win.An attack on Taiwan will send the California economy into a tailspin. Majority of the world&#39;s chips are designed in California and then manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC. The US and world economy will follow.This is a real possibility and preparations have been made. The recent China-Russia partnership is stategic. The Chinese will sell their manufacted products into Russia and Russia will sell China energy (oil and gas) to compensate for the heavy sanctions that are very likely to occur after an attack on Taiwan. How does one trade this possibility?"

So, a MRVL investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects MRVL the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for MRVL. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like MRVL to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax MRVL would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of MRVL stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on MRVL stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on MRVL stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."
