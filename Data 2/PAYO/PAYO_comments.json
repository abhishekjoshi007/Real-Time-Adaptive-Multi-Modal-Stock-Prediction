The most obvious potential factor is if theres a regime change and Trump wins and then makes major policy changes that have some form of economic impact at home or abroad. But aside from that, Israel is getting out of hand and may cause this localized conflict to become a bigger regional problem. The Arab governments are already unstable and their inaction against Israel has their citizens ready to riot. I was just in Turkey and there is constant discussions on the news, in the streets and in Taxis about the need for Turkeys military to join Iran and intervene.

I just feel like the covid responsemoney printer broke the economy more than weve allowed ourselves to feel, so far. I think Powells doing a good job, but we printed a ton of money, and the government seems intent to continue spending more than they should. His job is damn near impossible, especially in an election cycle with two change candidates in the running. Ill be forever impressed if we avoid a recession.

                    "text": "Many Fed officials are kinda panicking, while trying hard to not look like it. Powell took the risk of starting the cutting cycle with 50 basis point, and probably tried really hard to convince multiple Fed officials to go along with the 50 bps cut I think Barkin, Waller, Schmid, Logan, Musalem, Bostic wouldve all preferred starting with 25 bps and 75bps total in 2024. 7 people wanted 75 bps total in 2024 and 2 wanted 50 bps cut total in 2024. So to start with 50 bps cut and only cut 25 bps in 1 out of 2 remaining meetings, just gives off an inconsistentbizarre message instead of 25 bps in each of the 3 remaining meetings. Even if the economy is fine, doing so really risks the financial market taking it the wrong way and thinking the Fed is worried about recession. So if market thinks so and sell off, that would kill consumer sentiments, and would lead to an actual recession. So thats the big risk. Theres really no huge benefit to 50 bps cut other than if the Fed needs to cut 75bps in the next meeting to react to a recession, they are in a better position to do so. If they cut 25 basis point in Sept and gave a really dovish speech, even saying theyll cut 50 bps in Nov, the market wouldve priced in more Fed cuts, and the net effect on financial condition wouldve been pretty similar. So I wasnt sure why they did the 50 bps cut for minimal benefits and huge tail risk. Its even more bizarre they made that decision during the blackout no communication period, which further gives the impression theyre panicking. As you can see below, were at the same restrictiveness as where we were in summer 2022 when Fed fund rate was around 2, and the loosening happened in May 2024, months ago. Of course lower inflation gave the Fed reason to cut 50 bps. But doing so 1.5 months early makes little difference, and they took huge risk of the market misinterpreting the message. So I dont know why they did that, if they werent actually concerned themselves. Maybe their local business contacts have been telling them negative things."
