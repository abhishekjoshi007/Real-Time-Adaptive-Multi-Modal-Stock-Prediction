Reddit,2024-10-06,Lowest Fed rate for 2025,Neutral,0,0.9968057870864868,Main
Reddit,2024-10-06,I think the neutral interest rate is somewhere around 4. I expect a series of 25 basis point cuts with a target of 3.75 to 4.25 by the end of 2025.,Neutral,0,0.9994513392448425,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-06,"Barring a major economic recession, its unlikely to go below about 4 I would say. The Fed was pretty aggressive with the last rate cut, but I see them going back to form with minor adjustments depending on how things are shaking. Even in a relatively medium grade recession, I doubt less than 23. It will only go below that if the economy blows up for some reason.",Negative,-1,0.9520670771598816,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-06,"Im expecting the economy to have a tough time, post election. From here to end of 2025, Im completely guessing at a 175bp reduction.

Reddit,2024-10-06,"Median 3.5, lower bound 3, if anything goes wrong though. Unemployment really begins to ramp up, the stock market is off north of 10, unexpected events, thats how you get the Fed rate into the 2s. If youre looking to strategize interest rates, the easy trade is being short atm puts on rate products that expire, maybe January 2026. While I think we probably have 6x 25 point cuts between right now and the end of next year, this strategy doesnt really require that to play out. You just need things to not get worse from an inflationary perspective As long as you watch your deltas and overall exposure You have a pretty straightforward trade on your hands",Neutral,0,0.9544055461883545,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-06,I think we get 100 bps cuts this year and then another 150 next year. 3.5 seems like a good place for the Fed to go down to and then pause while they wait to see the effects from the cuts.,Positive,1,0.9570246338844299,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-06,"Its hard to see the Fed cutting rates below 3 in 2025, given the current economic factors you mentioned. With unemployment stabilizing and oil prices uncertain, along with the potential for inflationary pressure from geopolitical issues, the Fed might be cautious about making deep rate cuts. This environment could favor companies that benefit from higher rates, like payment systems e.g., PAYO, WISE.LSE. On the other hand, some retail construction companies with strong fundamentals, like LEN and MHO, might still be attractive investments even if rates stay elevated.",Negative,-1,0.9967246651649475,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-06,"I dont see much reason for any major change. We might see .25 or .5 drop from here. But things are pretty stable right now and it will be tough for the fed to make the case for a major change UNLESS some outside factor happens, which is totally possible. The most obvious potential factor is if theres a regime change and Trump wins and then makes major policy changes that have some form of economic impact at home or abroad. But aside from that, Israel is getting out of hand and may cause this localized conflict to become a bigger regional problem. The Arab governments are already unstable and their inaction against Israel has their citizens ready to riot. I was just in Turkey and there is constant discussions on the news, in the streets and in Taxis about the need for Turkeys military to join Iran and intervene.

Reddit,2024-10-06,"A large number of people are reportedly financially hurting right now. Our recent economic numbers have looked good, but they dont reflect how the average consumer has felt lately. Then, those economic numbers are often revised lower than initially reported, well after the fact. I dont think Ill ever short a stock in my life, its not my thing. And Im not going to stop buying at any point in the next 30 years or so. Im not any kind of bear. I just feel like the covid responsemoney printer broke the economy more than weve allowed ourselves to feel, so far. I think Powells doing a good job, but we printed a ton of money, and the government seems intent to continue spending more than they should. His job is damn near impossible, especially in an election cycle with two change candidates in the running. Ill be forever impressed if we avoid a recession. I just dont think were going to avoid one. It wont be the end of the world",Negative,-1,0.652320384979248,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-06,"Many Fed officials are kinda panicking, while trying hard to not look like it. Powell took the risk of starting the cutting cycle with 50 basis point, and probably tried really hard to convince multiple Fed officials to go along with the 50 bps cut I think Barkin, Waller, Schmid, Logan, Musalem, Bostic wouldve all preferred starting with 25 bps and 75bps total in 2024. 7 people wanted 75 bps total in 2024 and 2 wanted 50 bps cut total in 2024. So to start with 50 bps cut and only cut 25 bps in 1 out of 2 remaining meetings, just gives off an inconsistentbizarre message instead of 25 bps in each of the 3 remaining meetings. Even if the economy is fine, doing so really risks the financial market taking it the wrong way and thinking the Fed is worried about recession. So if market thinks so and sell off, that would kill consumer sentiments, and would lead to an actual recession. So thats the big risk. Theres really no huge benefit to 50 bps cut other than if the Fed needs to cut 75bps in the next meeting to react to a recession, they are in a better position to do so. If they cut 25 basis point in Sept and gave a really dovish speech, even saying theyll cut 50 bps in Nov, the market wouldve priced in more Fed cuts, and the net effect on financial condition wouldve been pretty similar. So I wasnt sure why they did the 50 bps cut for minimal benefits and huge tail risk. Its even more bizarre they made that decision during the blackout no communication period, which further gives the impression theyre panicking. As you can see below, were at the same restrictiveness as where we were in summer 2022 when Fed fund rate was around 2, and the loosening happened in May 2024, months ago. Of course lower inflation gave the Fed reason to cut 50 bps. But doing so 1.5 months early makes little difference, and they took huge risk of the market misinterpreting the message. So I dont know why they did that, if they werent actually concerned themselves. Maybe their local business contacts have been telling them negative things.",Neutral,0,0.9179418683052063,Reply
