Instead we extract and export more than ever, and this All Of Above, has meant more and more climate change for the big picture/world.   With the threat of more pragmatic delay and deceit from Democrats the all out Burn Baby Burn/replacing Drill Baby Drill from the other party, all means Europe will have to carry the faster transition to Green Energy until our two parties are refunded or Ameicans can demand a refocus as Democrats once promised.   Mention this with hope RELL partners with a company like Emeron Group that is making tremendous progress in Europe and even France where regulatory market is demanding but Emeron is opening up the market there too."
