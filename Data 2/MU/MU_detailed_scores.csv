Yahoo,2024-10-24,"From Barron&#39;s at 10:30 AM: South Korean memory-chip maker SK Hynix is continuing to reap the benefits of the artificial-intelligence boom. That bodes well for its U.S. rival Micron Technology.K Hynix said sales of HBM products rose more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than quadrupled from the same period last year. SK Hynix and Micron are both producing HBM chips for Nvidia, while their rival Samsung Electronics has struggled to qualify as a supplier for the AI chip maker.SK Hynix is the current leader in HBM chips, with close to 50% market share according to research firm TrendForce. However, Micron is targeting 20%-25% HBM share at some point in 2025, according to analysts at BofA Global Research.For now there looks to be plenty of demand to go around. Micron has already said its HBM capacity is sold out through next year.The South Korean company&#39;s message about the wider market for memory chips also looks good for Micron. SK Hynix said the average selling price of both DRAM and NAND chips rose in the mid 10% range compared with the previous quarter. DRAM stands for dynamic random-access memory, which is used in desktop computers and servers, while NAND is flash memory, found in smartphones and solid-state hard drives.Micron shares were up 1.0% in morning trading on Thursday.

So, possibly this is the reason for the choppy movement i.e. it&#39;s neither up nor down right now.",Negative,-1,0.9933131337165833,Main

Moving forward to 2025, Micron’s EPS is projected to surge to $9.71, driven by its role in supporting the growing infrastructure needs for AI and cloud computing. Alongside this earnings growth, the price target for Micron is climbing, with analysts expecting an average price of $143 to $150, and some even projecting as high as $250. While there is an outlier who predicts a low of $67, the consensus remains overwhelmingly bullish. In contrast, AI-generated predictions suggest a more conservative range of $106 to $133, focusing on short-term (12-month) market data and technical indicators. These AI models provide forecasts based on recent trends but don’t incorporate broader qualitative insights that human analysts often consider, such as long-term strategic developments or market catalysts.

Yahoo,2024-10-01,"memory and storage components makes it a great stock to buy on the dip. The company just reported better-than-expected financial results for fiscal Q4 (which ended Aug. 29), with strong data center demand sending revenue up 93% year over year.

Increasing demand for Micron&#39;s memory chips should continue in calendar 2025, driven by AI, automotive, and data centers. Growth in the AI server market is expected to drive demand for Micron&#39;s high-capacity dynamic random access memory (DRAM) modules. Statista projects the AI server market to increase tenfold to $430 billion by 2033, which could fuel strong growth for Micron&#39;s data center business.

Other markets are expected to pick up next year. Micron&#39;s automotive revenue hit a record in fiscal 2024. The increase in infotainment and driver assistance systems is increasing the number of chips per vehicle. This is a long-term growth opportunity that is expected to drive more demand in the second half of fiscal 2025.

PC and mobile are two more opportunities for growth next year, where Micron is a leading supplier of memory and solid-state storage drives. PC unit volumes are anticipated to accelerate in the second half of the year, driven by upgrades to new AI-powered PCs and Microsoft&#39;s discontinued support for older versions of its Windows OS. The release of more AI-enabled smartphones will drive similar demand trends for Micron&#39;s mobile business.",Positive,1,1.0,Main

Moreover, the overall market is in a stable bullish trend going out of September (a month historically associated with weak market returns). Under my estimates, the stock has an upside to about $135-140 right now within the short-to-medium term, depending on overall bullish sentiment. This represents an upside of 34%-36%. On the other hand, we have this whole worry about the port strike, which could easily translate into a 5-8% additional downside from current price levels.

Moreover, its quarterly operating cash flow of $3.41 billion was 37.5% higher on a Q/Q basis. Much of this came from strong AI-related demand in data center servers and associated DRAM memory chips from Micron Technology. As a result, the company said it now expects next year revenue will rise at least 15%.Moreover, operating cash flow (OCF) grew from 36.4% of revenue to almost 44% (i.e., 43.9% of sales). However, this has also resulted in a huge increase in the company&#39;s capex spending. The table below shows that capex/sales ratios rose from just over 30% to over 40% of sales.

The correct model for this current wave of big data LLM based AI is a central repository of data that is tapped into by local fast non-volatile and RAM based parameters and data. Actually there is a new type of RAM needed which is write occasionally-insequence-read-lots-insequence-volatile which will be cheaper in silicon real estate. WD does not win much in this scenario though they will do OK with overall exponential &#34;cheap&#34; data growth i.e. personal data and rarely referred to data. It is the local 2 tiers of fast data that must grow i.e. where Micron is in the sweet spot with inference e.g. HBM.Micron got lucky that OpenAI sparked off this latest craze that should run for a few more years eventually to be replaced by data and compute efficient AI in perhaps 4 years time. But by that time AI apps and use will have grown exponentially to offset compute and memory efficiency. Micron has likely at least until 2030 of demand driven margins and growth before this matures to cyclic revenue. That cyclic model is of course in the bin now so a lot of folks will be wrong footed.

Yahoo,2024-09-26,"Piper Sandler: Micron reported a solid quarter, nicely beating street expectations for the reported quarter and the guide for the November quarter, Kumar noted. His core Micron thesis is playing out very well; near-term supply is capped as there are virtually no wafer fab equipment (WFE) supply increases while rising units across various industries and HBM size and demand are putting pressure on the industry and driving up prices, he said. The analyst continues to expect pricing to increase for both DRAM and NAND. On HBM, capacity for 2024 and 2025 is sold out, and Micron is contracted into pricing and units for both years, Kumar said. He noted a multi-design cadence on HBM for Micron and expects the rising demand and limited supply to help his overall thesis. The analyst does not expect meaningful WFE to come on until 2027. As such, he remains constructive on Micron. Kumar projected first-quarter revenue of $8.70 billion and EPS of $1.74.",Positive,1,1.0,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-25,"There are 4 ways that Kamala Harris wants to raise your taxes on your investments:She wants to tax long term capital gains and qualified dividends as &#34;ordinary income&#34;.So, if you sell your MU stock for a $10,000 LT capital gain and you&#39;re in the 24% marginaltax bracket for your regular income, you would pay $2,400 for the gain instead of $1,500 (15%).She wants the tax reductions from 2017 to expire. That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects MU) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of MU to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity.",Neutral,0,0.9998766183853149,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-25,"Micron Technology (MU) seems to be heading in a promising direction for 2024, largely driven by the increasing demand for AI-related memory chips. Here’s a summary of the key points regarding its financial performance and outlook:Revenue Surge: For Q4 of the fiscal year 2024, Micron is expected to report revenues of approximately $7.65 billion, nearly double the $4.01 billion from the same quarter last year. This growth is primarily driven by the rising demand in sectors such as AI, data centers, and edge devices.Net Income Recovery: The expected net income for the quarter is around $1 billion, a significant improvement from the $1.43 billion loss in Q4 2023. This reflects a substantial recovery in Micron&#39;s financial health.Challenges with Inventory: Despite the positive revenue outlook, Micron faces challenges related to inventory buildup. However, this is expected to improve by the end of 2024, which could lead to stronger revenue and improved gross margins.Future Growth: Analysts are optimistic about further revenue growth in early 2025, which could continue to strengthen Micron&#39;s profitability. This is particularly relevant given the current trends in AI and data processing requirements.Overall Position: Micron&#39;s current performance indicates a much stronger position compared to earlier in the year, primarily due to trends in AI technology, although the company is still dealing with issues related to older memory components.In summary, Micron Technology is indeed experien",Positive,1,1.0,Main

Revenue is projected to nearly double from $4.01 billion last year to $7.66 billion this quarter. Given these projections, it seems likely that Micron will beat expectations, with the potential for a positive surprise in both earnings and revenue, driven by strong demand in the AI and data center markets.

Yahoo,2024-09-25,"Ok honest thoughts today. I think many holders tested the waters with seeing how high we go today. I think many were disappointed with no strong push to 96 area and above. I think a close around 94.50 would be enough to gap above 94.85 into the 95 and fly off open. I don’t know if that will be the case until premarket tomorrow. I do believe there will be exitors tomorrow and possibly late buys because of the appetite of risk. My rule of thumb typically is if a strong Green Day on earnings typically the results are bad.  The number of calls is about a 65:35 ratio. Either the majority is wrong, as it’s too good to be true or market makers will be making sure the calls are burned. With that being said, I would not be surprised if calls are burned before earnings tomorrow. If it’s a red day I would be ever so inclined to believe MU will blow earnings out the water even more. I believe earnings will be good and guidance to be poor. Typically good earnings result sometimes in decline in stock price. I tell those if you want to play options tomorrow to do so an hour before close. I watched dell earnings day be 105 in premarket 113 top, close 110 and jump to 117 after hours. I expect the same for MU. I also believe MU will mention nvda in their report. I don’t buy the story that Nvda went up a day before MU earnings bc the ceo stopped selling.

Yahoo,2024-09-22,"Micron Technology (MU) stock is currently considered a strong buy by analysts, with an average 12-month price target of $149.2, representing a potential increase of over 64% from its current price of around $90. The highest price target is set at $225, reflecting significant confidence in the stock’s potential for growth in 2024. This optimism is supported by projections of strong revenue growth, with estimates suggesting an increase from $25.82 billion in 2024 to $39.70 billion in 2025, alongside a projected EPS growth from $1.26 to $9.71 over the same period. Several firms, including Bank of America and Cantor Fitzgerald, have recently raised their price targets, highlighting Micron’s potential as an undervalued stock in the memory and storage sectors.

From the article:
Danely added in his Friday note that a lot of the investors he talked to expect the guidance Micron gives for its November quarter to be below consensus estimates -- earnings of $1.58 a share on revenue of $8.35 billion, according to FactSet. &#34;The main &#39;bear thesis&#39; we heard was negative DRAM [dynamic random- access memory] pricing in 4Q24, 1Q25, and 2Q25 with C25 EPS of $9.41 being cut in half due to lower demand from the PC/handset markets,&#34; he wrote.

Yahoo,2024-09-19,"MS call is hard to understand because they double downgraded Hynix but maintained Samsung at buy.   Their call rests on 1) Legacy memory is in trouble because of slow sales of mobile and PC. 2). HBM oversupply because Hynix was a monopoly, but Samsung and Micron are entering the market, resulting in oversupply until 2026.  The problem with this analysis is that Samsung is far more exposed to legacy memory (no HBM as of yet).  And if HBM oversupply is the problem until 2026, that makes little sense, because Hynix and Micron have already sold out their planned HBM for 2025.   If HBM oversupply happens, Samsung will be the greatest victim because they have to sell their HBM to no demand.   Customers (NVDA) have already bought all they can use through prior contracts.   2026 will be an issue, but their own call says demand will catch up to supply by 2026.

As a matter of proof, I analyzed RELATIVE slope of MU bear markets with a death cross, versus percentage the price had yet to retreat since the death cross print day until bottomed. There were approx few of them: Nov’14 – Feb’16 ~65%, May’18 – Dec’18 ~32%, Apr’21 – Oct’21 ~12% Jan’22 – Sep’22 ~30% And current Jun’24 – Sep’24. Looking at a relative steepness and rapidness of the June – September decline comparing to past periods, this time both pairs of moving averages are lagging way behind and the death cross is too late to the show to indicate any extra percentage of price decline. i.e. the stock has bottomed and is already in upswing.

Yahoo,2024-09-12,"With 67 PT the BNP Paribas analyst exaggerates his projection, or really understands very little. I am from tech analyst side, so couple of facts here: PT 67 implies a .83 retracement of the upward wave the stock saw since fall &#39;22 (48-157-?67). Last time the only comparable numbers were in 2015 and since then the stock retreats were not more than .67-.7 Prior to a 2015 downtrend, it had preceding 7 fold growth! while last 9 years, growth was not more than 3.2 times bottom price. It is very unlikely the stock will give up 83 per cent this time since the overall volatility has decreased. (Look for MU trade ideas on tradingview)

Also the analyst is not so credible at least wrt MU: Last time he covered the stock was in 2022 and when at 53, he set his price target 75. After that, following two years due to some reason he didn&#39;t cover on all unstoppable upswing to 157 

I am not too deep in their biz specifics, but looking at fundamentals, MU struggles on PE multiple, but has a fwd PE of 7.50 on quarterly basis/ 9.5 annual basis. Its current price-to-sales is 5, I also optionally calculate fwd price-to-sales, on annual basis it&#39;s 2.8! (calculated a week ago). These are among lowest multiples in semi industry. (Look at AMD fwd PE 25 that never happens, current PE is 170)

All in all, I am sure PT of 67 is overwhelmed. the stock with such low ratios can&#39;t just drop 83 per cent from ATH, while industry averages are times higher. I see it can instead easily bounce to ATH next twelve mnths😀",Neutral,0,0.6683557629585266,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-12,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120  

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) makes and sells memory and storage products. Despite significant investments in AI technology, the firm’s financial health remains robust, continuing to offer strong value compared to its competitors. Analysts predict the company&#39;s third-quarter revenue will surge by over 90% year-over-year, with an expected earnings per share (EPS) increase of more than 200% for the same period. Projections suggest the firm will maintain a year-over-year revenue growth rate of over 40% for at least the next six quarters. Micron has already sold out high bandwidth memory capacity until 2025.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has thus garnered positive attention from Wall Street due to its impressive performance. KeyBanc has given the stock an Overweight rating and a price target of $145. In a note to investors, the advisory expressed confidence in Micron&#39;s ability to capture a larger share of the high-bandwidth memory market, potentially surpassing its share in traditional DRAM products. This is partly driven by concerns that Samsung may struggle to match Micron’s manufacturing yields in this area.

Overall MU ranks 10th on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",Positive,1,1.0,Main

So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on MU stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on MU stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.

Yahoo,2024-08-29,"11:17 AM EDT, 08/29/2024 (MT Newswires) -- Nvidia&#39;s (NVDA) fiscal Q2 &#34;masterpiece performance&#34; underpins the bullish outlook for the artificial-intelligence &#34;revolution,&#34; &#34;Wedbush said Thursday in a note.

&#34;The tech stalwart delivered massive &#39;drop the mic&#39; numbers yet again that easily beat the Street&#34; as revenue more than doubled with a &#34;robust outlook&#34; for fiscal Q2, Wedbush said
&#34;A meteoric enterprise pipeline speaks to this AI Revolution just starting to kick off its next phase of growth,&#34; Wedbush said.
&#34;AI GPU demand is way outstripping supply for Nvidia at this juncture, and the Street should come away from these results as a very bullish indicator for the broader tech sector with more shock and awe rather than a shrug of the shoulders,&#34; Wedbush said.
Every $1 spent on Nvidia&#39;s graphics processing unit chip is estimated to generate an $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector, Wedbush said.
&#34;The stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025&#34; as the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates and &#34;a macro soft landing remains the path,&#34; Wedbush said.",Positive,1,0.9999996423721313,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-22,"Micron price target lowered by $10 at Susquehanna, here&#39;s why 07:43 MU Susquehanna lowered the firm&#39;s price target on Micron to $175 from $185 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares.The firm updated estimates following the company&#39;s recent commentary that Nov-Q DRAM/NAND bit shipment tracking to flattish Q/Q while also incorporating our most updated pricing assumptions and arguing that the Memory is currently in a &#34;mid-cycle&#34; correction in the middle of a longer up-cycle.The news aabout Nov-Q DRAM/NAND bit shipments tracking flattish Q/Q came out a few weeks ago when the CFO spoke correct?  Simply means MU may not sell more DRAM/NAND then they had thought, thus lowering their PT from $185 to $175 because this would mean a slightly less EPS for 2025.  We&#39;ll see.  MU hard to predicate what MU will do each QTR lots of complexities in predicting EPS over a year.  What is more important is that MU can continue the trend int 2026.  This will stabilize MU stock price and will extend the upward trend throught the full 2025 CY.  This to me is the most important, as the market is looking out 6-12 months and as soon as their is a hint that things &#34;might&#34; be slowing down in 6-12 months, MU stock price movement upward will stahl.Still happy with their PT of $175.",Positive,1,0.9997933506965637,Main

Call was very positive from MU, said that certain customers did not want to pay the price, so MU decided to keep in inventory for a few months because they could get a higher price in a few months and that it would help fill the sold out 2025 inventory / demand - makes sense.  What I don&#39;t really get, is the KeyBanc said that it lowered because MU said pricing was not where they thought it would be, but that is in this QTR-4 of 2023 ending August 2024.  Not in FY 2025 for Micron.MU also said on the call that the AI upward momentum will continue for years, e.g. 2026.  So that is very positive for Revenue and Earnings etc.---------Here is what KeyBanc said after their call with MU yesterday - Aug. 5th, 2024KeyBanc analyst John Vinh lowered the firm&#39;s price target on Micron to $145 from $165 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Presenting at KBCM&#39;s Technology Leadership Forum, management provided an update and trimmed its outlook for Q1 to flat bit shipments quarter-over-quarter from prior expectations of modest sequential growth, the firm notes. Micron noted its customers in PC/smartphones had prebuilt inventory, while end-demand in auto, industrial, and consumer end markets was weak. As a result, Micron noted the pricing environment was weaker than expected and therefore has walked away from less favorable deals, KeyBanc adds.---------",Positive,1,0.9999916553497314,Main

“HBM market share goals intact: management reiterated its goal of achieving a market share position in High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) that is consistent with the company&#39;s overall DRAM market share (i.e. ~20%) at some point in CY2025. The company continues to expect several hundred million dollars of HBM revenue in FY2024 which steps up materially to multiple billion dollars in FY2025.”

« HBM volumes and pricing through CY2025 largely fixed: given the premium value proposition afforded by the HBM3E product, and the company&#39;s notable 30% power consumption advantage vis-à-vis peers, customers have had the incentive to lock in long-term agreements (LTAs) with Micron. In fact, per management, the company is sold out (i.e. HBM bits have been allocated) for both CY2024 and CY2025, while pricing negotiations are also nearly complete through CY2025.»",Positive,1,0.9999996423721313,Main
