This is done far away from current price where would be happy to sell at. For example for Friday the 125 strike option would bring in 15 per 100 shares. So with 5000 shares could sell 50 option contracts to get 15 50 750 paid to you. Seems small but if do this for say 20 weeks it adds up real quick. Main downside is price moves above 125 would still be forced to sell at 125 unless buy the option back. Not financial advice."

Its the same as blockchain, 3D printers, and crypto. Its all hype and of no real use. Even with Nvidias earnings, its fair value is in the 40s. The stock is only up 7 dollars in 4 months. Thats nothing to brag about. With the Nasdaq double topping, rates being cut, yield curve univerting, and a thousand other recession indicators, Id be careful about bragging. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 in September of 07. There were 6 weeks of gains before the bear market and recession. 6 weeks is coming up and its coming whether you like it or not. Now you can pray that it goes to 500. That would make it the size of Chinas whole economy. Whats the bad part about cashing in? The NASDAQ went up 40 percent this year and the options prices are pointing downward. Is it worth the loss? Thursday its going back towards 135"

So if market price of shares is 124 on Friday, and you sell 50 options for price of 125, your options would expire without any value left to them, and you get to keep both shares, and what someone paid you for the options. Reason is because if market price for Nvidia on Friday is say 124 but call option is for 125 it makes no sense for someone to buy shares from you via the option for 1 extra vs what they can pay on the market. Once that option expires can write another one for a much higher price for the next week. Trick is to pick a price that would be ok selling the shares at, and a price that is unlikely to be hit within a week."

It’s a very important topic for us. And I think we’ve been really consistent in saying that over time, our leadership position in IT infrastructure services, with the benefits that we’re generating from the 3A’s really should allow us to expand our margins and then ultimately be in a position to consider regularly returning capital to shareholders, all while remaining investment grade, which is really important to us. We do not need to be at a — in my opinion, we don’t need to be at $1 billion of pretax income in order to be able to return capital to shareholders but nothing will come of nothing. And I think the key metric that will determine our ability to return capital to shareholders is really is our adjusted pretax income.And to me, it needs to be higher than 1% of revenue, which is where it was last year, where it is on an LTM basis. That’s what really needs to move up in order for us to be generating the sustainable free cash flow and earnings levels and margin that’s supportive of providing capital returns."
