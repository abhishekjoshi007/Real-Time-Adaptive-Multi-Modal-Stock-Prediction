Reddit,2024-09-11,Selling weekly call options that have a strike price for say 125 this week. So if options get excersised someone will pay you 125 for each share you own. This is done far away from current price where would be happy to sell at. For example for Friday the 125 strike option would bring in 15 per 100 shares. So with 5000 shares could sell 50 option contracts to get 15 50 750 paid to you. Seems small but if do this for say 20 weeks it adds up real quick. Main downside is price moves above 125 would still be forced to sell at 125 unless buy the option back. Not financial advice.,Neutral,0,0.9982995390892029,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-11,"With options you dont sell shares. You sell the ability to buy your shares at some price. So if market price of shares is 124 on Friday, and you sell 50 options for price of 125, your options would expire without any value left to them, and you get to keep both shares, and what someone paid you for the options. Reason is because if market price for Nvidia on Friday is say 124 but call option is for 125 it makes no sense for someone to buy shares from you via the option for 1 extra vs what they can pay on the market. Once that option expires can write another one for a much higher price for the next week. Trick is to pick a price that would be ok selling the shares at, and a price that is unlikely to be hit within a week.",Neutral,0,0.9994463324546814,Reply
