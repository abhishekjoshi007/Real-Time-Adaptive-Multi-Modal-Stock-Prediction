Yahoo,2024-10-30,"So it&#39;s helpful to think about what could be the temporary &#34;risk off&#34; downside. On Aug 5, AMD fell to a low of $121.83/share before closing at $134.82. The lowest close this year was August 7: it closed that day  $128.67. But a more useful metric is looking at how AMD behaved on May 1, 2024: low of $142.14 and high of $144.27/share. That was the range where the market placed this stock in line with an annual growth expectation in the low double-digits - exactly what AMD will be delivering (~11.7% growth at the lower end of the range).  It&#39;s not their fault that irrational exuberance took this stock to a high of $227.30. So a $144/share valuation is almost already in the bag. Given that AMD is expected going to grow by over 20%, the stock will easily be in the $170 to $180 range a year from now. That&#39;s an attractive buy to day at the current price.

Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies and growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear.",Neutral,0,0.9316918849945068,Main

If AMD needs chips, I hope it will get in touch with our new factory being built by Corning.  It&#39;s right next to HSC (Hemlock Semiconductor).

On another note, graphene has hundreds of uses for technology.  I believe it could be used in chip creation because it has the strength of steel, the flexibility of rubber, and can be super extremely thin, stacked so that many layers can increase the chips&#39; power.

And the ensuing 3 decades plus the Japanese continued to eat our lunch and dominate everything. U.S. companies, despite decades of knowing what they were up against didn‚Äôt seem to want to strap it on and compete. Instead, a continual loss of market shares. It seemed their business strategy was mostly begging for help and tax payer bailouts. Now, with EVs virtually forced onto the consumer (who by the way doesn‚Äôt want them‚Ä¶most people overwhelmingly)! So now the chinese are the main serious players in the ev market and will dominate reminiscent of the Japanese before them. See the trend where more and more manufacturing jobs leave this country with major help from the politicians? That‚Äôs where tariffs would be incredibly effective. But, since mostly the dems have turned this country over to china, making us a colony; if elected, harris, who is owned by the chinese will gladly continue that trend. Losing tax base and turning what‚Äôs left into Flint. By the way, I was raised in Flint and know the auto industry very well.

Yahoo,2024-10-17,"One theory on how AMD is being sand bagged by HFs is that they are shorting AMD and buying NVDA as a hedge (actually AMD is the hedge trade as short). NVDA goes up faster than AMD and goes down slower which allows HFs to rake in a lot of money. They did the same when intc had some value which caused AMD to go side ways some years back before share price broke $100 (similar trade when AMD announced xlnx merger). Su needs to be able to brake this trend but she cannot because she is just too conservative compared to Jensen also her timing is quite terrible (i.e the xlnx deal that closed several months late and allowed street to have a field day). Today with the TSMC news, you would think AMD would go back to $170 range (where we were before the AI event) quickly but unfortunately NVDA will break thru ATH while AMD will get stuck in the mud around $160-$161 and even will get taken below $160.

For EUV there are only three customers:  TSMC, Intel and Samsung (they are the only ones using EUV).  Intel is building fabs like crazy, but did announce about a month ago  a slower contruction pace at its Germany site.  But Intel has already bought up ASML&#39;s entire 2024 high NA EUV capacity, so Intel likely has not much more to purchase.  TSMC is building one new fab in AZ, and Samsung is building in Texas.   Wafers go thru fabs about 6-12 months before a product hits the market.  And new tools from ASML would be purchased 12-24 months before they even go into use.  Thus, whatever slowing of ASML reports now would not affect the end product companies (AMD, Intel, Nvidia...) for at least 2-3 years...maybe even longer.  Is TSMC showing any signs of slowing?  Seems to me they are backlogged and have customers knocking down the door for N3 capacity, and soon N2 capacity.

I just went to Costco this past weekend, and there are only 3 Ryzen-powered laptops on the floor. Absolutely pathetic, and that&#39;s 2 more models than there usually are!

The bullish price action reminds investors why &#34;the trend is your friend.&#34; Can stocks continue to melt up heading into Election Day? It&#39;s certainly a possibility but some occasional pullbacks wouldn&#39;t be a surprise. Next week it&#39;s all about Q3 earnings reports and Thursday&#39;s Retail Sales report. The last couple of Retail Sales reports have been stronger than expected, so this data point will provide a good read on the state of the U.S. consumer. Earlier today we learned that CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor showed a 0.3% month/month drop in consumer spending, which could suggest a soft Retail Sales report. If so, this could be enough to trigger a profit taking pullback in stocks. However, the technicals remain bullish (more on this in the &#34;Technical Take&#34; section below) and if NVDA can notch a fresh all-time high, or the RUT can break out to fresh two-year highs next week, these would likely be near-term bullish catalysts.

Intel has problems, but they still control 95%+ of the personal computer chip space. AMD needs to go after that. Nvidia holds 95% of market share in their space too. AMD needs to go after that too. These are the reasons AMD is stagnant and is flat YTD.",Negative,-1,0.9998816251754761,Main
Yahoo,2024-10-11,"What is AMD&#39;s plan to compete with Intel? Yes Intel. Many view them as a has been, but lately, they are releasing some impressive products, Lunar Lake, Xeon 6, Arrow Lake. I think even their Gaudi 3 AI chip looks impressive, especially on a performance per cost basis, and they released Gaudi 3&#39;s specs on ML Perf which AMD hasn&#39;t done. Intel is in a tough spot and bleeding money while ramping up its new fab business. But they&#39;re inches from the finish line for their 18A process ( a &#34;1.8nm&#34; process) . It&#39;s already yielding well enough for high volume and it appears to be as good or better than TSMC N2 (which also should be used in H2 next year). Intel&#39;s newest products mentioned above actually use TSMC N3, but AMD was forced to use N4. Intel had prepaid for N3 capacity years ago and this prepay allowed them a better node than AMD. Will AMD be able to get on TSMC&#39;s favorite list and use N2 at the same time as Apple and Nvidia? Or will AMD be using N3, when Intel is using 18A, and Apple and Nvidia are hogging up all the N2 capacity at TSMC? This is a legit question and something people should be thinking about.   Also QCOM is now in the PC game.  They have a niche, which is Arm.  Intel has a niche which is vertical integration and future great nodes.  Now there is talk of Nvidia/Mediatek partnering to release a PC chip.  What is AMD&#39;s niche going to be?",Positive,1,0.9999998807907104,Main

Yahoo,2024-10-11,"Bernstein: ‚ÄúThe stock sold off during and following the event in a typical sell-the-news response, perhaps understandable given some modest excitement into the day, lack of huge surprises, and MI325X performance specs that we believe were likely somewhat disappointing relative to NVIDIA‚Äôs impending Blackwell launch. While we don‚Äôt want to minimize things we didn‚Äôt really hear anything to suggest we should anticipate substantial upside to current expectations, and would rather own NVDA at this point in front of Blackwell.‚Äù
Deutsche Bank: ‚ÄúWe view the event as a successful continuation of AMD&#39;s impressive execution in delivering high-quality Data Center innovations. The increase in its Accelerator TAM from $400b in 2027 to $500b in 2028 suggests continued confidence in the strong growth and share gain opportunities in an important market.‚Äù
‚ÄúOverall, we continue to expect AMD&#39;s Data Center segment to be a strong growth driver in 2025 via both share gains in CPUs and the potential for a near doubling of Instinct revenue.‚Äù
Bank of America: ‚ÄúNew MI325X performance generally remains a full year behind NVDA‚Äôs latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic. However, we highlight AMD‚Äôs multi-vector growth opportunities across data center CPUs and GPUs remain unchanged, with the current 5-7% AI accelerator share consensus outlook presenting a minimum $25bn+ opportunity by CY28E, and a bull-case scenario of 10% AI share over the long-term still on the table, given continued hardware, software stack, and networking improvements.‚Äù",Positive,1,1.0,Main

What could have been better than that? I guess what investors wanted to hear was &#34;AMD will grow its data center business x amount by March, 2025.&#34; If so, then what would AMD talk about in two weeks during the earnings call? Seems to me, if people want numbers, listen to the earnings call, as that will include questions from analysts. Note, zero audience participation yesterday, but analysts will be participating in two weeks. Two different purposes for two different presentations. Surely, the CEO knows her job is to set current and future operating expectations in very real terms during earnings calls. She also knows she is due to give another growth estimate for Mi-3xx like she did earlier in 2024 for 2024. She may not do that until the January earnings call looking out at 2025, which will tick off msg board posters even more. I think we&#39;ll know a lot more in two weeks, and unfortunately, it may be a signal to go back to sleep for another 3+ months. No matter what, the underlying message yesterday was AMD is playing the long game, take it or leave it, and strength in numbers will never burst on the scene overnight like it did w NVDA.

Yahoo,2024-10-10,"Here‚Äôs a condensed take on the good, bad, ugly, and fantastic from AMD‚Äôs AI event:

The Good

	‚Ä¢	MI300 Chips: AMD announced its MI300 series chips, which outperform Nvidia in certain AI workloads like memory bandwidth and inference, signaling serious competition in the AI space.
	‚Ä¢	Big Partnerships: Collaborations with Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle boost AMD‚Äôs credibility.

The Bad

	‚Ä¢	Market Skepticism: Investors are cautious about how quickly AMD can grow its AI market share given Nvidia‚Äôs dominance.

The Ugly

	‚Ä¢	Stock Drop: Despite promising announcements, AMD‚Äôs stock has dropped, likely due to a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù reaction and uncertainty about real-world performance.

The Fantastic

	‚Ä¢	Disruption Potential: If AMD‚Äôs claims hold, they could disrupt the AI hardware market and significantly expand their current market share by 2026, aiming for $10 billion in AI revenue.

This reflects both optimism and caution for AMD‚Äôs AI ambitions.",Positive,1,0.9978380799293518,Main

This means the Ryzen 9000 series will stand as the top performer for another generation, maybe two if the rumored cancellation of Arrow Lake refresh is true. Intel will have to compete on price, but their chips are more expensive to produce. That means lower margins and gives AMD pricing strength.

As of October 2024, AMD&#39;s stock has already gained around 20% this past month, driven by multiple strong tailwinds, including the AI boom and key partnerships in the GPU space. One of the biggest catalysts coming up is AMD‚Äôs &#34;Advancing AI&#34; event next week, where they are expected to showcase next-generation Instinct and EPYC processors. These are vital for AI workloads and data centers, areas where AMD has been making significant strides.With NVIDIA dominating the AI space, AMD‚Äôs competitive pricing for their new MI300X chips has caught the attention of major players like Oracle, which recently chose AMD&#39;s GPUs for their AI superclusters. This strategic positioning could lead to explosive growth in AMD‚Äôs data center GPU business. Analysts are optimistic, expecting MI300 chip sales to hit $4.5 billion, potentially even higher.Given these developments, along with favorable macroeconomic conditions like recent interest rate cuts that benefit tech stocks, AMD looks primed for further gains.

Yahoo,2024-10-03,"Here is what&#39;s at risk with taxes on us Investors in November&#39;s election:Kamala Harris and Biden together stated last winter that they would liketo tax long-term capital gains as &#34;ordinary income&#34;. So, an AMD investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects AMD the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors. All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for AMD. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know.

Yahoo,2024-09-30,"As AMD flexes its muscles in the AI game, it is not only introducing new hardware but is betting on software too, trying to hit new market segments not already dominated by Nvidia.Thus, AMD has unveiled its first small language model, AMD-135M, which belongs to the Llama family and is aimed at private business deployments. It is unclear whether the new model has to do anything with the company&#39;s recent acquisition of Silo AI (as the deal has to be finalized and cleared by various authorities, so probably not), but this is a clear step in the direction of addressing the needs of specific customers with a pre-trained model done by AMD - using AMD hardware for inference.The main reason why AMD&#39;s models are fast is because they use so-called speculative decoding. Speculative decoding introduces a smaller &#39;draft model&#39; that generates multiple candidate tokens in a single forward pass. Tokens are then passed to a larger, more accurate &#39;target model&#39; that verifies or corrects them. On the one hand, this approach allows for multiple tokens to be generated simultaneously, yet on the other hand this comes at the cost of power due to increased data transactions.",Neutral,0,0.8868252635002136,Main

The recent announcement of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure‚Äôs deployment of AMD‚Äôs MI300X GPUs for their latest Compute Supercluster instance signifies a strong vote of confidence in AMD‚Äôs technology. This deployment, which supports a substantial number of 16,384 MI300X GPUs, represents a significant adoption of AMD‚Äôs GPUs in the cloud computing space, underscoring AMD‚Äôs competitive positioning and potential for growth in this sector. The focus on GPU inference capabilities, which is expected to be a key theme at AMD‚Äôs forthcoming AI Event, further highlights the strategic direction AMD is taking to solidify its footprint in the high-performance computing market.Additionally, the anticipation of the MI325X GPU, which boasts an increased memory bandwidth and is set to commence shipping in the fourth quarter of 2024, positions AMD favorably against competitors. This upcoming GPU, expected to feature a substantial upgrade in memory capacity, will likely enhance AMD‚Äôs product offering and appeal to customers seeking high-performance computing solutions. Rakers also notes AMD‚Äôs commitment to a 12-month product cycle cadence, which is indicative of the company‚Äôs focus on sustained innovation and timely market delivery. This strategic approach, along with the expected significant increase in AI performance in the upcoming MI350-series GPUs, is indicative of AMD‚Äôs robust pr",Positive,1,1.0,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-26,"There are 4 ways that Kamala Harris wants to raise your taxes on your investments:She wants to tax long term capital gains and qualified dividends as &#34;ordinary income&#34;.So, if you sell your AMD stock for a $10,000 LT capital gain and you&#39;re in the 24% marginaltax bracket for your regular income, you would pay $2,400 for the gain instead of $1,500 (15%).She wants the tax reductions from 2017 to expire. That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects AMD) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of AMD to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;.

Yahoo,2024-09-25,"There are 4 ways that Kamala Harris wants to raise your taxes on your investments:She wants to tax long term capital gains and qualified dividends as &#34;ordinary income&#34;.So, if you sell your AMD stock for a $10,000 LT capital gain and you&#39;re in the 24% marginaltax bracket for your regular income, you would pay $2,400 for the gain instead of $1,500 (15%).She wants the tax reductions from 2017 to expire. That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects AMD) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of AMD to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;.

In context of that, today‚Äôs move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago, when the company gained 10.9% as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&amp;P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia&#39;s outstanding earnings results.During its Q4&#39;2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street&#39;s estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter.The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications. Guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations.Overall, Nvidia&#39;s strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.",Positive,1,1.0,Main

Interesting recent developments: they just broke ground for a large new R&amp;D center in Taiwan right next to TSM and the new NVDA center in the Taiwan silicon valley. AMD has been around for a while, but the new CEO Lisa Su is a cousin of NVDA Jensen Huang. She arrived Taiwan a week after him. There&#39;s plenty of near to mid term growth in AI. The Taiwan model is full steam pursuit of leading edge excellence. Because each company is focused sharply, other companies focus on other things. This means every one can charge a premium price. It breeds an upward virtual market spiral. In Chicom mainland China, they try to do everything and compete with low price and high quantity. This leads to low quality and a downward descending vicious spiral, doesn&#39;t matter electronics to cars.Back to our original subject, current positioning in the AI companies are such that companies with competitive products can do well.

While the company posted a 6.4% increase in revenue and a 30.5% rise in earnings over the last 12 months, this growth pales in comparison to that of its main rival, Nvidia. This relative underperformance is driven by AMD‚Äôs continued focus on hardware efficiency.Analysts forecast a nearly 13% increase in revenue for AMD this year, reaching $25.62 billion, along with a 27.6% rise in EPS. While the outlook is strong, AMD‚Äôs recent results have been disappointing. Despite a 115% year-over-year revenue increase in the company‚Äôs Data Center segment during Q2, AMD‚Äôs revenue from chips and processors used in video game consoles fell by 59% to $648 million. In contrast, Nvidia‚Äôs gaming revenues increased by 16% year-over-year.

Yahoo,2024-09-08,"Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America: A Recent History by Kurt Andersen...Read it or listen at Amazon.During the 20th century, America managed to make its economic and social systems both more and more fair and more and more prosperous. A huge, secure, and contented middle class emerged. All boats rose together. But then the New Deal gave way to the Raw Deal. Beginning in the early 1970s, by means of a long war conceived of and executed by a confederacy of big business CEOs, the superrich, and right-wing zealots, the rules and norms that made the American middle class possible were undermined and dismantled. The clock was turned back on a century of economic progress, making greed good, workers powerless, and the market all-powerful while weaponizing nostalgia, lifting up an oligarchy that served only its own interests, and leaving the huge majority of Americans with dwindling economic prospects and hope.Why and how did America take such a wrong turn? In this deeply researched and brilliantly woven cultural, economic, and political chronicle, Kurt Andersen offers a fresh, provocative, and eye-opening history of America&#39;s undoing, naming names, showing receipts, and unsparingly assigning blame - to the radical right in economics and the law, the high priests of high finance, a complacent and complicit Establishment, and liberal &#34;useful idiots&#34;, among whom he includes himself.",Neutral,0,0.6229055523872375,Main

Why are absolutely none of these unmistakeable harbingers of American decline laid where they belong - at the door of Ronald Reagan?The so-called liberal media (or any other media for that matter) never criticizes the saintly Reagan. This disconnect between the Reagan of Myth and the Reagan of Reality has been palpable in the media for many years. The only story that is ever allowed to get out is the one put out by the ideological fanatics and free market zealots of the Reagan propaganda machine.",Negative,-1,0.6706343293190002,Main

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like AMD to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax AMD would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of AMD stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on AMD stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on AMD stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.

Yahoo,2024-09-02,"We hear about Satya, Elon, and Jensen 100x as often, but Lisa Su might be the most impressive CEO of the last decade.

When she took over as the CEO of AMD in 2014, they had 20 days of cash left. They had more than $2B in debt. They had just sold their headquarters and laid off a quarter of the company.

Their chips were four years behind Intel, who dominated all but the low-price end of the laptop market. They had only 2% of the server market.

The market cap had fallen to just $3B.


Su rallied the company around three principles:

1. Create great products
2. Deepen customer trust
3. Simplify the company


She invested in R&amp;D, and has grown it 4x over her tenure. She prioritized a new chip architecture called Zen which launched in 2017. By 2020 it was the fastest chip on the market.

She used the momentum to sign deals with Lenovo, Sony, Google, and Amazon. She acquired Xilinx for almost $50B.
Today AMD has grown to 33% share of the server chip market by revenue and gaining. Revenue is &gt;$20B.
Market cap is $240B.

The next prize is the Al chip market, where Su is competing head to head with her cousin, Jensen Huang.

Yes, it‚Äôs true, Nvidia has been working on redesigning the CoWoS package to mitigate these material expansion issues. This has gone deeper than they first thought involving modification the materials used, optimizing the packaging structure, and even exploring alternative packaging methods.  Several push backs have been encountered.Nvidia is also taking this time to look at making adjustments to the manufacturing process itself to ensure that the packaging is assembled and tested more carefully to identify and address any other potential defects earlier on.But here is the kicker, Nvidia never realized these new supply chain demands. ¬† So in addition to the actual packaging challenges they are facing, supply chain constraints are surfacing related to the production of the necessary components for the Blackwell GPU redesign.

Yahoo,2024-08-30,"Jensen didn&#39;t answer the question about packaging issues for Blackwell. He instead answered a question that wasn&#39;t asked, saying that they had done a new masking for (single die, aka B200A) Blackwell chips to improve yield, and that the Blackwell&#39;s functionality was just fine. The issue is about the interposer &#34;gluing&#34; the single dies together in B100, B200 and GB200. 

Imagine it&#39;s early next year and AMD releases the full specs on MI350, to be released later in the year... If Nvidia and TSMC don&#39;t sort out their CoWoS-L trouble, MI350X will probably become the most performant chip in the world. 

FWIW I don&#39;t think they will be able to fix it. The issue is the interposer in CoWoS-L consisting of both elemental silicon and organic parts, and those materials having different coefficients of thermal expansion ‚Äî one expands much more when heated, causing bending (&#34;warpage&#34;). How would you resolve that, without a fundamental redesign? 

Solid state physics is pretty unforgiving if you&#39;re on the wrong track. See QuantumScape for example. IMO they rushed this technology to market (&#34;1 year cycle&#34;) before they were certain of its viability. But time will tell.",Neutral,0,0.9988875985145569,Main

In turn, their nvl36 and nvl72 clusters are built on top of those. That&#39;s their top selling product, really. An NVL72 with GB200 is scheduled to sell at $3M.

AMD doesn&#39;t have a competitor yet, but might have one if MI350X allows more bandwidth for interconnects, and Broadcom releases new NIC switches that support Infinity Fabric. 

However, for most fine tuning and inference tasks like Llama 3 LLMs, that&#39;s overkill, and a simple node or a cluster of 8 suffices. 

While &#34;at least 3 months&#34; is an annoyance for NVDA, its customers and suppliers, if they don&#39;t get their act together by then, with all their promises, people will get annoyed and AMD might get a second look as a first choice.n",Neutral,0,0.713819682598114,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-23,"Now that it looks apparent that a triangle is forming at the end of wave-4, it will push the end of wave-5 further out.  I knew this morning that if price didn&#39;t rally further than what it did then something was off.  The answer is that wave-4 is not yet finished.  So, I will be expecting a grind up from here to make a small wave-D, then an additional decline on Monday for wave-E.  Price will not drop below the end of wave-C, which I am currently thinking is 151.83 (as long as wave-C is completed).  This would allow for a wave-5 rally end to time with NVDA earnings, interestingly enough.  This probably means AMD, and the market in general, will have a negative reaction as a result of those earnings.

Chances are that this will be the extended wave as well, although that will remain to be seen.

Infrastructure Investment: Musk has been a proponent of advanced technologies and infrastructure. A partnership could lead to increased investment in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and research and development.3. National Security Focus: Both figures have emphasized the importance of technological independence, especially in critical areas like semiconductors. This could lead to increased government support for domestic semiconductor production to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.4. Innovation and Technology Promotion: Musk&#39;s focus on cutting-edge technologies like AI and renewable energy could drive demand for advanced semiconductors, encouraging investments in the sector.5. Public-Private Partnerships: A collaboration could foster partnerships between government and private companies, facilitating funding and support for semiconductor initiatives.These factors combined could create a robust environment for growth in the semiconductor industry under such a leadership alignment.

Yahoo,2024-08-22,"1/4 pt rate cut is already baked into this market. If you‚Äôre counting on the markets skyrocketing over a rate cut this Fall you‚Äôll be sadly disappointed. Earnings and forecast still are the main indicators for a stock. Unfortunately AMD has mostly only been in-line the last 3 quarterly earnings and has not raised forecast. This is why it has struggled so much in 2024. It was at $227 in March and has since completely tanked. It‚Äôs up only 5% YTD while the markets and its main competitors are at / near ATHs. Until AMD enthusiastically raises forecast and starts blowing out earnings reports it‚Äôs going to be stuck in a tight trading range with possible more downward pressure. Nvidia‚Äôs earnings next week will raise AMD (a rising tide lifts all boats), but quickly afterwards AMD will be forced to stand on its own feet again.  We‚Äôve been in a recession since June. The government simply hasn‚Äôt told you that fact yet. It will announce it once the election is over in November. The employment numbers have already been revised (it‚Äôs likely that 800,000 is realistically more like 2M-3M). Inflation is still sky high, as are interest rates.

Yahoo,2024-08-22,"Since I am assuming this rally is indeed an impulse, I am confident there will be at least one more high before the rally finishes and there is a signficant correction. This will give the impulse rally the classic 5 wave look. This curent swoon is probably a wave-4.I have been attempting to look for bullish patterns that could signal more upside. Obiously, if the low at 120 was completion of the downside, then price action experienced an A-B-C correction from the 227 high. That would mean that, out of the triangle that formed near the bottom, this would be wave-1. A correction would be wave-2 and would go no lower than the 61.8% fib retracement level of the current rally. I&#39;ll estimate that level to be about 143. So, this is the area that I will assume a strong move and close below will signal continuation of the drop from 187, which will be considered wave-3 with a target of around 95-97 (moved up from my original target of 85-87 due to the prolonged rally).Another possible hint would be the structure of the next significant correction is seeing how strong the move down will be. A strong move down will likely indicate a wave-3 impulse. A choppy structure will probably indicate a corrective wave.",Positive,1,0.7521976232528687,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-21,"I still have a bearish bias. If this rally can&#39;t give a convincing close above 164.66, then I will continue to have a bearish bias because the downside impulse that I believe to have identified could still be intact. 164.66 is a significant level because its the 61.8% fib retracement level from the 187 top to the bottom of the assumed wave-1 at 134.05.As for the current rally, it has gone too far up to be considered a terminal wave (you&#39;d have heard me mention this pattern if you&#39;ve been following my posts).  With the further extension of the rally, it has now become disproportionate with itself and I no longer consider it a good representation of a terminal. As such, it must be an impulse since that&#39;s the only other motive wave that exists. In this regard, I believe there could be one more high left to create a recognizable 5 wave pattern. This would bring price above 162.04, possibly challenging the 61.8% fib retracement level at 164.66.If it happens, I assume this high will take place tomorrow, but could stretch out to Monday.  If price has a huge rally above the 164.66 level, then the pattern for a wave-2 will become invalidated and I will have to choice but to assume a further rally even upon corrections - so my bias would turn bullish.",Neutral,0,0.815994143486023,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-19,"Good morning, my friends on the Yahoo AMD messageboard. I trust you all had a relaxing and joyful weekend. Well, onto our continuous analysis of AMD price action. If you recalled, last week I ended with 2 scenarios, and I will repost them here:Begin quote:First, and what I am leaning towards right now, is that the structure after the X wave is a zig-zag pattern. Wave-A was the movement in the morning to the high at 149.37. The down move soon after was a wave-B, and it looks like a triangle. Out of the triangle, it would be wave-C. The measurements of possibile endpoints is the 61.8% fib ext at 150.45, or the 100% fib ext at 152.09. Failure of this structure happens below 147.84.The second scenario is that we are in a triangle top. Again, the morning&#39;s gap down is the X wave. The move up is wave-A, and the move down afterwards is wave-B. This current movement could be wave-C or we are still in wave-B and its subdivided (mean it has 3 waves itself). A drop below 147.84 probably confirms the triangle. This would mean that we won&#39;t see anymore upside.End quote.",Neutral,0,0.9998254179954529,Main

Unexpected events, such as natural disasters or political upheavals, can drastically alter outcomes.Behavioral Factors: Human behavior and sentiment play a significant role in these areas, and predicting how people will react to various events is inherently challenging.Focus on Long-Term Goals: Instead of trying to predict short-term movements, it‚Äôs often more effective to focus on long-term goals and strategies. This approach can help mitigate the impact of short-term volatility and uncertainty.In essence, the advice encourages individuals to avoid the stress and potential pitfalls of trying to predict the unpredictable and instead focus on more stable, long-term planning.Good Luck to All Longs!",Neutral,0,0.9998319149017334,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-16,"I am beginning to see a little bit of structure within the terminal wave-5. I am going to confidently say that this morning&#39;s gap down was an X wave. There are 2 possibilities moving forward.First, and what I am leaning towards right now, is that the structure after the X wave is a zig-zag pattern. Wave-A was the movement in the morning to the high at 149.37. The down move soon after was a wave-B, and it looks like a triangle. Out of the triangle, it would be wave-C. The measurements of possibile endpoints is the 61.8% fib ext at 150.45, or the 100% fib ext at 152.09. Failure of this structure happens below 147.84.The second scenario is that we are in a triangle top. Again, the morning&#39;s gap down is the X wave. The move up is wave-A, and the move down afterwards is wave-B. This current movement could be wave-C or we are still in wave-B and its subdivided (mean it has 3 waves itself).

Yahoo,2024-08-16,"All waves of a terminal pattern are corrective waves.  They can be subdivided or compacted into complex corrective structures.  Corrective waves are all considered to have 3 waves, even when they are complex.  This is in contrast to motive waves, impulses and terminals, which are considered to have 5 waves, even when extended.  Complex corrective structures can be interlocked by x waves, with each section have 3 waves themselves.  So, you can have a zig-zag pattern followed by a flat and ending with a triangle.The point of this little lesson here is that its notoriously difficult to estimate when a corrective wave is going to end.  All one can use is a general estimate based on the measurements of other waves.  In our current extended wave-5 of the terminal, it is a corrective wave, so it could morph into an additional corrective structure.  In this case, I would surmise that it would be a triangle.  This would give the appearance of a consolidation top.  It looks like its possible the start of a triangle is taking place right now.  The move down in the morning was the x wave.  The small rally upward would be wave-A.  Then waves B, C, D, and E should form.  This is highly speculative, but it could explain why the structure won&#39;t immediately crash.  If a triangle does form at the top, then the terminal pattern ends at wave-E.",Neutral,0,0.9999606609344482,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-15,"For those that have looked at my chart posted today, I will be looking for a fleeting breach of the top of the channel (the downward sloping red line) for an indication to sell.  That doesn&#39;t mean I will sell right at the breach as price could still run some, but it is highly unlikely that price will challenge the 153 near term high set after earnings.  The reason I say this is because the whole corrective wave has been down sloping as indicated by the downward channel.  Therefore, it makes sense if the wave-C rally ends prior to the top.  This could be a decent range - anywhere from 148 to 151.  It could also happen today or tomorrow depending on the strength of this rally.A peak top is not as likely as a consolidation top, but it could happen depending on the bearish catalyst that causes the price to move.",Negative,-1,0.9980721473693848,Main

Her strategic focus on high-performance computing and graphics technologies, along with a commitment to innovation, played a crucial role in this transformation.

Turning around a company like Intel within three years is certainly a challenging task, but not impossible.

If this happens, the wave-C of wave-2 high will be the starting point of wave-3.  That level is 143.25.  That would give 2 targets for wave-3 completion.  First is if wave-1 is the extended wave.  That means wave-3 would have to be around the 61.8% fib ext of wave-1.  This is 116.62.The second target is if wave-3 is the extended wave.  This is the most common form of an impulse.  That would need a minimum target of 161.8% fib ext level of wave-1.  This is 83.60.Remember that the end of wave-C of wave-2 is not confirmed.  So, if the end point is higher than 143.25, you would simply subtract the difference and add it onto the target numbers given for wave-3.Tbh, I would think 83.60 was way too low and was looking for 10 to 15 points higher than that level.

AMD now has 24.1% share, a massive increase. From a revenue share perspective AMD claims to have more than 33% of total dollars spent on server CPUs. That would indicate that the average selling price for EPYC CPUs is higher than that of Intel&#39;s Xeon. In the desktop and mobile processor space, the increases are less dramatic than the server segment, but still show significant gains. From Q1&#39;19 to last quarter, Ryzen has gone from 17.1% to 23% market share in desktop, and from 13.1% to 20.3% in laptops. The revenue share percentage is lower, which tells us here the ASP for Ryzen parts in both segments is lower than Intel Core. Watching the company health of AMD (and Intel) during this time period through the lens of earnings and profitability paints a very clear picture.

Yahoo,2024-08-09,"Hey Doggie Dummmmphuch ...... Just 5 years ago AMD had 2.9% market share in the data center, 18 months after the launch of the first EPYC-branded parts in 2017. AMD now has 24.1% share, a massive increase. From a revenue share perspective AMD claims to have more than 33% of total dollars spent on server CPUs. That would indicate that the average selling price for EPYC CPUs is higher than that of Intel&#39;s Xeon. In the desktop and mobile processor space, the increases are less dramatic than the server segment, but still show significant gains. From Q1&#39;19 to last quarter, Ryzen has gone from 17.1% to 23% market share in desktop, and from 13.1% to 20.3% in laptops. The revenue share percentage is lower, which tells us here the ASP for Ryzen parts in both segments is lower than Intel Core. Watching the company health of AMD (and Intel) during this time period through the lens of earnings and profitability paints a very clear picture. And this data puts some hard market share numbers behind the earnings results.",Positive,1,0.9999500513076782,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-08,"There should be 3 waves up prior to the 139.14 high that makes the top of wave-B of a possible triangle. That would finish wave-D. Then wave-E should form, which would be another corrective wave. This movement is not allowed to break the 128.37 low without invalidating the triangle. Afterwards, there should be a strong impulsive movement to the upside, which should be of similar size to wave-B of the triangle. That would be 17.31 points. Unfortunately, if it is a triangle, I don&#39;t know where wave-E will end. Let&#39;s say, for example, wave-E ends at 132.50.

They also discussed Intel taking an additional 15% stake in OpenAI if it made hardware for the startup at cost price, two people said.Intel  ultimately decided against a deal, partly because then-CEO Bob Swan did not think generative AI models would make it to market in the near future and thus repay the chipmaker&#39;s investment, according to three of the sources, who all requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters.OpenAI was interested in an investment from Intel because it would have reduced their reliance on Nvidia&#39;s chips and allowed the startup to build its own infrastructure, two of the people said.

Yahoo,2024-08-07,"Hey everyone,I wanted to highlight a fantastic opportunity currently emerging with AMD (Advanced Micro Devices). Recently, AMD&#39;s stock price has dipped, which I believe offers a great chance to invest.Latest NewsAMD recently reported strong Q2 2024 earnings, with a revenue of $5.8 billion, marking a 9% year-over-year growth. Despite these positive results, the stock price hasn&#39;t fully reflected this performance, primarily due to broader market volatility‚Äã . AMD expects continued growth, projecting Q3 revenue to be around $6.7 billion, a 16% increase from last year‚Äã. Competitive AdvantageAMD&#39;s main competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are facing significant challenges:Nvidia: Supply chain issues and a cooling crypto market have impacted Nvidia&#39;s sales. While Nvidia remains strong in AI, these issues provide AMD a window to capture more market share‚Äã.Intel: Intel has struggled with production delays and keeping up with AMD&#39;s advancements in CPU technology. AMD&#39;s Ryzen processors continue to outperform Intel&#39;s offerings in both performance and price, which is attracting more consumers and enterprise clients‚ÄãWhy Consider AMD?Innovative Products: AMD&#39;s Ryzen and EPYC processors lead in performance and efficiency. The upcoming AI-focused GPUs also position AMD well in the AI and machine learning markets.Market Growth: AMD&#39;s market share in both CPUs and GPUs is growing. Their strategic partnerships with major players like Microsoft, Sony,",Positive,1,0.9999998807907104,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-07,"AMD has demonstrated robust performance and positive growth projections recently, indicating a strong upward trajectory for the company. For the second quarter of 2024, AMD reported significant year-over-year growth. They achieved a revenue of $5.36 billion, which is a 12% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth is attributed to strong sales across various sectors, including data center, gaming, and embedded systems . AMD&#39;s financial outlook is also optimistic. For the third quarter of 2024, AMD projects revenue to be around $6.7 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase. This positive forecast is supported by the launch of several new products, such as the AMD EPYC 4004 Series processors and the Ryzen 9000 Series processors, which are expected to drive further growth in both enterprise and consumer marketsIn contrast, AMD&#39;s competitors are facing challenges. Intel reported a significant loss of $1.6 billion for the same quarter, along with plans to cut 15% of its workforce in an attempt to manage financial difficulties . NVIDIA, while still a strong player in the GPU market, has also encountered production and supply chain issues that have impacted their performance.Overall, AMD&#39;s strategic investments in new technologies and product lines, combined with the struggles of its main competitors, position the company for continued success and growth in the coming quarters.

Market Confidence:   - Investor Sentiment: A fundamental design flaw could shake investor confidence in Nvidia&#39;s engineering capabilities. This might lead to a more pronounced and prolonged impact on the stock price.   - Customer Trust: Customers, especially in critical sectors like AI and data centers, might lose trust in Nvidia&#39;s ability to deliver reliable products, leading them to consider alternatives.In such a scenario, Nvidia&#39;s response and communication strategy would be crucial.

Yahoo,2024-08-05,"The delay in Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell AI chip production, due to a design flaw discovered late in the development stage, is expected to have several significant impacts on the market and its competitors, including AMD.	1.	Market Opportunity for AMD: Nvidia‚Äôs delay opens a window of opportunity for AMD to capture more market share in the AI and data center sectors. AMD has been advancing its own AI hardware solutions, and this setback for Nvidia could allow AMD to position its products as viable alternatives for companies that cannot wait for the delayed Blackwell chips  .	2.	Revenue and Stock Impact: The delay has already affected Nvidia‚Äôs stock, which saw a notable drop following the announcement. This could also impact Nvidia‚Äôs revenue projections for the fiscal year 2025, as major customers like Microsoft, Google, and Meta have collectively ordered billions of dollars worth of these chips  . In contrast, if AMD can capitalize on this delay, it might see a positive impact on its own stock and revenue.	3.	Strategic Shifts: Companies relying on Nvidia‚Äôs new AI chips for their data centers and AI initiatives might now consider diversifying their hardware suppliers to avoid similar risks in the future.

Unless the market saw stagflation coming (slim chance to none) then this week&#39;s volatility will be forgotten very quickly by August 13But what is important here is, AMD is clearly trading outside its fundamentals. We haven&#39;t seen this price since the release of MI300. When that happened the yearly guidance came with a $2 billion number for it. AMD now has guided for $4.5 billions and added that it will continue to ramp through Q4 for a total of at least $5 billion for the full year in that category. At the same time MI325 is launching and there are rumors about Nvidia having problems with its new architectures. Intel is having reliability issues and the company is a mess and ARM outside of its small niche is nothing special.AMD current share price does not reflect any of that, and i&#39;m certain it will be noticed this second half by big investors.

Yahoo,2024-08-02,"After the horribleness of the past 5 months for AMD (going from $227 to $130) I am surprised at the giddiness of people on the board today. Intel posted terrible earnings, and yes that means AMD is taking some market share from there in data centers, but the big investment firms already knew this. AMD couldn‚Äôt go up on their own when posting earnings this week, and have only gone up (after going straight down for weeks) when Intel posted bad earnings. It‚Äôs not exactly a show of strength for AMD. Trust me, I was happy to see it green this morning, albeit only green $1, especially after first seeing the Dow and Nasdaq getting obliterated, but AMD is a wounded stock right now that has shown zero strength since March. AMD, if stays green on this horrible market day, won today‚Äôs battle, but it has an incredible long and uphill way to win the war and the hearts (and wallets) of the big investment firms. Next week will be the first real test for AMD. If it can keep green and form a base here it will be a cautiously good sign. If it returns to red either later today or most of next week it means there is no basement for AMD and it will continue to drift lower into the Fall. I‚Äôve been long AMD for the last 6 years, ever since I bought it at $10.58. I‚Äôm hoping it goes to $200+ again, but I‚Äôm a realist when it comes to investing.",Positive,1,0.9083818793296814,Main

AMD has more TOPS, more cores, more threads, powerful iGPU, great battery life. It&#39;s hard to see how Intel will sustain its 75% laptop market share over the next year.

The whole market is going to be preparing for the setup of a rally in September if rates are cut, so I suspect this dip is a precursor to the stock making a nice run along with other tech stocks.
