That said, I found IBM to be a kind of cult to many customers in the 80s and 90s, and a few even now. At first, enterprises looked at IBM as the Cadillac of computing. They locked in many places with their mainframe computing the IBM 360 was a staple of business. The biggest places had sales staff with personal relations to the C level of enterprises and sole sourced the equipment. UNIVAC, DEC, Tandem and others to a lesser extent. As the 80s and 90s rolled around, Big Blue kept high prices on their Cadillac and although they rolled out their UNIX AIX and virtually invented the PC, the pricing was high, proprietary in an open source minded world and they lost market share. For one retail company, the Bd of Directors required competitive bidding, and even though any competitor could provide less price and equal or superior function, IBM would be awarded the work because we are used to them. Finally others stopped bidding the pointless exercise it was just to press IBM to keep their pricing down. When the old guard retired, and the enterprise realized the premium they paid for obsolete proprietary systems it was too late. They still used the IBM OS2 PC into the 2000s. They went from sales of billions to bankruptcy. I am convinced their cult belief in IBM and failure to modernize contributed. I did a study for multiple companies that illustrated if they moved off the bloated AIX systems to competitive systems, they would save millions. The paradigm shift always seemed risky, but those that moved were well rewarded. In the last 15 years, where IBM competed against Dell, HPHPE, Fujitsu, Amazon, Microsoft and others for data center refresh, cloud and other updates, they rarely stood the test, unless it was from one of those cultist enterprises who had decided before the bid. They still have a mainframe market it is expensive to migrate but not impossible. Their database product , PC, AIX and others are considered by most to be old iron. Even their cloud is a bit proprietary and pricey iron cloud. Watson has been discussed Their quantum computing research is admirable but given their history of trying to make things proprietary so they can keep price and margin high, I wont expect it to play well with others. It is vaporware somewhat. All said, their sales and margins and employee count are down to 23 of the numbers 10 years ago. The legacy of arrogance. I vote thumbs down. FWIW."

When companies like msft are throwing down 125B on a single datacenter as an example. You just dont do that on hype. This race is critical to corporate survival and global balances of power. Hell even China is creating a regulatory body to ensure we dont end up AIing wwiii with all of it.

Companies will become thousands of times more efficient when all of those millions of dollars they spend on paying employees to readwrite spreadsheets, PDFs, Microsoft Word docs, etc will no longer be necessary since AI will be able to do it in a blink of an eye. This is almost certainly technically possible and will happen to one extent to another. The unknown is to what extent will entrenched processes at these companies slow it down or stop it from happening altogether, but the potential to revolutionize how business is done is equal than or greater what happened during the rise of the dot coms, since that mostly impacted how companies communicated. This has the potential to automate everything else."

When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it.

Ive worked with the secondary one and had great success, so much so Ive hired several of them. We have come in under budget and on time, every time. I dont have the experience working in the hardware arena as others who have commented. Im certainly not in a position to weigh in on cloud implementations, but they have opened up to other cloud support non IBM which was a good move.

If you think you can look at a stock, reverse engineer what the market is expecting for FCF growth or EPS growth baed upon its metrics, and then create a discounted FCF or EPS spreadsheet that is more accurate than the markets prediction, best of luck to you. Id rather go bottom up and make an estimate of FCFEPS growth and just ask the simple question does the current price of the equity make this a good investment without paying any thought to what the market prediction or sentiment is.

That doesnt make railroads a declining industry. The industry is more efficient now than 20 years ago, so train count may be down i dont actually know if they are or not, but this is made up for by longer trains and larger freight cars... if you actually look at the tons of cargo moved by the industry, it will be clear that the industry is doing more work today than it did 20 years ago. They do so more efficiently than they used to and with less personnel. So when referring to railroads as a textbook declining industry.

On top of that it works perfectly with solar fields and wind power fields to store the electric energy as hydrogen if theres an excess of supply.

Any sense for how it might perform with some diversification? For example, do you think the state would perform similarly across the top 3 market caps? Or put another way, if you expand the number of top companies, at what point do returns start to decline? 2? 5? 20? Having built a fairly simply backtest program myself, I understand how challenging what Im asking is to model so no shade of you cant answer. But my sense is that theres potentially significant optimization to be had by expanding the scope of the strategy to capture the rise of the next market cap leader. Im also curious about drawdown and sharpe ratio. You mentioned in the comments about how this is a 30 year strategy. Which I can totally get behind, but Im curious if your back test shows you something that supports that like massive drawdowns during recessions? And if so, does that mean that a layering a market timing model on top would be likely to outperform even further?"

Youre betting that the biggest companies will in relation to the past be bigger than the biggest last companies were.

Currently 3trillion, so all your investing in is hoping the worlds biggest company market cap long term will be much higher, over a 40 year timeline I just cant imagine this being the case with anti monopolistic laws. Currently in the world I cant imagine the governments allowing a company to reach anything more than 10trillion adjusted for inflation without immediate action. So long term inflation adjusted return the max I could see you having is 3x, so on a short timeline I could see this being profitable but long term this cant continue. No company can grow to be infinite in size, which is what this would need to be profitable. So, cool idea, and its interesting to see how the biggest companies have grown in size faster than the overall market for awhile now. But theres a soft cap on size that I dont see this surpassing long term, 10trillion I made up but Id imagine is around accurate, if any of our current companies ever got to 10trill in size theyd likely be split up again."

Not sure what timeframe you were referring to when you said nowadays, but the top 5 biggest companies in the U.S have been juicing outrageous returns for the last 10, 5, and even 1 year ago. So unless you think institutional investors finally caught onto this within the last couple months, theres simply no historical data in support of what youre saying. Why or how this strategy still works, I couldnt tell you. But the data speaks for itself, does it not? I also absolutely think Nvidia will outperform SPX for years to come."

And if it repeats enough times , then you will lose all your gains every time due to buy high sell low and gradually diminish your capital too !! Eg lets say AAPL at 2T today and NVDA at 1.9T. And you start your strategy today buying AAPL. . It goes to 2.1 T tomorrow. Good you gained on paper. And NVDA follows closely and grows to 2T. Good so far. On 3rd day AAPL falls down to 1.9 and NVDA stays at 2T. You sell AAPL and make a loss as 0.1T net loss from day 1 in their MktCap would be a net drop in share price too and hence corresponding loss inyour investment. Now you buy NVDA on day 3 when it is at 2T MktCap. Day 4 it goes up to 2.1T, AAPL catches back to 2T. Day 5 NVDA drips to 1.9T.... you sell NVDA and buy AAPL again making loss.... Rinse and repeat.....you see where this is going.... You will end up buying high ... riding higher but not booking the profit... sliding lower and selling and booking loss. Doesnt have to be just these two tickets jostling for top 1 and 2. It can be any two and your strategy degrades to buy high..sell low !!! You are only accounting for the general scenario that top mkt cap gets created by someone always beating current topper and all toppers always moving up and up. Thats not reality. Toppers rise and fall and their mkt cap is gobbled up by other rising large caps and small caps."

A 30 daily singular drop in APPL will almost certainly trigger a sell down on all algos trying to rebalance their portfolio. This momentum will very likely bleed over to all other stocks, so how do you find the next highest market cap stock when everything is bleeding? Another issue is the effect that Apple has as a tech company. While it does have the largest market cap, the top 7 are almost all tech related except for number 6 at saudi aramco, number 8 at Berkshire, and number 10 at elli lly. A drop in apple is likely to be devastating for tech evaluations. Considering its Apple and the fact that berkshire still has a significant portion of apple as its investment, that would mean that your largest marketcap strategy would end up ocilating between tech, oil, and pharma. I would suggest you not look too far in the past for this strategy because the market was much smaller then, and commisions were insane it wouldnt have been workable trying to do a daily rebalance or even frequent rebalancing. The Roth IRA was only available post 1998, so taxfree trades would not be possible prior. Theres also an issue of liquidity to consider if the strategy was successful. I.e. compounding returns at 22. Assuming you need to rebalance immediately, would dumping millions of dollars worth of shares in a collapsing stock give you the best price at exit and would entering the same cash into another stock give you the best entry. The last point of concern is that declaring the largest market cap as the winner is also only workable if we assume that market caps grow each year. Apple took dominance in 2013 with market cap. In 2015, they had a cap of 643b, in 2016, they still had market dominance, but their cap was 583b. Similarly, in 2018, they had a marketcap of 860b but the following year in 2019, they lost dominance in msft who had a marketcap of 780b whereas they were at 746b. The kicker was that in 2020 apple took back dominance at 1.29T, whereas msft was at 1.2T. Your performance would likely have been better at just buy and hold apple towards the end. Rather than adjusting for every variance. Furthermore, the yearly marketcap seems to ignore a lot of the nuances that happen in the year. Kind of like hindsight trading."

Geometric mean gives you 145 2 3 2.45x per year, which implies you should have 100 2.45 2.45 600 with some rounding error at the end of the two years. Update looking at the raw data given for 19811994, the total return for OPs strategy over those 14 years is 360.7 4.607x. The geometric mean of that is 1.115x, or 11.5 per year, which is less than the posts stated 13.5 annual return for the SP between 19881994. Not sure where that number came from, but if thats the stated number from some authoritative source, then the backtest shows that this strategy loses to the index. If OP calculated that number using arithmetic mean, then wed need to know the actual yearly returns to make a reasonable comparison. Someone else can dig up that data and do that math though."

Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies that growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear."

Jill did not want Harris on the ticket in 2020 because she insulted Joe during her minuscule going nowhere short lived campaign. The only reason Harris got on the ticket is because Jim Clyburn promised Joe the So. Car, primary victory if he put her on the ticket. Clyburn was more concerned about gender and color than ability to do the job. As we have seen for 3-1/2+ years. And 6 months ago the D’s were talking about getting her off the ticket because she is so unpopular and cannot handle tough tasks. Yet now she is the savior of the party and country? I can’t see it. Why won’t she tell us when she knew Biden was unfit for office? Maybe her game plan all along was to let Biden flop the way he did  and then she would take over. Couldn’t win it on her own from even her own party so she had to let Biden fail do she could be coronated. Which she was because the timing was so late. And if you don’t think she was coronated then you did not hear CNN proclaim that if she wasn’t anointed the D party would inplode and lose the African-American bloc that they take for granted. In other words color not qualifications"

So, an IBM investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects IBM the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for IBM. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

Higginbotham \nMajor General, USMC (Ret.)\n  \nFor your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: \n\nKamala Harris&#39; father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris&#39; parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. \n\nThe group&#39;s leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. \n\nFollowing her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown&#39;s political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. \n\nBrown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris&#39; Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris&#39; political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California&#39;s Attorney General.

So, an IBM investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects IBM the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for IBM. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

Now, though, people can buy fractions of a share at the same price as everyone else, so there isn&#39;t a reason to split."

The story states that IBM expects a pre-tax charge of nearly $2.7 billion in the third quarter, related to a transaction involving the transfer of some of its pension plan obligations to a unit of Prudential Financial. Under the deal, nearly $6 billion of IBM&#39;s defined benefit pension obligations will be transferred to Prudential Insurance Company of America. To me, such a move would have NO Financial Accounting treatment unless the past actuaries miscalculated the pension obligation, and they need to fund an additional $2.7B. That said, the story continues that there will be no impact to earnings in Q3 or FY2024...Again, I am confused how a pre-tax charge (if necessary) would not impact earnings. If they correctly had a liability for $6B on their books then a pre-tax charge would not be needed to transfer those obligations to Prudential...but if the pension obligation was not adequately funded, then that would require a hit to earnings to increase the liability on their books. As originally stated, I am confused. Anyone think of a potential reason for a $2.7B charge that has no impact on earnings?"

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like IBM to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax IBM would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of IBM stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on IBM stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on IBM stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."
