Reddit,2024-09-01,"I worked for a competitor of IBM for years, so I acknowledge my bias. That said, I found IBM to be a kind of cult to many customers in the 80s and 90s, and a few even now. At first, enterprises looked at IBM as the Cadillac of computing. They locked in many places with their mainframe computing the IBM 360 was a staple of business. The biggest places had sales staff with personal relations to the C level of enterprises and sole sourced the equipment. UNIVAC, DEC, Tandem and others to a lesser extent. As the 80s and 90s rolled around, Big Blue kept high prices on their Cadillac and although they rolled out their UNIX AIX and virtually invented the PC, the pricing was high, proprietary in an open source minded world and they lost market share. For one retail company, the Bd of Directors required competitive bidding, and even though any competitor could provide less price and equal or superior function, IBM would be awarded the work because we are used to them. Finally others stopped bidding the pointless exercise it was just to press IBM to keep their pricing down. When the old guard retired, and the enterprise realized the premium they paid for obsolete proprietary systems it was too late. They still used the IBM OS2 PC into the 2000s. They went from sales of billions to bankruptcy. I am convinced their cult belief in IBM and failure to modernize contributed. I did a study for multiple companies that illustrated if they moved off the bloated AIX systems to competitive systems, they would save millions. The paradigm shift always seemed risky, but those that moved were well rewarded. In the last 15 years, where IBM competed against Dell, HPHPE, Fujitsu, Amazon, Microsoft and others for data center refresh, cloud and other updates, they rarely stood the test, unless it was from one of those cultist enterprises who had decided before the bid. They still have a mainframe market it is expensive to migrate but not impossible. Their database product , PC, AIX and others are considered by most to be old iron. Even their cloud is a bit proprietary and pricey iron cloud. Watson has been discussed Their quantum computing research is admirable but given their history of trying to make things proprietary so they can keep price and margin high, I wont expect it to play well with others. It is vaporware somewhat. All said, their sales and margins and employee count are down to 23 of the numbers 10 years ago. The legacy of arrogance. I vote thumbs down.

Developers complaining about CentOS not being bug for bug that want to run it in their home lab is silly too.

I am suggesting that the actual results 10 years from now will weigh heavier on the performance over the next 10 years than todays prediction of the results 10 years from now. I am not even sure we are disagreeing with eachother, just describing the same thing in different ways. I think your framing is more abstract and seems to disconnect stocks from the underlying business performance. I philosophically disagree with this disconnect. If you think you can look at a stock, reverse engineer what the market is expecting for FCF growth or EPS growth baed upon its metrics, and then create a discounted FCF or EPS spreadsheet that is more accurate than the markets prediction, best of luck to you. Id rather go bottom up and make an estimate of FCFEPS growth and just ask the simple question does the current price of the equity make this a good investment without paying any thought to what the market prediction or sentiment is.

That doesnt make railroads a declining industry. The industry is more efficient now than 20 years ago, so train count may be down i dont actually know if they are or not, but this is made up for by longer trains and larger freight cars... if you actually look at the tons of cargo moved by the industry, it will be clear that the industry is doing more work today than it did 20 years ago. They do so more efficiently than they used to and with less personnel. So when referring to railroads as a textbook declining industry.

Reddit,2024-08-31,"Bookmarked. Fantastic work, on a simple idea that can actually be traded. No idea why you posted it on WSB but I thank you! Any sense for how it might perform with some diversification? For example, do you think the state would perform similarly across the top 3 market caps? Or put another way, if you expand the number of top companies, at what point do returns start to decline? 2? 5? 20? Having built a fairly simply backtest program myself, I understand how challenging what Im asking is to model so no shade of you cant answer. But my sense is that theres potentially significant optimization to be had by expanding the scope of the strategy to capture the rise of the next market cap leader. Im also curious about drawdown and sharpe ratio. You mentioned in the comments about how this is a 30 year strategy. Which I can totally get behind, but Im curious if your back test shows you something that supports that like massive drawdowns during recessions?

Reddit,2024-08-31,"All this basically is doing is investing in what the worlds biggest company market cap will be. Youre betting that the biggest companies will in relation to the past be bigger than the biggest last companies were. So far this is true, and no company has ever been worth as much as the biggest companies now are. Currently 3trillion, so all your investing in is hoping the worlds biggest company market cap long term will be much higher, over a 40 year timeline I just cant imagine this being the case with anti monopolistic laws. Currently in the world I cant imagine the governments allowing a company to reach anything more than 10trillion adjusted for inflation without immediate action. So long term inflation adjusted return the max I could see you having is 3x, so on a short timeline I could see this being profitable but long term this cant continue. No company can grow to be infinite in size, which is what this would need to be profitable. So, cool idea, and its interesting to see how the biggest companies have grown in size faster than the overall market for awhile now.

Reddit,2024-08-31,"Sounds like the perfect formula to lose money... Going with the highest market cap stock means it may not grow as much as it used to. The room for grow is shrinking more and more. In contrast, a 100x smaller company can grow 100x faster and better. Thus, diversifying your portfolio means that you allowing yourself to grow from multiple sources. Additionally, the largest market cap stock could get hit any minute and drop 30 or more. During market crash some sectors are severely hurt while others maybe just a little. Youre exposing yourself to get smashed any minute, smart! Use logic, not historic numbers as they are not proof for the way forward... Just my opinion.",Negative,-1,0.5791870951652527,Reply

In your case if the highest market cap stock kept going down, new stocks would take its place on the way down but you would keep rebalancing just like someone who is convinced there will be a strong bounce to take price where they feel price for that stock deserves to be.

Reddit,2024-08-31,"If top MC position is achieved not by stock B surpassing stock A gradually, but rather stock A gradually falling down from its top and going below its competitor B. And if it repeats enough times , then you will lose all your gains every time due to buy high sell low and gradually diminish your capital too !! Eg lets say AAPL at 2T today and NVDA at 1.9T. And you start your strategy today buying AAPL. . It goes to 2.1 T tomorrow. Good you gained on paper. And NVDA follows closely and grows to 2T. Good so far. On 3rd day AAPL falls down to 1.9 and NVDA stays at 2T. You sell AAPL and make a loss as 0.1T net loss from day 1 in their MktCap would be a net drop in share price too and hence corresponding loss inyour investment. Now you buy NVDA on day 3 when it is at 2T MktCap. Day 4 it goes up to 2.1T, AAPL catches back to 2T. Day 5 NVDA drips to 1.9T.... you sell NVDA and buy AAPL again making loss.... Rinse and repeat.....you see where this is going.... You will end up buying high ... riding higher but not booking the profit... sliding lower and selling and booking loss. Doesnt have to be just these two tickets jostling for top 1 and 2. It can be any two and your strategy degrades to buy high..sell low !!!

Reddit,2024-08-31,"The trouble with this logic js that Appl already has a significant presence in the SP500. Which means every institution with an algo has APPL in their sight. A 30 daily singular drop in APPL will almost certainly trigger a sell down on all algos trying to rebalance their portfolio. This momentum will very likely bleed over to all other stocks, so how do you find the next highest market cap stock when everything is bleeding? Another issue is the effect that Apple has as a tech company. While it does have the largest market cap, the top 7 are almost all tech related except for number 6 at saudi aramco, number 8 at Berkshire, and number 10 at elli lly. A drop in apple is likely to be devastating for tech evaluations. Considering its Apple and the fact that berkshire still has a significant portion of apple as its investment, that would mean that your largest marketcap strategy would end up ocilating between tech, oil, and pharma. I would suggest you not look too far in the past for this strategy because the market was much smaller then, and commisions were insane it wouldnt have been workable trying to do a daily rebalance or even frequent rebalancing. The Roth IRA was only available post 1998, so taxfree trades would not be possible prior. Theres also an issue of liquidity to consider if the strategy was successful. I.e. compounding returns at 22. Assuming you need to rebalance immediately, would dumping millions of dollars worth of shares in a collapsing stock give you the best price at exit and would entering the same cash into another stock give you the best entry. The last point of concern is that declaring the largest market cap as the winner is also only workable if we assume that market caps grow each year. Apple took dominance in 2013 with market cap. In 2015, they had a cap of 643b, in 2016, they still had market dominance, but their cap was 583b. Similarly, in 2018, they had a marketcap of 860b but the following year in 2019, they lost dominance in msft who had a marketcap of 780b whereas they were at 746b. The kicker was that in 2020 apple took back dominance at 1.29T, whereas msft was at 1.2T. Your performance would likely have been better at just buy and hold apple towards the end. Rather than adjusting for every variance. Furthermore, the yearly marketcap seems to ignore a lot of the nuances that happen in the year.

Geometric mean gives you 145 2 3 2.45x per year, which implies you should have 100 2.45 2.45 600 with some rounding error at the end of the two years.

Reddit,2024-08-31,To put it clear if in 2025 NVDA becomes the highest market cap stock I would sell 100 of Apple and go all in on NVDA as soon as it becomes the highest market cap stock. If at the half of 2025 GOOGL becomes the highest market cap stock I would sell 100 of NVDA and go all in on GOOGL. Whether thats called rebalancing or rotating I think the strategy is pretty clear.

Yahoo,2024-10-29,"There are many issues in this election, but one central issue hasalways been what most significantly divides the Republicans fromthe Democrats. Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies that growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear.",Neutral,0,0.9394843578338623,Main

THIS IS WHO KAMALA HARRIS REALLY IS!

The History of Kamala Harris
by Geoffrey B. Higginbotham 
Major General, USMC (Ret.)
  
For your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: 

Kamala Harris&#39; father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris&#39; parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. 

The group&#39;s leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. 

Following her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown&#39;s political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. 

Brown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris&#39; Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris&#39; political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California&#39;s Attorney General. Willie Brown, Jr. w",Neutral,0,0.9999159574508667,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-08,"Here is a rundown of policy differences. This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like IBM to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax IBM would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of IBM stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on IBM stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on IBM stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal.",Neutral,0,0.9903615713119507,Main
