Yahoo,2024-10-29,"There are many issues in this election, but one central issue hasalways been what most significantly divides the Republicans fromthe Democrats. Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies that growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear.",Neutral,0,0.9394843578338623,Main

Yahoo,2024-10-24,"The ironic part is that most of the TSLA fans don’t understand that Uber will be able to purchase autonomous vehicles from another manufacture rather than TSLA. The technology is being invented as we speak in many companies. In fact multiple articles I have seen mention that FSD for TSLA is a hardware issue as much as a software issue. They think they can solve their hardware issue with a software. Think of a human without eyes. They would need a stick with a rolling ball at the end to navigate to a degree of normalcy. But without eyes it would never truly be a normal process to navigate. Hence sensors are important which TSLA neglects beyond a camera via its vision. Other companies understand the importance of sensors and of course optimizing software that is complemented by hardware…etc. Musks arrogance will eventually affect his business model and so will the competition. There will be other av companies pushing better products, there will be better AI companies pushing better products, and of right now companies like BYD are pushing equivalent if not better ev cars at a lower cost compared to TSLA. Soon to follow more companies in the ev space that will implement better tech. Being politically polarized and being in business only goes so far before the candle burns on both ends.
