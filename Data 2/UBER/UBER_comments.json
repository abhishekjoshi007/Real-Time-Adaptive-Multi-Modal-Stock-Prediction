Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies that growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear."

What we are seeing is a transformative shift in technology from Tesla that will eventually destroy our company absent proactive and competent management. First thing is to lower cost overall and sell or close down Lime scooters as it adds nothing to the company. Next is to repair the relationship with drivers and delivery people. Happy people being the face to interact with customers goes a long way when technology is a threat to labor. Customers love to interact with happy people and get frustrated when technology doesn’t perform as expected which plays to an advantage if done correctly.\n\nThere is time to do this right and no need to panic unless we see that Dara doesn’t recognize the need to change the company and can’t make the transition. Another option is to sell the company as quickly as possible."

Guess what, Hotels and Restaurants will be robocar and will schedule food delivery to its customer thus doordash and ubereats become unnecessary. Grocery store chains could do the same too to deliver grocery. Possibilities are endless. As for as Tesla is concerned, they will cut the price and strangle UBER. Instead Tesla will scalp a lot of advertisement revenues when they have computer screen and captive passenger.  Tesla will earn more than two times thru ad revenue from their car than rideshare revenue.  Think for a while on this."

The technology is being invented as we speak in many companies. In fact multiple articles I have seen mention that FSD for TSLA is a hardware issue as much as a software issue. They think they can solve their hardware issue with a software. Think of a human without eyes. They would need a stick with a rolling ball at the end to navigate to a degree of normalcy. But without eyes it would never truly be a normal process to navigate. Hence sensors are important which TSLA neglects beyond a camera via its vision. Other companies understand the importance of sensors and of course optimizing software that is complemented by hardware…etc. Musks arrogance will eventually affect his business model and so will the competition. There will be other av companies pushing better products, there will be better AI companies pushing better products, and of right now companies like BYD are pushing equivalent if not better ev cars at a lower cost compared to TSLA. Soon to follow more companies in the ev space that will implement better tech. Being politically polarized and being in business only goes so far before the candle burns on both ends. Revenue was down this quarter but that doesn’t matter bc they are profitable this quarter. Hence a 20% increase bc musk knows how to sell the future. Musk is not Tony Stark!"

On the contrary,  Tesla is going to announce their earnings next week and will explain their tesla app which was omitted last week due to medical emergency during we robot presentation.

No intermediary, sharing etc.,   This has a clear price and cost advantage.  Tesla can make money thru advertisement income, rideshare profits, etc. ,   When Tesla enters the market their aim will be to make a difference and to make competition uncomfortable.  Dara sensed it and he fears for it.  All UBER has is the app and labor problem, legal problems and popular app.      Unsupervised FSD  will be available early next year.  Then Model Y and 3 will be a family car that can serve multiple family member.  So the need for UBER and LYFT will be reduced as family no need to call uber to drop off at airport etc.,  In short, there is going to be an impact on income with existing ride platform providers.  Thats the reason, UBER is anxious to find other source of income.  So threat is real. UBER will definitely use its currency - stock.  Most likely it will issue secondary offerings or stock swaps.  Clearly dilution will happen within two months."

They are just few weeks away from releasing it to public.  Secondly, they demonstrated Humanoid robot.  That also walked, behaved like humans.  They also gave the price tag as 20-30K . This would be highly profitable one.   Elon also announced Induction charging.  That is very powerful.  That will make car and humanoid robot charging a breeze.

I transferred 200,000$ from my bank. Vanguard swept 106,000$ to HSBC bank. 7,56 shares of a 1$ per share money market fund at a minimum buy of 3000$ per fund. The shares cost 1$. Vanguard decided and according to my statement that I printed myself on February 12, 2024 had that fund of 7.56 shares \n rolled it into my new IRA Roth account. I&#39;d like to know where 103,000$ went to. I bought and sold the money market fund linked to Seeking Alpha for 1.00$ per share that&#39;s in my Roth IRA account number with Vanguard Investments. Mark Kriesel, Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Arlie Denis and Walt Nejman are my fund managers. Walter Nejman has been managing my assets since 2013.The maximum amount on seeking alpha portfolios is 999,999,999$. So, now Vanguard won&#39;t let me log into any of my 5 accounts until their research team calls me within 3 business days but this was 2 months and 4 calls to ago to Vanguard Investments. Plus my stepdad Bruce Jamison, received marketing materials after I opened my accounts linked to fidelity investments in which my parents also have accounts with Fidelity Investments, Bruce and Glenda Jamison. We share the same address but the post office has been returning all of my mail. This address also raised a red flag with their trust attorneys from using their address on a purchase agreement with Christina Judd-Andrews, platinum realty group, and the deal fell through after fidelity gave me standing instructions authorizing payment to wire money for the house and a 2024 Ford Mustang with KC Metro Ford Company. I provided POF to Christina Judd-Andrews and Erich Phillips who prefilled my Ford Motor credit company application income with all 9&#39;s. I filed a binding arbitration case against Fidelity Investments that is deficient because I don&#39;t have an attorney to help me and they all know this. It&#39;s now been 8 months ago and Aston White, a Vanguard Investments Senior sales consultant not a characteristic of a stock options chain link geo fencing bicycle at all whatsoever to be done with my appointment with Christopher Gibbons who didn&#39;t call me at Walgreens on Roberts in Shawnee KS who scammed me out of my house and the mustang gt too"

I do not own Tesla shares. Some things Tesla has been unable to figure out:How to get the car to do what the navigation system wants. Often my nav voice says &#34;stay in the lane and continue along the highway.&#34; Meanwhile the car tries to exit the highway.The autopark stopped working a few weeks ago. I tried several Tesla advisor solutions and none of them fixed it.The advisor told me to recalibrate the cameras. Once recalibrated the car turned into oncoming traffic in an intersection, and tried to go through a red light into traffic at a second intersection.It is clear FSD is not &#34;learning&#34; anything: the same mistakes are made in the same locations all the time.This is how the car performed the week of their big announcement! It&#39;s almost as if Tesla engineers either don&#39;t drive the cars, don&#39;t care, or don&#39;t have the freedom to improve things.I highly recommend Uber shareholders go to a Tesla store and get a free self drive test for themselves."

So, an UBER investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects UBER the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors. All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for UBER. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects UBER) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of UBER to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

That’s more than 50 percent of their revenue. If anything that has a potential to impact that revenue, Uber will get hit in a big way. Without the institutional pump uber will drop. No more catalyst for growth. All other revenue like delivery and freight are just fringe revenues. Keep in mind Uber freight is still losing money, and the freight brokerage industry is very crowded and competitive. Read CHR, Global Trans, Worldwide Express and more… Not easy for new kid like Uber freight to come in and win it right off the bat. How long has Uber been in freight brokerage business? 5years now if I’m not mistaken; and it’s still losing money."

So, an UBER investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects UBER the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for UBER. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

My usual question is whether they use other apps - many will say they do, for example Bolt. I ask which one they prefer - they will say Uber because of number of people as well as routing and app being superior.Don&#39;t be naive if you think that developing a ride hailing app is easy. Uber acquired many companies and spent millions just on a mapping and routing company. Do you think you can code that in your garage? Don&#39;t be fooled, you won&#39;t run such an infrastructure, it takes time to develop a reliable application like this - trust me.And yes, Uber takes a higher percentage now but many forget that after they have also increased prices so in the end they themselves as well as drivers get more than previously."

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like UBER to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax UBER would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of UBER stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on UBER stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on UBER stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."

Yes, Tesla is the most succesful EV company today but they are not the only one now. They are losing ground actually. If AV ever becomes a reality, which I doubt for the reasons Dara stated, it will not a winner takes all and Uber will be a leader as well (i.e. Uber will probably get the biggest slice of the pie).\n\nGo Uber!"
