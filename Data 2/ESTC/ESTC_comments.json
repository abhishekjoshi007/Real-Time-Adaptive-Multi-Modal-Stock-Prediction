Sure individual and small projects will use Opensearch, because it is easier to get started, but what larger companies will do is what is important. Because it is a fork of a now closed source application, it is going to diverge more and more and not be a one to one replacement as more time goes on. Just because there is competition doesnt mean anything. I am no expert in evaluating database stock, but I know mongodb is publicly traded and they have a lot of document store database competition and they are still doing fine on the market."

Their enterprise customers will have it integrated into many different systems and applications, that any migration will be costly not complicated, just involving many components and possibly gaps in being able to monitor live systems. It appears that they have not properly started to squeeze out the juice and with OpenSearch as a backup option they may have to keep somewhat honest. Also, Amazon was free to create their own version based on the licensing terms that Elastic had selected. I would not call that stealing."

So both are open source options but Elasticsearch has to convince people that their solution is not only better than Opensearch, but that its worth adding a vendor like Elastic to manage their service. With the eroded trust, I would bet against experienced engineering managers in the DevOps space trusting Elastic again. The amount of added work Elastic put on engineering teams to analyze pricing with the changing of licenses really confused the market and a lot of teams opted to switch to Opensearch even though their search as of now is not superior. But Amazon looks committed to improving Opensearch and if I were a betting man, Id bet on Amazons ability to improve and close the gap."

A big issue is to setup alerts you have to write a 200 line json file in a propritary query language, then combine and massage the results with another scripting language to alert you if you have a database running low on storage.

I could be wrong about how well they are doing, but puts are my gut reaction. edit also their security or store procedures suck dick. some old lady was able to buy a pair of shoes using my card. and I had to track her down and have kohls investigate etc. and It was probably just some dumb employee that looked up the wrong name in store and charged it to my card because Sears used to have that issue also."

There is a metric to options, several actually, but one in particular called implied volatility IV for short. Iv plays a factor into options price, and iv is driven by expected events that would drive market price. Earnings is a big one, dates of known contract announcements or company announcements. The market knows all of this and tracks it through IV. The closer you get to these events, the IV will rise, causing the price of an option to rise with it. So by buying options for known events as far away from them as you can stomach, the cheaper you can get that same option for. You have to balance that with how much you think the price will change before that event though. Options are simple yet complicated. So if you buy an option today for earnings tomorrow, it will likely be as expensive as that option gets. Starting the moment the event happens, the iv begins to drop dramatically, lowering the price of the option. This is known as iv crush if you have heard that term used."

But if you look at QoQ, QoQ revenue growth rate has been slowing QoQ revenue growth was 15, which is a lowering percentage that previous QoQ growths not Nvidias fault... its just that the law of large numbers is a bitch. Now that we got that out of the way. Heres some issues Their current margins are about as good as they can get... they can likely only get slightly better by a hair going forward, but there is more room for the downside to get substantially worse. Cyclicality. Any company that sells hardware, where a small concentrated customer base accounts for a large portion of their earnings, is prone to cyclical boom and busts. If Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla decide to not increase their spending on AI GPUs that much more from here or cut back on it, then RIP Nvidia. Following the previous point, why would they possibly not increase their spending that much more or even cut it? Because for the 100200 billion or so being spent on this crap, very little money is being made. OpenAI only made like 3 Billion in annual revenue.

If you had, you would know about their massive licensing issues because of Shay refusing to tighten up licensing and allowing developers to use their program to build a different company and pay nothing to Elastic, as well as the company&#39;s 40% management, and redundant departments such as CA’s(customer success) who are post-sale but yet do nothing and cost the company 10M a year in their departments overhead alone.  Then there is this year’s(24) SKO-sales kick-off in Las Vegas that cost the company over 10M by flying in everyone from across the globe, and next year (25), they are doing the same thing.  They are an expensive program to buy because they are open source, and only 5%of their customers pay for the program.  They do not audit customers using the free program to verify that they are not abusing their licenses.\nFurthermore, four other companies built off of Elastic and then forked the code, e.g., AWS. The reason no one wants to buy the company is the reasons listed above. I sold every bit of stock I had in Elastic and will never repurchase it unless all the top and middle managers, and the board, are gone, whom allows all of this lousy management behavior and license issues to rage on unchecked."
