Yahoo,2024-08-13,"&#34;Our base case remains for a SOX rebound likely in Q4 as seasonal headwinds dissipate,&#34; the analysts wrote.

Which chip stocks are likely to do the best will depend on the performance of the semiconductor sector in general, the bank said. If the SOX does recover in the fourth quarter, BofA recommends the most profitable vendors in their end markets: Nvidia, Broadcom, and KLA.

If volatility continues and demand worsens, the analyst team highlighted names that have traditionally outperformed, including Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, and Broadcom.

And finally, if there is a powerful resurgence, the most volatile chip stocks, including Arm Holdings, Micron Technology, and On Semiconductor, could be winners, the bank said.",Positive,1,0.9728579521179199,Main
