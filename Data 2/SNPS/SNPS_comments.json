Asset prices are still elevated so introducing excess liquidity would be problematic for combating inflation. QE caused wild asset inflation and that changes the dynamic. The Fed needs to get to 2 inflation and holding before it can comfortably cut. We cannot afford loosening monetary policy too early. Fed holds too long and causes a recession, fine.

With a fixed mortgage, if inflation and wages rise 10, its like getting a permanent 10 discount on your single biggest purchase.

Moreover the fed didnt cut too late because they dont care about the stock market they care about employment you needed strong employment BECAUSE raising rates will inevitably affect it like it has now. The fact they could push this hard and get inflation as low as they have is because they waited so long. Dont get me wrong, theres still a lot that can and probably will go wrong, but considering what the fed had to work with partially their own fault tbh, if youre looking to criticize the fed theres plenty there at the end of 2018 but to do what theyve done is a credit to them."

Costco workers get inflation based adjustments as do Starbucks employees, but your average Dollar General, Wendys or Walmart employee is not getting inflation adjusted increases.

You then responded that America has a lot of millionaires to which I stated America has more people in poverty thank millionaires. You stated that 1.6 of people make minimum wage which is a completely inane and stupid metric to go by especially realizing that if you make 14.75 and minimum wage is 14 then you are making over minimum wages and said you gave references that you NEVER provided, so I instead gave a reference on American poverty directly from the American census which supports the statements I have made.
