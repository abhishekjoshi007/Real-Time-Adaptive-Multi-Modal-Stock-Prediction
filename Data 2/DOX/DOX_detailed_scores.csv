Reddit,2024-08-20,"Landing tip over was human error. Dumb one yes but it does not reflect badly on tech. Main selling point is how much cheaper their landers are compared to NASAs. Basically even if 9 of their landers exploded if the 10th made it on the Moon safely NASAs saving money and thats the whole point. Far ahead of commercial rivals and has some juicy contracts. News about the newest one possibly being awarded to them are huge if true. Anyone who knows anything about space missions from an engineering standpoint knows that space is hard and a mission like their IM1 is a resounding success. Tons of things could have gone wrong and didnt. Some highlights are them being the first private company to land on the Moon, have a working 3d printed engine of their own design that worked in space, first liquid methaneoxygen engine to work above LEO and basically their shit works and is very well designed. Their selling point is that theyre cheaper than NASA. Ive said the same shit 100 times on here but regards were like Bbut the lander tipped over. Ok regard. Company is solid, stock was trading for a steal all these months. 5 and below is a good cost average to hold this. It will pump when next launch and if contract is confirmed. Not gonna tell you regards again.",Positive,1,0.7454680800437927,Reply

They have incredible talent and everyone wants to work there. They are already way past the initial startup stages. Their Starlink is literally funding all their experiments and testing. And even if it werent, Big falls over themselves to give Musk money for his projects even if some of them are catastrophies for the banks like Twitter They are winning government contracts and NASA might have to beg them to rescue their astronauts because Boeing is a dumpster fire that will be a huge piece of marketability for spacex.

This is essentially the NSNS contract thats pumping the price now. If anybody needs to communicate with their payload or astronauts on the moon, they can pay to use the satellites there, like a telco service. 3 Theyre building larger moon lander, to deliver up to 1.5 tonnes payload. They also planning to continue developing the VIPER moon rover by NASA and deliver it through this Lander. So future companies and other countries can pay LUNR to deliver vehicles and heavier payloads to the moon. 4 Theyre developing navigation system for US military satellites, they won the contract recently. 5 There is a plan to build a space station to orbit the moon, so we can send astronauts there like a pitstop, before they continue their journey to Mars. Thats one of NASAs long term plan and Artemis project. As of now, they no longer have debts and theyre profitable.

Reddit,2024-08-20,"I did. My guess is the CEO is an alumni for the Daytona Beach Campus. I graduated with a focus in propulsion engineering from the Prescott Arizona campus the one that actually made money while Daytona gets all the nice things. For context my jet propulsion professor literally wrote the book on modern airbreathing jet propulsion. My space propulsion professor was heavily involved with the Air Force during the fun cold war years. My controls professor worked for skunkworks and is why the f35 can do the freaky hovermode shit that it does. Im stuck in IT now and getting by but Ive been told by the old engineer guards that if I could get into a defense firm Id be one of the best engineers around. Life had other opinions sadly. Knowing what I know about LUNR now Im tempted to throw a resume at them for some sort of work and see what happens lol My grad project was hypersonics and I found a way to make airbreathing long range hypersonics viable but impractical. The company we worked with fucked up the test model but the backup model we rigged and used nondimensionalized figures showed the math worked and you can make an airbreathing missile travel at near ICBM range limits as in across the entire United States in 40 minutes in stml using fuel from the cold war all while hitting mach 5 or higher. Current ICBMs cannot do this as they go into space to have their ranges. The tech I made could potentially extend that too. Its just stupidly expensive to do but you can do it and prior to that people thought it was impossible from a heat control standpoint. I figured out how to cool the missile and get more mpg out of the fuel at the same time. You see similar cooling nowadays in the bell nozzles of rockets but I got it to work for aircraft and missile skins. Im sure if anyone knows my project on here I just doxxed myself hard lmao. Not like the shit is secret.

Reddit,2024-08-20,The Raytheon offer was years ago like 2016 and I was unable to get the internship at that time. Id love to work for them again but Im on the other side of the country and kept getting ghosted by defense companies a few years back so I just gave up and went into IT to pay the bills. Outside of the stuff school funded projects as well as the hypersonics capstone I did in college I dont really have much practical engineering which I think was my main issue with getting a job outside of college. I had an interview lined up with Pratt in winter 2021 and then the pandemic happened. I plan to look into going into an engineering role again at some point or more likely Ill try and get into an engineering firm as IT my current experience makes.me very desirable as a sysadmin now and look at hopping into the engineering side after getting passed the external hiring websites. Right now my job is about to have my retirement vest in 2 months so Im not looking to hop anywhere till then. Thats awesome about your current interview process!
