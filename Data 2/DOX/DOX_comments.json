Basically even if 9 of their landers exploded if the 10th made it on the Moon safely NASAs saving money and thats the whole point. Far ahead of commercial rivals and has some juicy contracts. News about the newest one possibly being awarded to them are huge if true. Anyone who knows anything about space missions from an engineering standpoint knows that space is hard and a mission like their IM1 is a resounding success. Tons of things could have gone wrong and didnt. Some highlights are them being the first private company to land on the Moon, have a working 3d printed engine of their own design that worked in space, first liquid methaneoxygen engine to work above LEO and basically their shit works and is very well designed. Their selling point is that theyre cheaper than NASA. Ive said the same shit 100 times on here but regards were like Bbut the lander tipped over. Ok regard. Company is solid, stock was trading for a steal all these months. 5 and below is a good cost average to hold this. It will pump when next launch and if contract is confirmed. Not gonna tell you regards again."

Highly unhinged regards that hate him please feel free to go fap somewhere to the sound of your own voice. This isnt a discussion about Musk. SpaceX is already far head in the game. They have incredible talent and everyone wants to work there. They are already way past the initial startup stages. Their Starlink is literally funding all their experiments and testing. And even if it werent, Big falls over themselves to give Musk money for his projects even if some of them are catastrophies for the banks like Twitter They are winning government contracts and NASA might have to beg them to rescue their astronauts because Boeing is a dumpster fire that will be a huge piece of marketability for spacex. That is my only concern if were talking long term Will the space accommodate more than 1 player maybe? Probably? See Boeing. Just some random thoughts from an imbecile online"

Altemus was put in charge of the forensic examination following the tragedy, assembling the 85,000 pieces of Columbia debris to help determine the cause of the accident. He did his job wellso well that the surviving three shuttles were able to fly without incident for eight and a half more years before their retirement in the summer of 2011.

This is essentially the NSNS contract thats pumping the price now. If anybody needs to communicate with their payload or astronauts on the moon, they can pay to use the satellites there, like a telco service. 3 Theyre building larger moon lander, to deliver up to 1.5 tonnes payload. They also planning to continue developing the VIPER moon rover by NASA and deliver it through this Lander. So future companies and other countries can pay LUNR to deliver vehicles and heavier payloads to the moon. 4 Theyre developing navigation system for US military satellites, they won the contract recently. 5 There is a plan to build a space station to orbit the moon, so we can send astronauts there like a pitstop, before they continue their journey to Mars. Thats one of NASAs long term plan and Artemis project. As of now, they no longer have debts and theyre profitable.

I graduated with a focus in propulsion engineering from the Prescott Arizona campus the one that actually made money while Daytona gets all the nice things. For context my jet propulsion professor literally wrote the book on modern airbreathing jet propulsion. My space propulsion professor was heavily involved with the Air Force during the fun cold war years. My controls professor worked for skunkworks and is why the f35 can do the freaky hovermode shit that it does. Im stuck in IT now and getting by but Ive been told by the old engineer guards that if I could get into a defense firm Id be one of the best engineers around. Life had other opinions sadly. Knowing what I know about LUNR now Im tempted to throw a resume at them for some sort of work and see what happens lol My grad project was hypersonics and I found a way to make airbreathing long range hypersonics viable but impractical. The company we worked with fucked up the test model but the backup model we rigged and used nondimensionalized figures showed the math worked and you can make an airbreathing missile travel at near ICBM range limits as in across the entire United States in 40 minutes in stml using fuel from the cold war all while hitting mach 5 or higher. Current ICBMs cannot do this as they go into space to have their ranges. The tech I made could potentially extend that too. Its just stupidly expensive to do but you can do it and prior to that people thought it was impossible from a heat control standpoint. I figured out how to cool the missile and get more mpg out of the fuel at the same time. You see similar cooling nowadays in the bell nozzles of rockets but I got it to work for aircraft and missile skins. Im sure if anyone knows my project on here I just doxxed myself hard lmao. Not like the shit is secret. Raytheon wanted to get me to do intern work with them on their recently announced supersonic glide vehicles since I made a design that was man carryable, and only needed an air balloon to get enough speed to blow up a building on kinetic impact. Cheaper than a hellfire too"
