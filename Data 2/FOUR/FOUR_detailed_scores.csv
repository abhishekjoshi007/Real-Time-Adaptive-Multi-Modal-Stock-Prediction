Its low price sushi, although there is no such thing as low price here in the USA... but in general, 4 for fresh nigiri is cheap here in the USA. Even Costcos crappy sushi is more expensive per nigiri and thats total crap by comparison. Cold stale rice with no vinegar. I dont even know how Costco carries it... Sushi is a very difficult cuisine. You cant just decide to offer it and expect to do well. In other words, KRUS has no competition right now except ma and pa and they cant scale like KRUS. The runway is theirs. They may never grow to the size of of 1000 units but they can easily hit 300 without any slow down and they havent even cracked 70 yet.

Reddit,2024-10-24,"No, they arent. Pensions are far more efficient than 401ks, delivering the same payout in retirement with only 50 of the input cost. There are three big reasons for this 1 Actuarial savings. With a 401k, you must save enough money and limit withdrawal rates to a level low enough to last for your maximum potential lifespan. Defined benefit pensions only need to save enough for the average workers lifespan, because some people will die earlier and others will die later. This reduces the cost of a given future income by 30. 2 Reduced management fees, which save approximately 10. 3 With a 401k, your asset allocation must vary across your lifespan. When youre young you can maintain 100 equities, giving a high rate of return. However, you have virtually no money invested. Conversely, as you get older, you must add bonds to account for sequence of return risk, reducing your average rate of return during the time when you have the largest account balance. Pension funds can maintain an optimal asset allocation at all times, increasing the lifetime rate of return.",Positive,1,0.8071578145027161,Reply

The odds of it being correlated is extremely unlikely, and proving it seems even less likely. Sanofi gets licensure to Novavax technology for vaccine development. They have 3 mRNA vaccines in P1, 5 in P2, and 4 in P3. Any of these could be reformulated with matrix m to potentially increase efficacy and profit margin, and matrix particularly allows less material to be used with greater efficacy.

I have asked them multiple times by email to clarify that this isnt the same vaccine they announced and abandoned 1520 years ago and what their new approach is. After all this cant be about the Sanofi vaccine in combination with MatrixM, because that wouldnt require any work. But they never responded. They are probably too busy firing scientists and making plans for the new pipeline. Novavax continues to optimize preclinical candidates, including a new approach to H5N1 bird flu vaccination. Novavax also confirmed earlier in the month that its currently conducting a preclinical study for an avian flu shot Novavax, which has been conducting preclinical tests on vaccines targeting three different H5N1 strains, rose 5.3 per cent to 15.70.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"To me the real challenges are both legal and operational. So for fun, lets assume all Elons claims come true. 2030k in 2026 with FSD without lidar just for the sake of argument. Nobody has clearance to run fully autonomous cars on the road. There are some companies who have some clearance to run some cars and they are reporting back good data. But thats all based on lidar systems, not just camera based. The roll out will have to take this in consideration and this is not a technological step but a governance one. This will take considerable time. Beyond that, these cars will need charging, which might be inductive sure but that still needs infrastructure which needs to be built out. Since there is no single station built anywhere. Then you have to think about the hygiene within the car, both in terms of actual hygiene, but also gravity and misuse by the public. This will need operational staff too. This is where the waymo roll out is a lot more sensible, especially the partnership with a company like Uber who does have infrastructure and operational staff in most mayor cities or the capacity to scale. And even if you were to fix all of those issues youd also be activating a lot of latent demand for mobility, there is a reason you need a license to run a taxi in NYC otherwise it would be even more gridlocked than it is today. Now add into that mix every subway rider who now wants to take a cybertaxi. Walking would be faster at that rate. And that is just existing ridership, latent demand is real and will affect cities. This future increases call for regulation. The vision is clear and yes long term this will be how mobility will be operated. Along side many other options like autonomous busses, streetcars, trains and subways. Who knows if you are looking long term maybe even drones with more energy density from advanced solid state batteries.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"This is likely to get downvoted heavily. But I actually do not think Tesla is serious about a robot taxi service. I have not seen any investment specifically for such a service beyond the event. The cars are really for selling at some point in the future like they now have the S, X, 3, Y and Cybertruck. If they were serious about a robot taxi service they would be investing into getting permits, starting a trial, etc. All we have so far is them driving around in a very controlled environment without a driver. Everywhere else they have a driver as is required with FSD. Google also did a show like what Tesla did. But the difference is that Google did it just coming up on 10 years ago. It was done in early 2015. So basically a decade earlier. But also Google did their actually on public roads. Not a movie set. So a much more impressive demo. The problem for Tesla is that actually rolling out a robot taxi service would take massive investment. You need all kinds of infrastructure to support. So if there was not Waymo then that would probably not be a difficult decision. But there is Waymo. Who has now implemented successfully in three cities and are adding 2 more, Austin and Atlanta. It will be very difficult for Tesla to now compete. It would even be if Tesla was ready to start trials today. But we are now talking years away for them to do the car. There is so much going against the second mover in this space. There is a significant and natural regulatory capture aspect. Whoever comes after Waymo is going to have a very difficult time not getting into hot water with the permit granters. Because you are constantly going to get compared to Waymo who has just run a very clean operation. Anyone new is going to have some trouble and when compared to Waymo they are not going to fare well.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"To me, the real challenges lie in both legal and practical matters. For the sake of argument, lets assume all the grand claims about these automobiles are true. Perhaps they will cost 500 or less by 1926 and can drive further than a horse can walk. Even if that happens, no one has the legal clearance to run cars on the roads. A few companies have permission to test some motor cars, and theyre reporting back decent results. But those are using advanced techniques like trained drivers, etc. The rollout of these cars will depend heavily on new laws and regulations, not just the technology itself. That will take time. Beyond that, these vehicles will need fuel, and sure, there might be some ideas about gas stations, but that still requires infrastructure, and not a single refueling station is built for such a system. Then theres the issue of smog from the cars... This is where I believe the more sensible approach lies with something like the horse and carrage companies we already have, who are working with horsedrawn carriages and have the infrastructure and manpower to operate in most major cities or at least scale to do so. Even if you solve all these problems, youll still be unlocking a lot of pentup demand for transportation. Theres a reason you need a license to operate a hackney carriage in New York Cityif anyone could run one, the streets would be even more gridlocked than they already are. Now imagine every streetcar rider deciding they want to take an automobile instead. You might be better off walking at that rate. And thats just with current horse ridershiptheres always latent demand, which will impact cities. This future will surely require new regulations. The vision is clear, and yes, in the long term, this is how transportation might operate, alongside other methods like railways, and maybe even air travel one day.

Engineers are freaking awesome! And I do fully agree with you that the us in particular is lacking adequate infrastructure for its mobility needs, which leads to the just one more lane mentally we see in places like LA or Austin. The challenge is infrastructure doesnt get built overnight, it takes decades to make a dent and this takes vision and commitment, which is not something most politicians can afford, its just the nature of the way we distributed power. This applies widely even beyond the US. It truly baffles me to hear people say that public transport needs to turn a profit or that its bad that it subsidized. We dont have that requirement for roads and per mile most public transport is cheaper, more efficient, less polluting and most of all safer too. Yes I am a massive not just bikes fan. Now I will admit traveling by car is more comfortable, often faster and there are places, especially urban where public transport makes a lot less sense. But compare the public transport network of any major us city besides NYC to other metropolitan areas in the world like Paris, London or Tokio and it becomes laughable. But to come back to the valid point you are making, when I talk about robotaxis I see them as public transport, I think its Ludacris to have a 2 seater robotaxi. Autonomous busses and people movers can create networks which the us is in dire need of for a reduced cost, potentially to the point that in more urban areas there is an opportunity for profit.

The same problem exists, people need to go from point a to point b. The economics of significantly improving mass transit dont make sense for a company to take on by itself. Thats what our government is supposed to do, and has a failed, which is either a reflection of the voting base itself andor lobbyist. I would love to have better mass transit. I live in San Francisco, a city that has waymos, Bart subway and Muni. The cost it would take to improve our public transit to compete with European cities would be tens of billions. I was blown away by the Copenhagen public transit system. SF is relatively denser than most of America, in order for mass transit to work efficiently we would have to build even denser housing. To say its a solution to a problem that doesnt exist is a red herring. Transportation is a problem. Autonomous vehicles help solve that problem, and since they are electric arent as bad on the environment. And autonomous vehicles could be a viable option to reduce car ownership, which in turn would reduce the need to plan around cars, opening up denser housing and maybe we as voters would vote for mass transit? Its entirely feasible that in the next decade or two that waymos could operate on the vast majority of roads in America. Imagine a world where instead of paying 300500 a month on a car, you subscribe to an autonomous network for 300, that gives you set a number of miles...like the old phone plans. This is more feasible than a human driver doing this all the time because AVs dont need to sleep. They dont get tired on the road. They dont get road rage. This would be significantly better for us because we dont have to worry about to parking the cars or maintaining them. Youre looking at it as we need mass transit to reduce car reliance.

There can be separate vehicles for the 10, but the idea about 2 seater is the compounding gains from reduced weight in terms of how much electric powered cars can go. Reduced weight reduced electric usage reduced requirements for battery size even further reduced electric usage. Ideal would be a mix with larger proportion of 2 seaters and some larger seaters mixed in there. Back of the napkin calculations would come to cost savings of around 25 30, putting together production costs and energy cost. So a ride that with 4 seater would cost otherwise 10, it would cost 7 7.50 with 2 seater if theres 2 or fewer people.",Positive,1,0.9783570170402527,Reply

This would bring us to the price point at a certain price level, it would be better and smarter to rely on services vs cars. And Tesla would need to be cheaper than taxis and Ubers to get this market. Now you could argue, it will not replace a self owned car for 100.

The better than expected jobs report since shouldnt change their course of action as long as inflation continues to come in in line with expectations.

Their dot plots were done before the strong data. That means they thought 5.5 was obviously way too high to warrant starting with 50 bps cut, but then 5.0 is somehow not that high to even warrant a cut? When youre talking about Fed medians, Im assuming youre talking about all officials. Among 2024 voters and 9 people who put in 3 cuts in 2024, Bowman, Bostic, Barkin, and Waller wouldve all preferred a 25 bps cut. Hammack was a voter, but no clear side from her yet. I was talking about Sept dot plot, not June dot plot. I dont know why youre bringing up June dot plot to describe voters in Sept. Also, that dovehawk spectrum is pretty wrong by the way. Kashkari has turned back into a dove already and thinks the risk shifts more towards weaker labor market. Barkin is the third most hawkish Fed member behind Schmid. Dalys a dove, and Wallers much more hawkish than Powell, who is now pretty much a dove. In fact, Waller probably sets the tone for where the hawks stand, which was why the Sept vote was very surprising because the Friday before the blackout period, Waller came out and didnt give forward guidance for a 50 bps cut, which caused even the most dovish forecasters like Citi to move to predicting 25bps cut.

Reddit,2024-10-09,"lol, Kashkari changing his view on cuts literally in just the last month or two doesnt make him a dove...hes been plastered on the moar hikes bandwagon practically all year hes on the record as saying rate hikes arent off the table as late as May 28th If anything, the fact hes acquiesced to cuts and significant ones at that is more of a sign of how much sentiment has shifted, even among the hawks. Whereas nothing is perfect, I found that cheat sheet to be relatively accurate. Daly isnt a dove...in fact, Ive seen Daly go back and forth quite a few times in sentiment, very similar to Powell and Williams, both of whom are fairly rated in the middleish. They all tend to be reactive more than proactive. The fact you call Powell a dove is nuts. If he was a dove, they would have cut a quarter point in June when they should have. Hes _very_ clearly more weighted towards overvaluing the inflation side of their dualmandate. Waller may be a _touch_ too dovish on the chart, but marginally...hes nowhere near the Kashkari range. Hes probably somewhere between Barkin and Bostic. At that rate, youre really splitting hairs though. For 2025, I still disagree. Losing Daly, who is close to the middle, is not the same as gaining Goolsbee. When it comes down to it, I kinda view it like the Supreme Court...BowmanBosticSchmidKashkari are your AlitoThomases...you know what theyre going to do before they vote. Kugler, Barr, Goolsbee, and Cook are like Sotomayor...you know what theyre going to do before they vote.

Reddit,2024-10-09,"Did anyone else on the Fed say the risk is more weighted towards weaker labor market? None. Therefore, Kashkari is NOW a dove. I dont care what he said 12 months ago, because were talking about the present. If you want to talk about the past, why stop at 12 months. Go back 6 years, when he was the most dovish member. If you listened to Daly talk at all, youd see she clearly shifts more towards protecting the labor market. Shes a labor economist by training, and frequently talks about the hardship of lower class workers. Of course shes gonna lean towards protecting the labor market, which hits the lower class the most in recessions. Powell is CLEARLY a dove now. Look at his Jackson Hole speech. He was obviously pressuring the hawks in the committee towards a cut. Whenever Powell speaks at the FOMC or Jackson Hole, he has to represent the whole community, not just his own opinion. The fact that he declared definitively the Fed was cutting when several hawks were still on the fence, and then chimed in his own dovish opinions on a platform where he was representing the whole committee hawks and doves showed he was trying to steer the committee towards him. Even in July FOMC before the weak job report, you could see he was leaning towards a cut when the labor market was supposedly super strong, but couldnt convince the committee to get on board. Hes been itching to cut since July, easily just a notch below Goolsbee, and thats only because he has to represent the whole committee. Barkin is just as hawkish as Kashkari 6 months ago. He rarely talks about inflation progress, and is always cautious that businesses have shifted towards raising price first mindset. He doesnt even want to go back to neutral rate yet, which means he still thinks the risk leans towards higher inflation. In fact, they were frequently among the most hawkish dot plots along with BullardMesterBowman, and BosticWaller 1 notch below them. Waller was always saying the labor market is strong and theres no rush to cut in all his speech. No one knows what Barr will do. Barr doesnt talk about the economy much. He pretty much just follows Powell.",Neutral,0,0.9959667921066284,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-09,"You have a point on Kashkari at the 6 year window. That was a radical change. Although I still dont believe hes currently a dove. Or at least we dont have enough data to show that. Like I said, he was talking a hawkish game literally 4 months ago and has been one of the most hawkish Fed officials for several years running now. I mean hes pretty much a hawkish meme on the internet with his crazy eyes. Is it possible his view radically shifted again? Absolutely. But I dont believe it yet. On Powell, I still disagree. His talk didnt talk dovish until after the June jobs report, when it became club over the head obvious to everyone Kashkari included. Powell talked very hawkish up to the point, including in his response to questions at the FOMC. In general, looking back at the FOMC meets, he would very easily dismiss weakening labor market news and trends and be very quick to latch onto even a subtle shift in inflation numbers. Like inflation would have 1 month of surprise upsurge and he would insist they need 3 more months of good inflation data before they can think of cutting. And if another upsurge happened in those 3 months, hed reset the 3 month counter. That went on nearly all year, fully ignorant of the trendline. And the inverse was true of jobs. Like you would see this clear upward trend in unemployment that he would fully ignore, pointing to the fact it went down in like a single recent report. I could very easily see Powell looking at the recent 254k jobs report, freaking out, and returning to his hawkish talk needing more data, having plenty of time to wait, pausing w tools to respond. Thats his MO...overreact to a single recent event and be slow to react to broader trends. At any rate, agree to disagree on this one, but you have fair points.",Neutral,0,0.9959670305252075,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-09,"You have pretty outdated views. Powell had shifted away from his hawkish stance for almost a year now. He chose to signal a rate cut in Dec 2023 when financial condition was already overpricing Fed cuts, and after financial condition had loosened a lot a month prior. He chose to dismiss the hot inflation prints in Q1 2024 as noise until the third hot print where he basically couldnt dismiss it anymore. He acknowledged that therere seasonal factors that artificially bring up inflation early in the year and bring down inflation later in the year. If this is what he believes in, he should slowly cut until early next year and observe what inflation does, not start with 50 bps cut. Theres also the new president next year which would be inflationary no matter what, so that further adds reasons to go slow and wait until next year. Unemployment rate going up is due to more labor supply, not layoffs. Whats the rush in that? Unemployment was going up for months while we continued to add 250k jobs, and everyone was saying nothing but positive things about the economy. We only shifted down to 150k jobs for 2 months and now suddenly the labor market is weak? Consumer spending is strong, job confidence is strong. If there was any real risk of recession, economists and the market wouldve already flagged that, but none have so far. Btw, a dove focuses more on the job mandate, and a hawk focuses more on the inflation mandate. It doesnt matter what the reason for their focuses are, but Kashkari is now a much bigger dove than the rest when the rest of them saw the same data. Same with Powell.",Neutral,0,0.9005052447319031,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-09,"Ive literally watched every FOMC meeting like a hawk. Shift is not something Id attribute to Powell. If anything, the story of 2024 is that he says the same thing, reiterating himself again and again and again. Hell, the whole reason the stock market would tank after each Fed meeting is because people kept expecting the dovish cuts are coming soon convo and hed stubbornly stick to hawkish dont even think about it, we need more data, promptly causing a rapid sell off in equities. The market was overpricing cuts because they literally were ignoring the words coming out of his mouth. Even as late as the June meeting, it was hawkish words To quote the above link For a seventh straight meeting, the FOMCs statement repeats language stating that the committee doesnt expect to cut rates until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2. Powell doubled down on the dot plots hawkish tone at the press conference, proclaiming, If the economy remains solid and inflation continues to persist, we are prepared to maintain the current rate level. If the labor market were to weaken significantly...we are prepared to respond Thats literally the exact same stance he was running for 7 meetings prior hold rates steady, wait for data. There wasnt a hint of dovishness there. He doesnt say anything like were preparing to cut soon. That didnt come until Jackson Hole following the dismal June jobs report. On the labor market, it is weak, but macroeconomics dont turn on a dime. Show me any time in history on this chart where the unemployment rate starts turning upward and then stops or declines after only three quarters of a percentage point You wont find it. Sentiment and trends are long term glacierlike snowballing effects. Its why you cant see a recession until youre in it. Because if all youre focusing on is present data whilst ignoring a clearly developing trend, youll never see it. Sure, the labor market is fine now. But thats not what Im concerned about. Do you ever wonder why the Fed is always behind the curve and seems to miss the boat all the time? Always reacting and cleaning up messes after economy implosions instead of being ahead of the ball? This is why. Theyre going to see that most recent 254k jobs report and go look, everything is fine, we can maintain the rate. Then the next month the jobs report is going to be adjusted or abysmal, and once again theyll be behind the curve. Honestly, for entities that constantly claim to care about longterm data, Im shocked at how shortterm thinking they truly are. Inflation has been on a clear downward trend since at least August 2023, and only now they start releasing the screws? When were only a half percent above 2 CPE?",Neutral,0,0.9839789569377899,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-09,"your quote is not a hawkish quote. It is a neutral quote. A hawkish quote would not include the latter part where they are prepared to respond swiftly to deteriorating labor market, which is what Powell did in 2023, not mentioning any concern for the labor market. Please interpret the quote yourself instead of relying on someone else to do it for you. The FOMC statement is crafted by the WHOLE committee, not Powell alone. The dot plot was hawkish in June, but Powell was not. Powell only has control in the FOMC QA. If you think dovish signal can only come from were preparing to cut soon, youre not following the FOMC that closely. Powell can signal dovishness by what he choose to say or not say, what he chooses to emphasize. For example, therere 2 conditions for him to cut rates falling inflation, deterioration of labor market. Only 1 condition for him to HOLD rates, not even hike higher inflation. That right there shows a HUGE dovish bias, and he made this shift late last year. This is evident in the financial condition, which was the tightest late last year and have eased down to summer 2022 levels. Sp500 rallied 300 points after June FOMC. Not sure where the selloffs youre talking about are. The only time the market sold off this year due to hawkish Fed was in April after 3 consecutive bad inflation prints, but not during FOMC. Any instance when unemployment turns upwards and then stop? Summer 2023. Remember when all the recession forecasts became soft landing forecast? Or you already forgot. initial claims also spiked back then too. But why does it matter. Unemployment rate is spiking due to labor supply, not firing. Show me any instance in the past when unemployment rate spiked up due to labor supply.",Neutral,0,0.9953182339668274,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-09,"That quote is only a neutral quote if were at a neutral rate. Powell himself claims the rate we were at prior to the recent half point cut was a significantly restrictive rate, with the rate were at now still restrictive even after the cut. When we get to 2 inflation, we should ideally at that point be at a neutral rate. Because of that reason, the quote is hawkish. Its ignoring the data, ignoring the trend, and preparing forassuming the worst i.e. inflation to reinflate. A neutral stance would have reacted to falling inflation by slowly reducing the rate restriction so that we would be near a neutral rate near the same time we hit 2 inflation. That is not going to happen. Were going to hit 2 CPE within months and wont be anywhere near a neutral rate until sometime in 2026 per even the latest dot plot. Unemployment didnt go anywhere in summer of 2023. That entire time unemployment was in the 3.4 3.8 range and effectively moved sideways. Mainly because we had slack from tons of job openings to absorb any declines in business activity. That buffer has all but evaporated at this point Future weakening in the job market wont come from unfilled openings, itll come from actual filled job positions. As can be seen from the upwardly trending unemployed per job opening chart I also dont know why you seem to believe that the only reason unemployment is trending up is due to supply. There are many sectors in our economy that are laying off people left and right. Tech is one of the big ones Other industries are slow to follow because companies are still afraid to release their workers after the acute shortage they just went through in the proceeding years. So they are choosing to hold workers at a loss rather than release them. At some point those fears will subside. Consumer spending has been declining through all of 2024 and people are becoming increasingly selective about where they spend their money, particularly on big ticket items. Hell, the automobile market all but collapsed people just arent buying cars anymore. Until I see any of these trends break, Im going to assume theyre going to continue.

Thats really my big complaint the developers of apps arent supporting the devices, which means they become niche and people would rather have their smartphones.

The FAA needs to create public disclosures of their safety process at Boeing. Whitaker, who has said the agency has permanently boosted the use of inperson inspectors at Boeing, in January barred the planemaker from boosting production of its bestselling 737 MAX until it makes quality and safety improvements. I take this statement as we hired one extra guy. The FAA is monitoring the health of Boeings production and quality system by reviewing key performance indicators that provide realtime visibility into the production system with specific control limits that will trigger corrective action if needed, Whitaker said. Id be very interested in seeing these KPIs. Whitaker said the FAA is reevaluating our current safety management initiatives and establishing a strategy to revamp our agencywide safety management program. He said the FAA is also looks at ways to use the vast internal and external data resources to become more predictive in identifying risks across the aviation system.

Basically, if Im planning on job hopping, retiring, or changing careers in the next year or so, 6k now is better than a wage increase or other benefit that doesnt kick in until well after Im gone or takes years to reap the full benefit. Logically it fails on a multitude of levels because better pay at one large manufacturer often has the effect of raising wages elsewhere because other companies have go compete for workers. So if youre going to be in the same field, in the long run it helps wages for everyone indirectly and could reap well more than 6k equivalent.

Reddit,2024-09-23,"Because 401ks require much higher contributions for an equivalent payout about twice as much actually. Defined benefit pensions are a much better deal from a financial perspective. Theres a number of reasons for this. 401ks have higher management fees, for one. For another, workers with a 401k must save enough and withdraw at a low enough rate to stretch their savings until they die, whereas pension funds only need to save enough for the average workers lifespan. Finally, pension funds can have an optimal asset allocation at all times, whereas individual accounts must be shifted from highreturn stocks to lowreturn bonds to avoid the risk of a market crash. Thus, you have a high rate of return when you are young and have virtually no money in the account, and a low rate of return when you are old and you have a lot of money in the account, which cuts the potential returns massively.",Positive,1,0.7805275321006775,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-23,"Machinists have been circulating a leaked memo showing that management is trying to get members of the engineers union to do strikers work, offering extra pay. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace SPEEA, which has 16,000 members at Boeing in the Puget Sound area, has been telling members that they dont have to volunteer for any Machinist work. The SPEEA contract does not allow them to refuse to work during a Machinists strike. Our message to members is absolutely do not volunteer to do any work normally done by IAM members, Dimas said on the unions website. If directly ordered, the union said, Comply, but question your manager about training and safety requirements, and immediately contact your Council Rep. Council reps are the equivalent of stewards. A lot of work done by Machinists members requires specific certifications that SPEEA members may not have. Meanwhile, SPEEA union president John Dimas and other SPEEA members greeted Machinists as they exited the plants, said Michael Berryhill, a SPEEA council rep who works in a product development facility near the Everett factory. Picketing Machinists told Berryhill that before the walkout they saw SPEEA members specifically decline to do Machinist work, listing a myriad of reasons why they couldnt do the work, citing certifications, citing safety and quality issues, and flat out refusing to write off of quality inspections and stuff like that, said Berryhill. SPEEA encouraged members visit picket lines, bring food and firewood, donate, and put up signs in the workplace supporting the strike. Show vocal and visible support for our brothers and sisters in the IAM, said Dimas.

Reddit,2024-09-23,"So, my comment is saying that competition is coming, and that fits with your 10year narrative. The C390 is a larger aircraft and shows Embraer is up to the task of making those types of aircraft. There was speculation that they might make a commercial variant of it after all or that it is a kind of demonstrator to signal that they can do it. The C919 doesnt need to compete in the US. It just needs to compete as these are global business ventures. Despite US tensions and relations with China, if several airlines buy the C919, then there is certainly a reality where it gets approved for international flights into and out of the US, but is not an option to be domestically purchased. The C919 was also started in like 2008? The project is pretty mature at around 15 years old, and China is flying it domestically for flights now. It is currently working to get EU certification right now. As an American, I certainly wish that the US market was the one fostering this competition, but Boeing has quite effectively destroyed the nations market for commercial aircraft through mergers, acquisitions, or just plane old compeition with Lockheed. The reality is that with how stock and shareholding works, Boeing is mandated and forced to gobble everything up. They play that side of the game well. Too bad they cant make their own products, so they wind of having a glass house supported by government contracts and a shaky foundation.

Boeings issues are pretty well documented, and the crosshairs are firmly on executives asking middle management to do cost saving and cost cutting. All this resulted in a less trained up, less knowledgeable workforce building the planes with a few old hats running around who would know basically everything. The Alaska blowout was cause because the 20year veteran employee, who was the only person in the plant properly trained and qualified to install that door, was on vacation. They sold Wichita to break their workforce, they built the Carolina plant to hire cheaper labor without a union, and they even contracted outside vendors with deals that have caused companies to go under, but only after they cheapen the parts and processes over a period of years.

Reddit,2024-09-20,"I think anyone looking at today may as well not even comment. The whole point behind this is figuring out where were going to be in 6 to 12 months. If the economy was going to stay exactly like it is. Of course theres no reason to cut. Thats not how it works. The economy is very dynamic and the general direction it is heading is absolutely slowing. Its worth noting that its going to continue to slow for the next 200 basis points or so. In my opinion that gives a upside risk scenario to the Fed having to cut 75, do emergency 50s, this all took place in 2001 mind you. Things slowed a lot more than they expected after all those hikes and we just had a huge series of hikes. The idea is to prevent unemployment from going meaningfully higher. Promote business confidence. The election will soon be behind us and we will know what policy will have. I would not blame someone for being 100 in TLT or a mix of TLT and some of the shorter dated bonds if they were extremely risk adverse. I think the risk of the economy slowing more than expected is far far higher than inflation reaccelerating. 50 was absolutely the right move but more importantly, what are they going to do moving forward? If theres any hint of things slowing more than expected they have to keep cutting 50 and get us down to about three and a half percent by spring to summer of next year.

A lot of that stock money will flood into bonds so youll see bonds rallying every day while stocks sell off. This most recent predicament we had stocks and bonds sold off together which was very unusual. It would not be that unusual to see stocks and bonds rally together on the opposite side which we are now moving into.

I know I used to work at a company that had some of those bs listings and were basically using them for a bait and switch to get more people to interview for the high turnover jobs. They had I think 5 warehouse job listings and were actually only hiring for 1 of them for months at a time. They would always tell people the other jobs had been recently filled, but the truth was that turnover was high in one job and rather than fixing the issues they preferred to just keep hiring and having people leave. Now I do think the retail around office buildings and commuter corridors is suffering. I do think a lot of those jobs are in danger of going away. I do think that a portion of those jobs will simply relocate to smaller operations in suburbia, but plenty of people wont enjoy how that plays out for their personal situation.

On the engineering side the US aerospace engineering ranks are gutted compared to 50 years ago. Fewer students go into it because 1a the contractionconsolidation in the US aerospace industry post Cold War impacted jobs and career opportunities 1b salty old dogs scared a bunch of us away or wouldnt make room for us 2 engineering students were choosing SWE over other forms because it was way more lucrative. Throw in that its one of the few industries, the other being automotive, where engineers are often impacted by large scale strikes, and it doesnt inspire confidence in 18 year olds that its a good career choice. I graduated in the mid2000s with an AE degree, saw the writing on the wall and went into Tech. Im not saying the skill sets dont exist, but they are nowhere as prevalent as they were in the 80s and it will take a decade of aerospace success to motivate students to go into aerospace.

Reddit,2024-09-10,"How to cheat the market of 20 trillion? Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base. This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that dont exist. Is it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, its true.

He has very good knowledge of internal processes and how fast Intel can get bloated, its not the first time in this companys history. The bigger problem was once Pat came into play he was not focused on efficiency but solving the current issues with brute force. Meaning throwing as much money and people at it as possible. The issue that came into play that he slightly miscalculated how far Intel was actually behind. His famous philosophy back then was that by each generational cycle the competition came out Intel already offers 2. We can really see this in the current roadmap were Intel comes out with new products in way under 12 months in each space. When AMD and TSMC doesnt get their act together Intel will leapfrog them in 2025. This isnt the first time Intel has done this in its history. The issue now is that Intel is a long term play and in a currently not favorable position. Wall Street does not like that. They want fast money, fast quarterly results and dont care about anything else really. Now with the recent news about activist investors iam quite sure this news is fabricated by activist investors who manipulate the media in the background to gain shareholders favor. Dont fall for it. Intel wants to protect themselves from activist investors because they would try to split the company apart for the short term gain. If they would enter Intel is done. I really hope Pat will live long enough to see how what incredible work he has done. In 2025 we will see a very competitive Intel and in 2026 current Wallstreet critics will be very very silent.

Reddit,2024-08-27,"So Im going to take this a slightly different direction. Real Mistakes Intel has made 1. Looking into Holographic DUV rather than going all in on EUV. This is what caused them to lose their market position. This was the result of bean counters hoping the cheaper process would be good enough, but while it worked the yield rates were too low causing it to become uneconomically viable and forcing intel to not shrink their chips for multiple generations to maintain economic viability. 2. Some bugoversight causing 13th 14th gen chips to damage themselves slowly with overvoltage issues. They say they have it under control now with the new microcode update. Only time will tell if that is true. Mistakes INVESTORS are worried about that we dont know the outcome of yet 1. Massive investments into new fabs without a clear roadmap, clientele, etc who will use their contracting services. This makes their balance sheet look like shit and if they dont get some big clients this will be a gigantic waste of money. 2. Their mistakes and anticonsumer approaches are degrading a core customer base in the server sector. AMD is also going after the server market more aggressively. This puts their long term market position in jeopardy. 3. They are making a lot of long term bets on things like GPUs that are hemmoraging money. While I believe this is probably best for them in the long term investors want their money this quarter and these types of plays are just not what they want to see. Reasons to be optimistic 1. Their current chips have honestly caught up to AMD. The 14th gen that arent killing themselves match or exceed the top AMD chips in a wide variety of tasks. 7800X3D is overall best gaming GPU but after that there is a long list of great performance cpus from intel. 2. The 9000 series from AMD is overall a bit of a dud. VERY little benefit over the 7000 series which a large part of the 14th gen already was beating. The 7800X3D still best for consumers and while most of the benefits for the 9000 series is for servers and heavey multithreaded workloads the jump isnt particularly impressive and well below what we normally expect for a generational leap. If 15th generation even an average boost compared to 14th gen its VERY likely intel takes a clear lead in the market. My take. Intel is making multiple long term plays and people are getting super ancy because they have had 2 major mistakes in the last decade. These are really risky gambles with hundreds of billions of dollars and if even 1 of these turns out to be a complete failure it will be a huge issue for the company. By end of 2025 first service fabs will be online, battlemage gpus will be out, and we will know if 15th gen is better than 9000 series or if they also stumble like AMD on this generational update. Given the massive hits in their recent stock, there likely is a lot of upside potential IF they pull it off. The idea they are risk adverse to me doesnt really track with their current heavy investment strategy. The culture might be risk adverse but they are playing with fire here. Messing up and having another microcode issue is something they CANT afford. AMDs messups are giving them an opportunity to regain their footing and we wont know how this plays out until probably end of next year. I expect the stock to go down or stay put until we see how these bets pay off and any investment in INTEL is just betting on this stuff working out. Only project that has me super worried for them is the contract fabs. Its REALLY not clear who they would be getting contract work from. Unless they get an Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc style client I honestly DONT know how they can justify the cost and I just dont see any of those companies leaving TSMC in a serious capacity. There just arent many customers in the world that can even use this service and stealing them from TSMC wont be easy.",Positive,0,0.8513378500938416,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-27,"Just couple of days back I mentioned this on WSB. I work in BayArea in big tech company Over 100B in Rev. Intel is in shambles, Intel was a pioneer no doubt. It was led by Engineers where Engineers had more control in 90s and early 2000s. Then came MBA grads who brought the culture of Lets milk the cow by pushing 1 perf increase and people were buying their shit even till 201314. MBA Grads started feeling that they dont need Engineers and started kicking them out Well go back and see Intel lays off in thousands every year yups pick any year and they would have laid off atleast 1000 employees. The company is in such a bad shape that now almost all good engineers are gone. MBA grads left now with no idea what to do. 1 Company is stopping dividends. 2 Company is not giving any cash bonus to their employees they are giving RSUs. Basically the internal buying of Intel which you see is Intel doing buy back and giving it to their employees instead of cash. Company is trying to save cash desperately. Even if TSMC stops tomorrow, Intel doesnt have enough good quality engineers left anymore. No amount of money is gonna save them. Pat got billions from US Govt my tax dollars and has not shown anything in real except promises and PPTs. Intel would have been obliterated long back. below points just prolonged their life a bit. 1 Pandemic Boom When chips, laptops, etc were selling like cakes.

Many of these folks moved to AMD, Amazon, Google and what not. I have friends who work in these positions and keep 1st hand info of where the talent is moving. Intel is drained of talent, Partners and Customers arw worried if they buy Intel chips can Intel even provide proper support for next 5yrs. Enterprise deals are locked in for 510yrs and customers look at Sellers health as well. First hand info coming that many customers are worried with Intels next 710yr survival and if they buy 20M of chips they might get stuck. It is not about making fastest chip on the block. AMD is increasing their ER and Intel is burning cash pile super fast and customers are losing trust. Wait till Nov 2024, You might hear something big coming up in favor of AMD.

Reddit,2024-08-15,"I dont like Starbucks, never really have. But its an interesting thought exercise If you were given 85 million signing bonus plus an even sicker compensation package, what changes would you make to prove you were worth it? Myself, my forte is in making services and products undeniably great, and letting quality drive the business side. Not to the exclusion of shrewd business strategy and tactics, but I just put the priority on having something great that people want, and letting that be the flywheel. So for me, Id finally accept the incredibly common perception that Starbucks actual coffee is mediorceburnt. Weve seen others publicly and with humility accept and fix that... see McCafe, DPZ, CMG, etc. For those who say you cant make that change! I say you cant expect big changes unless you make changes. For those who say the old is good enough, I point to the stock performance as proof its not. Id be the best quality and go with a nicer but more broadly appealing taste profile. As SBUX, wed have the scale and resources to get the very best while still benefitting from scale. Im not sweating about margins in the first wave of this transformation because frankly a drink that you can charge a food price for suggests margin not be a problem over time. Second Id embrace some tech. People are kind of over the myth that you need a slow paced barista teasing out your drink for five minutes. CafeLux and Nespresso have shown you can get 90 of great coffee or cold drinks without lifting a finger. Id seek to take the best of learnings from those and apply them to a faster service model. Maybe that means the barista role is to focus on the part only they can do, and do best, but spares them from the other 90. Thats still TBD, but the goal of pumping out the actual drinks, cold or hot, WAY faster is not negotiable. In parallel wed have some kind of highly mediamentionable value choices. Perhaps not the 99 cent coffee that every pundit thinks they were the first to think of, since it would only be reinforcing the oldbad taste and also trading short term traffic surge which isnt the problem for weaker reputation and perception. But maybe some quick and easy 3 buck options that are enough to generate broad public knowledge. The taste and speed have to be newsworthy upgrades. The value options must also generate a buzz, but should be aligned with supporting not undermining the first two priorities. There would be more phases, but the emergency mission would be whole new supply and taste, combined with huge efficiency boost by automating that which can be. That phase alone probably justifies yesterdays 20 billion move.",Positive,2,0.7761634588241577,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-15,"I understand Nicol did great work at Chipotle, thats fine. I just dont understand why they dont spend time and resources searching for someone who thinks they can do it and has a plan. To me, it seems lazy and disgusting. This guy better do a real good job with how much they are handing over. Do you know what I mean? Its a big job sure but this mentality of thinking just this guy can do the job looks stupid to me. Maybe Im wrong, I guess the important thing to them is that they spend the money on the guy they think has the best odds of accomplishing their goals. And id take the money too, but its hard to not feel negative about one man getting all this money but I do suppose he has a big job ahead that will likely be stressful. But doesnt everyone feel that way about their jobs....ok Ill stop. Lol. And I read a comment, they have taken out seating. Yeah Im sure you need to get paid a few million for being that issue to light lol. I hardly ever go there because Im not into spending my money on that, dont go to Dunkin either. But the one thing I can recall about Starbucks is how the food in display looks like fake cardboard or something and isnt appetizing looking at all. I felt like asking if food is real.

Our health system is predatory to the extreme and only accessible to the wealthiest among us. Our police force is murderously violent, and protects corporate interests above the citizenry. Our financial systems have been completely overrun by billionaire fraudsters and now operate on boom and bust cycles that pilfer public funds. Our food production has been brutally industrialized and our food itself has been stuffed with toxic additives and overprocessed to squeeze out every last cent of profit. Unions and workers rights have been demonized and systematically deconstructed. Worker pay has been under gradual decline for half a century, while housing has become yet another investment vehicle causing costs to skyrocket. Our politicians, fully and openly bought by the oligarchs, obstruct any attempt at change while engaging in public hedonism.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"There is about a 300 billion premium on the net equity of the company. What this means simplified is that the market value all shares x share price of BRK is currently 920b and the equity assets liabilities is 571b in q1. If Berkshire closed its doors in secret from the market as to not influence the market before selling all assets and paying all debts, it would walk away with the net equity of 571b. So in very layman terms that is the minimum value of the company. The market currently thinks Berkshire is worth 300b more than its equity. I assume some of that 300b will take an immediate hit, lets say 10. 30b off a market value of 920b is 3, plus if hes sick it may go down in pieces. It will be important to get a younger 55 face of the company. As for Buffets 16 share of the company that should be in his will and children and charity would be the obvious guesses. Charity would mean a big sell off which might be a 5 dip in the price too.",Neutral,0,0.99989914894104,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-02,"Yes. But Gelsinger is really working off of mistakes made by leadership 810 years ago. Foundry leadership in particular is not simply won or lost in a quarter, or even a couple of years. For example, when Intel first released its 14nm CPUs in Q3 2014 TSMC was on a 20nm process and TSMC vs Intel processes are not 11. Eg Intels 10nm is akin to TSMCs 7nm. Intel didnt move away from a 14nm process on desktop consumer chips until Alder Lake in November of 2021. In that time TSMC went from a 20nm process to a 4nm one albeit not in full production. So in 7 years Intel went from leading TSMC by several generations to being behind by between 12 generations. By the time Gelsinger joined in 2021 the most extensive damage had been done. This isnt even going into the design side Intel missed mobile, GPUs, ARM, etc. They were slow to adopt chiplets, have confusing NUMA configs due to P and E cores vs AMD, and they arent where AMD is with 3D caches. They are in the DPU game with their IPUs but their only customer is Google, AWS is ahead with Nitros and Azure has their own play with Azure Boost.

Some of these people have spending issues what may come from impulse control what is why they go into massive debt. If you tell these same people to invest their own money it may not go well. Investing should be boring for decades and there are a lot of behaviors everyone has that will make them poor investors FOMO and Yoloing your savings on a hot stock Chasing dividends because you dont understand how dividends work Overtrading , or buying and selling too much probably because you are trying market timing So I can maybe see why he pushes going to financial advisors because you could argue maybe people with poor impulse control will do better just turning their money over to someone would be better. Or that he just makes lots of money referring people to these advisors is a more cynical view but I am sure there is some truth to that However if you have some basic discipline its not hard or complicated to go the boggleheads route and do the simple 3 fund portfolio , especially if you do not have a complex finacial situation , meaning if you work a W2 job just looking to invest some extra money for retirement going with the bogle heads 3 fund portfolio will most likely outperform what ever investments your FA has.",Neutral,0,0.9286671876907349,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-28,"A great way to learn to manage your money is to setup a brokerage account with Schwab, fidelity, etc and buy and sell a handful of stocks and etfs. Once you get a feel for the process its basically the same in a 401k or IRA. The only difference is a 401k tax advantage retirement account and the 401k is probably going to be far more limited in what you can buy, many are usually just mutual funds that are just like etfs, except an etf you can buy and sell at any time throughout the day like a stock, where a mutual fund you sell and it sells after trading is over for the day. An IRA is tax advantaged too but will have all the options of a brokerage account. Mutual funds are set and forget, dividends get reinvested, etc, etfs give you a little more control but can be setup the same way. I find etfs yo be easier because I know what they contain. VOO for example is basically trading the SP500. VFIAX is the fidelity mutual fund version of the same thing. For me mutuals fund are more work because it difficult to find what is in the fund and what proportions. ETF I find are easier because I can buy VOO and buy a few individual share of google or nvidia or something else if I want to be heavier somewhere. There are etfs for almost any specific sector too like healthcare industry, or consumer goods McDonalds coke, etc. There is no wrong way but after a lot of time, many of us have realized that its really hard to do better than just buying VOO. Its really that simple and any advisor worth their salt will put you heavy in the SP500.

So Nvidia could buy 10 Apple Parks in one year. If such a thing was possibleand its not. There are about 30,000 employees in Nvidia. You could give every employee about 1.7M in overtime to try and spur innovation. But, of course, that would translate into like 250 hours a week work scheduleassuming they were hourly instead of salaried. Youre really underestimating how much money this is and how short period of time. Theres really not a lot you can do with it. Acquisitions are probably the number one thing. Other than that, its really returning it to investors. And buybacks have a really gigantic benefit to the company in that. They also capture more of their future earnings. Dividends are a mixed bag and dont give you future earnings. In fact, they give you a playbook youre kind of forced to follow. Meaning, people expect that dividend to be Increased pretty regularly. And if its not, theyre gonna burn your stock. And as much money as they have, the dividend wouldnt be that much. With the money they utilizing, they could instead buy every Lamborghini and every Ferrari on the face of the earth and have a really gigantic crash up derby, and destroy them all in order to boost employee morale.

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Why are you OK with this Shares of Vans and The North Face owner VF Corporation slid Monday as JPMorgan put the apparel giant on its Negative Catalyst Watch list. JPMorgan analysts told clients after field work and discussions with management, they cut their estimate for VFs fiscal 2025 earnings per share. The analysts pointed to wholesale challenges with The North Face, and ongoing traffic headwinds across brands. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients that after recent fieldwork and management access, they cut their fiscal 2025 earnings per share EPS estimate to 65 cents, which they noted was 35 below the Wall Street consensus. The analysts based that on an 8 yearoveryear decline in revenue, also worse than consensus forecasts. Ill add that Im not saying just because JPM says its bad, its bad. But wanted to get your take on why its not bad. Why not just wait till after Q2 print to buy to see where things shake out. How did you get comfortable.

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Summary V.F. Corp has experienced fluctuations in its financial performance over the past four fiscal years, showing growth in revenue but facing challenges with declining net income. The companys EBITDA and operating income have varied significantly, while balance sheet metrics have seen declines. Margins and ratios have been mixed, with a notable drop in net profit margin. VFC has faced both positive and negative news in the market and is exposed to diverse risks across operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG factors. Key Financial Insights Revenue increased from 9.24 billion in 2020 to 11.61 billion in 2023 but declined to 10.45 billion in 2024. Net income dropped significantly from positive figures to a loss of 968.88 million in 2024. Gross profit margins remained stable, ranging from 41 to 52. Positive free cash flow in most years, except for 2023. Historical volatility of 58 indicates moderate stock price volatility compared to the market. Risk Factors Operational risks from supply chain disruptions and quality control issues. Regulatory risks related to trade policies, labor regulations, and environmental standards. Macroeconomic risks including economic downturns, currency fluctuations, and inflation. Competitive risks due to industry competition and evolving consumer preferences. Technological risks from cybersecurity threats and the need for digital investments. ESG risks impacting brand reputation and consumer perception. Conclusion Given the mixed financial performance, market sentiments, and diverse risks facing V.F. Corp, it is recommended to hold the stock for now. Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports, risk management strategies, and industry trends before making any significant buying or selling decisions.",Negative,-1,0.9561613202095032,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Because there are way more positive catalysts than this single negative catalyst. I agree that TNF is currently the revenue driver hence this delayed winter in the States could affect sales. But keep in mind 60 of the sales comes from Europe Asia. Only 40 of it comes from the US. One thing this analyst Matthew Boss didnt add in his thesis is the thriving backpacks business of TNF, this and international sales would likely offset the decline in the US. One more thing is that the CEO has already guided TNF revenue downwards for the coming quarter last earnings call. The stock also has retraced since this negative catalyst watch, so you could argue it is priced in. The problem with holding off the purchase because of this one negative catalyst is that when all the other brands show signs of turning Vans, Timbs, Dickies of which the latter two and he announces two more brand sales Jansport Kipling and completely brings us back to optimal capital structure, we would be off to the races, being potentially valued at 1x PS which would be 10B in market cap.",Negative,-1,0.998784601688385,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"I was a scientist in the nuclear industry in the 80s and 90s, its going to be a decade before I retire. Ive worked on reactors, reprocessing and warhead production. In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is.

That was V C Summer 23, another pair of AP1000s. Westinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt. Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK.

So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid i.e. majority of energy demand then large reactors are the way to go. The actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 57 data centers of 5 GW power each.

Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs.

I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Oh, the AP1000 is a great design, as youll see downthread on the other reply to my comment. Definitely the best LWR design currently on the market. But the nuclear industry always claims that theyll learn their lessons and the next build will be smoother and on time and budget. And it never is. Basically every plant built in the 70s and 80s in the US had huge overruns, and many were cancelled after TMI. Even Watts Bar took much longer to complete than expected. Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different. This is unfortunately why the nuclear industry, which should be a perfect complement to solar and wind, and perfect for AI, is instead a sunset industry.",Negative,-1,0.5214157700538635,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Yeah thats my understanding. The acquisition press releases state it is a 5149 percent split between BEPCCCJ, respectively. I did learn in further reading after this comment though that Westinghouse revenue will no longer include construction work, as some press releases I read excluded that from their business model when discussing the CCJBEPC acquisition. I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company. I wish I would have gone with my gut last month and bought CCJ 60 calls, as those would already be printing now. Instead I stayed on the sidelines smh.

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Update 2 This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Neutral,0,0.9939711689949036,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-28,"Eh, I have no real comments on the shorts reports, but VTOL is an extremely difficult thing that military has spend hundreds of billions and 80 years trying to make work with not much reliable success. Helicopters are considered mature technology yet also still very dangerous. Energy density of oil is still vastly superior to any batteries available which puts some hard current limits on things like range versus capacity. That said, theres some key differences between those and evtol. From a risk management perspective, All its going to take is one highly public Kobe Bryant or a Troy Gentry and the whole things going to crater. Thats very hard to predict but its still immature and early enough is thats all it going to take to eat massive losses.

Reddit,2024-09-28,I dont have patience to write long DD like this but can claim that I have done extensive research on this. My personal position is 100 LEAPS for Joby and 2150 in stock. I only believe in Joby and I strongly feel Archer is going to fold or go bust in 4 years or less. I will give reasons for this in short as I dont have patience n dont have time or care to convince anyone. 1. Joby truly developed eVTOL from scratch and have complete new new design. Archer is just electric helicopter where they are assembler of aircraft where why may have just swap the engine with electric motors. Due to this their aircraft is almost 1200lbs heavier than Joby. This in itself going to kill then in operating cost and cannot compete with Joby which will multi fold efficient n cheaper to operate thereby cheaper on pricing 2. Archer is mostly style n less substance. Their flight has yet to do extensive flight testing. They are flying empty . So currently its just baloon with no payload. Once you add payload most likely their design will go bust. The design is too heavy n bulky 3. Dilution Archer is going for extensive dilution every quarter against plant setup and labor supply from Stellantis . Moreover they plan issue more shares. 4. Archer certification in time is very difficult given they need to integrate number of desperate components n technology. Joby developed almost 8090 IP inhouse so they integrate seamlessly with common software language. 5. Archer is led by businessman vs Joby is led by technocrat 6. Joby has successfully tested hydrogen flight. In 56 year they will have it approved. Then they will have huge cost advantage and unparalleled technology edge 7. Autonomy only Joby has full autonomous rights to their own plane. Archer sold it to WiskBoeing. Robo AirTaxi. This is where real money is. Believe me Robo AirTaxi will happen before TeslaWaymo or Aurora. Once you do in depth study you will uncover few more obvious reasons why archer is way behind and over priced at current valuation.

Ive looked into Archer a few times now and while Im tempted to buy in, I have a couple of hurdles Im struggling to get over. First of all Im having a hard time seeing a scenario where they arent just acquired by another megacorp. Boeing going ballsdeep and consolidating them with Wisk makes a lot of sense both companies are functionally the same, it merely seems to be the case that Archer want to push a more VIP and militaryoriented aircraft lineup while Wisk is designed much more in the mould of an airtaxi Uber. Stellantis might also be interested in a direct acquisition if they can envision a more profitable return by cutting out other major investors like United and Boeing, as well as gaining them exposure to valuable US military contracts. Im also not fully convinced by the eVTOL airtaxi concept. As a means of rapid transportation it does have potential is there anyone who doesnt want to reach their destination not just in style but also half an hour earlier?? but I need to know exactly how theyre going to make it affordable for people that arent just highincome earners, because otherwise it will ultimately be an unprofitable service due to the complexity of the technology and the lack of a large clientele base.

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Oh its time. I knew it was time. I feel it. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. ... However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. ... While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Neutral,0,0.9955098628997803,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Good DD I have no issue with Joby but there are a few counter points to your DD that should be understood. 1. You make a big deal about creating their own IP but Archers counter point is that their parts are industry standard and can be purchased and produced more easily. Personally, I think both have a fair point. Archer also has their own IP in the most important parts which include the drive train. 2. I really like the look and feel of Archer way more than Joby. Joby looks like they took a drone from DJI and scaled it up to a person capable aircraft. Not necessarily a bad thing but as far as style goes Archer definitely has that edge. Also, they will soon have their pilot test certification soon. So thats no really a great argument against them. Their fortest certification is coming soon and will be a major announcement. 3. Nothing really to say here as this stuff aint cheap. Raising capital is something they both have to do. Its not like you can make the argument that Joby doesnt have to do this too. Both are have delivered aircraft to the military and both are set to deliver more. Again, both will be players in this arena and thats a good thing. Competition is a good thing. Dont forget a short report and subsequent short float on Joby is a thing too as their short is about 19. The reason why I chose Archer however is that their current market cap has much deeper value than Joby at these current levels. Currently Joby is valued at 3.74 Billion while Archer Aviation is valued at only 1.09 Billion with a much higher float. So, with all of that I have to think Archer at this moment is a better buy. Both of their market caps can easily be in the 50 100 Billion range in the 4 6 year future which will be a substantial gain for all those invested. In the short term, if Archer keeps pushing and gets their certs a 3x increase will be a 3 Billion market cap and that seems completely justified. That would also be a 300 increase in the stock price from 3 to 9 a share. I say this is an easy bagger if you ask me. Deep fucking value if there ever was one.",Neutral,0,0.9411562085151672,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-28,"How the hell does their eVTOL have have fewer failure points? They have more motors and more propellers not to mention the hinges that have to move to allow them to transition from vertical to horizontal flight. These thing arent exactly maintenance free, they still have to be inspected, lubed and maintained not to mention that there are more of them which means more places for thing to break or go wrong. Also how does an eVTOL pilot cost less? They still have to be trained to the standard that the FAA requires and since they are flying a vehicle that can fly like a helicopter or an airplane, they need to have training in both, something that is certainly not cheap. Being quieter might be nice but it offers not much of a benefit. Any aircraft that is within the noise limits will work, you dont get bonus points for being quieter. And using nontraditional fuels isnt really a flex when most airports dont have the chargers for them. Also being cool doesnt mean useful.

I see with autonomy more traffic will be on road increasing congestion so we will have to go to air. Biggest problem I see with eVTOL is it would be 3 rides to get to destination to heliport, air ride and then from heliport to final destination. eVTOLs have use cases diff than road travel flying from JFK to Long Branch NJ, between islands in Caribbeans, city centers to outskirts suburban mansions etc before they go full main stream.

Reddit,2024-09-14,"In approximately June 2022, Federico Nannini began advising Coral Gables based MasTec Inc. MasTec about the companys proposed acquisition of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative Inc. IEA. At the time, both MasTec and IEA traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Immediately after, Federico Nannini began sharing confidential information about the acquisition with Mauro Nannini and Thermiotis. Federico Nannini, Thermitois, and Tonarely had attended high school together in Pinecrest, Fla. Mauro Nannini bought shares the day after Federico Nannini received access to financial information about the proposed acquisition. Thermiotis also passed the confidential acquisition information to Tonarely, shortly after Tonarely texted him I want to make some money right now . . . What we do? After Thermiotis passed the confidential information to Tonarely, he texted Not a soul okay. According to the indictment, Tonarely responded back Obviously . . . You told me not to. Days later, Tonarelys family member signed a letter sponsoring Thermiotiss membership at a Miami yacht club. As the acquisition progressed, Federico Nannini updated his father and close friend about the transaction. Thermiotis, in turn, continued to update Tonarely. At one point in July 2022, when Federico Nannini became worried the acquisition would not go through, Mauro Nannini sold his IEA stock, according to the indictment. When Federico Nannini received confidential financials that indicated the acquisition was going forward, he texted Thermiotis Its going thru . . . Holy shit bro. Thermiotis responded Dont text . . .But lfg. At that point, Mauro Nannini began to buy back his position in IEA stock and options. When MasTecs acquisition of IEA was reported publicly on July 25, 2022, Mauro Nannini, Thermiotis, and Tonarely all sold their shares and option contracts in IEA at a profit. Two days later, on July 27, 2022, Federico Nannini texted Thermiotis a picture of a Rolex Daytona, saying You wanna hook it up for the boy. I know its a little over budget but this is the one. Thermiotis responded Haahaha yeah but give it a bit . . . Prices should come down a bit on everything.",Neutral,0,0.9999898672103882,Reply

Japans nicetiesbased society really benefited from using pandemic as the ultimate card to demand work place changes, mainly thanks to the extremely old management relenting as it put the fear of mortality into them, while any pushbacks would be met with society hitting them with the HOW DARE YOU ENDANGER THE SOCIETY WHEN THERES A VIRUS AROUND",Neutral,0,0.9745568037033081,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-27,"Chat GPT summary Cassava Sciences, a biotech company focused on Alzheimers disease, has come under scrutiny due to its lead drug candidate, Simufilam. Initially, the company showed promising early clinical results, but recent developments have cast significant doubt on the drugs efficacy. The indictment of Dr. Wang, a key researcher involved in Simufilams earlystage studies, for allegedly fabricating data, alongside the sudden resignation of CEO Remi Barbier and the SVP of Neuroscience, has raised red flags. These events, coupled with ongoing legal challenges, have led to increased skepticism about the validity of the data supporting Simufilam and the companys overall credibility. The companys situation has deteriorated further with concerns over potential unblinding of trial data and inconsistencies in reported results. Despite Cassavas new leadership promising transparency, the current circumstances have significantly undermined confidence in Simufilams chances of success. The ongoing investigations and the potential 40 million SEC settlement add to the financial strain on the company. Given the high stakes and the reliance on a single product, any negative outcomes from the trials or legal proceedings could severely impact the stock. As a result, the overall outlook for Cassava remains highly cautious, with significant risks to its future viability.",Negative,-1,0.9999977350234985,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-26,"I dont know why people ignore trends. The economy is a mack truck, not a motorcycle. It doesnt turn on a dime. 5 unemployment is pretty much baked in at this point. Its going to happen at some point in the next 12 months...its not if but when. Even if the Fed cut the rates to 1 right now, wed still get there, because of the time lag of policy. The dire situation is that the Fed continues to pretend they can influence shortterm macroeconomics with decisions they make today. Like the single quarter or half point cut they deliver in September is going to do jackshit to arrest the clear trend of a rapidly declining work economy. Seriously, show my anywhere in this chart where the unemployment line starts turning up and then just smooths out or recovers without some kind of asymptotic spike. Once sentiment goes south, thats it. Fear is selfreinforcing. And were nearly there. Simply, we should have been at 45 Fed rate for the last few months, and should have been nearing a neutral rate of high 3s by the end of this year. Instead, were still severely restrictive. And at the rate the Fed wants to move, were not going to get to a neutral rate until mid2025, if not later. The dire situation will be recognized soon enough. Not everyone can see the iceberg yet. And as usual, when they do, its going to be far too late. Though on the positive side of things, I dont think itll be a particularly nasty or extended recession due to a number of positive factors, including most people being locked into low rate mortgages. Itll be shortterm economic malaise, the market will likely overfreak out, unemployment may peak around 67, and then well be back to a smooth sailing bull market.

So when workers replaced the door plug temporarily, other workers were unaware that bolts needed to be reinstalled, said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Ive worked at MRO facilities that help repair the planes at the airports when the airliners want to save money, instead of getting the manufacturer like embraer or boeing to repair it. There are numerous issues in my brief stint there, but they are similar to the first rollout when the plane is being built. There is a lack of talented blue collar workers to do the repairsinstall because they are underpaid and literally undocumented hispanic workers. The actual MODMRB engineers that do the analysis are understaffed but typically have to be on call whenever a plane is grounded. The Damage tolerance team is on call basically 247 with rotating shifts and regularly gets woken up to handle shit. There is not enough organization in documentation and SOP to do the repair according to a manual. Especially when every airline has their own manual that they want you to download from airbus world but the manual is just a scanned pdf with no ctrlf capabilities whatsoever. Everyone is just out for themselves, trying to do the least amount of work as possible, while goofing off, and just caring about blowing their next pitiful paycheck on some fds or something. This creates a culture of keeping your head down and not caring about documentation, and definitely not trying to improve something when there is a deficiency in accountability.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"I work in the aerospace industry and its completely believable. The amount of times things that should be traceable are not is way too often. The amount of times Ive been presented with incomplete paperwork and am told just BS it is also way too high. A lot of management at other companies just dont care because the necessary papertrail requires a ton of time and slows every aspect of production down. We get audited annually but the audits dont do any digging. They ask for a random batch of jobs and as long as everything is filled out they assume it was done properly meaning the individual process and inspection steps on the travelers are filled out and complete prior to that part moving on to the next step. People are lazy and dont care and since there is no accountability its becoming common work culture to just BS the papertrail. FAA parts have such high requirements that if a door fell off a boeing jet 5 years after it was built the FAA should be able to reach out to boeing and know within a day exactly who had hands on that part, for what step, and at exactly what time, from the first ply of material to the last nut and bolt every single aspect of the manufacturing of that part is supposed to be recording. The FAA expects to be able to point a very accurate finger at the exact person responsible for that step anytime something goes wrong. For example if I forgot to install a bolt the papertrail would say that and myself and the QA inspector responsible could potentially be sued by the FAA or criminally charged for not adhering to their policies. The fact they cant provide this is insane to me. Weve had failures that the FAA has reached out to us about and within a few minutes of pulling the paper work we are able to tell them every single piece of information they want. Its an obnoxious amount of paperwork and a real hassle but when it comes to commercial aircraft its pretty fucking necessary.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"The colored gemstone market is complex and opaque. A spot price is unrealistic in a market of such varying qualities. Its not the first time people have tried to corner a gemstone market, most fail, government regulated supply is a weak hold and product moves through with the correct connections and money. Blue Zircon can be found in many localities and white zircon can be treated. The price and comparison should also be measured against a basket of similar gem material which you will find a similar trend in pricing that many mid tier gems have moved up in value over the last several years. This last year in Tucson anecdotal discussions with gem dealers and purchasers indicated some level of inverse pricing from mine to consumers, it was more expensive material at the mine source than what was being sold in Tucson, mainly due to cash buyers paying premiums for large lots at the source. The price to reach 10K per carat is unrealistic in a lifetime term. This material is just not that rare to reach high grade ruby and sapphire pricing. if you can get 300 you are good, if you get 500 for high quality large pieces great, but the average is lower and there is a lot of material that is treated flooding the market some show up directly at the mines. A good resource on pricing and markets is GIA field Gemologist Wim Vertriest who has written many articles on sourcing stones and the market in general and has a large focus in SE Asian markets.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"In Mar 2020, when the world was shutting down because of Covid, I decided it was a great idea to take a vacation to Cambodia and force my gf to come with me ... is all you really need to know about the amount of forethought that went into any of OPs plans, including trying to monopolize a semiprecious gemstone that CHIPS OFF easily as the next trend in wearable jewelry. Their hardness is a 6 on a scale of 10, where diamonds are a 10. The reason ppl can wear diamonds on their fingers is bc they dont chip when abused. Theres also the fact that actual big money can just reopen mines at scale if these were to ever actually appreciate substantially in value, which they wont, because they suck as precious stones and dont have any industrial use. No one cares about how old and sparkly they are if they cant be effectively cut into a particular shape because theyre prone to shattering first.. Also, the math isnt even correct. 1m carats at 10ea is 10m, not 250k. Also, current price per carat appears to be nowhere near 150300 after a brief google search. Also, OP appears to be trying to spin this investment failure into an even farther fetched plan by creating a crypto token and tokenizing blue zircon into a realworldasset... but its already a real world asset, just not one that anyone wants.

Except I found an easy way to find these rocks. With a few friends we went out and mined roughly 500 lbs of these rocks and contacted a guy who sold them. He bought the whole lot from us for around 10k dollars. We went back out and mined another 200 or so lbs but when we reached back out the broker told us hed sold roughly 100 lbs of our first find before the market collapsed. Once there was a steady sales stream the interest and bidding wars for these rocks was gone. To this day saffordites sell for pennies an ounce...

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Story time I have a friend whose dad is a gem and mineral dealer. When we were in high school it wasnt his full time job or anything, it was more of a hobbyside business. But then after he retired it basically becalmed his full time jobbusiness. And let me tell you, business is booming. Ive seen some wild things while traveling in that circle of high end gem and mineral dealing. In Colorado for example, where weed is legal but the banks wont touch it, Ive seen people come in and drop 30k, 50k etc. in cash on a single tourmaline, with the intent to resell it at some point as a way to legitimize their capital. We call them Wookiees because theyre typically very hairy, and dont bathe much. Then theres the oil and gas geologists who have absurd amounts of money but dress like theyre in between hikes. Theres the HealyFealys who believe the crystals have some sort of magical properties. How they pick a rock thatll increase their Luck, or Prosperity, or bolster their love life is anyones guess. Then youve got the standard investors who are looking to diversify their wealth into collectible class assets or Asset Class Collectibles Ive heard both used. Theyre looking for something they can park their money in and resell for a profit later. You also get just collectors. People whose rock collection went way beyond what you could even fathom as a kid picking cool rocks out of a garden bed. Ive seen some specimens change hands for 7 figures or more. Truly a different world.",Neutral,0,0.9999438524246216,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Hmmm. Blue zircon has a similar hardness to emerald, quartz and garnet. Fair to tough range. A lot of people say dont recommend emerald for a daily wear ring or engagement ring as can get scratched and damaged. So ..it is more preferred corundum stones and diamond for that. There are also a lot of advancements in synthetic diamonds happening now first mostly yellow, but also blue diamonds might be created. Sapphire the most famous blue stone can already be created synthetically and blue topaz as well is relatively affordable just from natural sources and a fair amount of good color tanzanite floating around. There are some that like collecting niche gemstones but that is a small part of the market compared to the jewelry industry. The name..is also a problem in that it has nothing to do with cubic zirconia, but the name zircon sounds similar so peoples perception it is a synthetic or low cost gemstone. But one of its biggest flaws in use in jewelry is that exposure to UV can turn blue zircon into an unappealing brown. That is the main reason it has not been widely adopted for jewelry. Almost a similar problem to welo opal that turns dull and yellow over time. Apatite...another blue stone that has a lovely shade can also fade and change color with UV exposure.",Neutral,0,0.9953140020370483,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-07,"As I am a graduate gemologist and big fan of the unique, I will agree Zircon is a wonderful stone. Its stunning brilliance really out does many other crystals. What your fighting right now is a global move to lab grown stones. You took a huge gamble with your investment and you do have considerable profit even if you liquidate now based on your numbers. I would look to partner with a manufacturer and begin to make peace with your investment. Its easy to get overwhelmed with facts and figures, you did well. You state average cost at 10carat with a current price of 100150carat thats a serious gain. However what your dealing with now is beanie babies in the 90s. Will it skyrocket in the next years and keep adding value or will people just stop caring? I wish you good luck in your future, I am jealous as zircon is a stone Ive not got to add to my collection.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Most of what OP said is of course complete bullshit. Blue zircons are not the oldest gems on earth. Zircons in general, because of their small Uranium content, are used in Geology to date the rocks they are in using the UPb dating method. So they found some inherited small zircons in an Australian conglomerate that were 4.4 Ga years old. those are neither blue though nor do they have anything to do with OPs zircons. OPs zircons are less than 1 million year old and therefore very young certainly much much younger than any diamonds. In fact, you would never find natural i.e. not heat treated old, gemquality zircons. The radioactive elements in them mainly U and Th decay over time and slowly destroy the crystal lattice. All old zircons will therefore look somewhat eaten up. Blue Zircons are also neither rare nor even natural. The blue color is achieved by heating gemquality zircons which are usually yellow or orange up to about 1000degC. Zircons themselves are not rare at all either, almost every rock has some in them. Even large gemquality specimens are relatively common. Thats why you can get them for literally pennies on the internet.",Neutral,0,0.9999521970748901,Reply

Using diamond as thats the only other jewellery stone I know that has this value per carat The hardness of zircon is far far less than diamond at c6.5, this is a serious factor in pricing a gemstone. You say that the mines in Cambodia were closing but youve also got Sri Lanka and Australia which have huge reserves of zircon. Which I guess would make up the shortfall from Cambodia?

Its not undervalued, it is valued at what the market is willing to pay for it and their plan to artificially drive up demand is laughably unhinged to anyone who understands anything about anything. OP makes it sound like theres only one closed mine in Cambodia, but their own country, Australia, produces like 40 of the worlds supply of blue zircon and its also mined in Sri Lanka and Africa, as well. Zircon itself is a very common mineral, like its everywhere in the Earths crust. Its also a terrible gemstone due to its brittleness and tendency to scratch. Weve also been able to grow and mass produce zirconscubic zirconia in a laboratory setting, which requires no slave labor, for decades now, and its becoming cheaper and more efficient year after year. There are also multiple other gemstones with similar visual qualities that are much more suitable for jewelry applications and are much cheaper, like moissanite and blue topaz. The extra stupid part of this is that there are plenty of gemstonesminerals which actually have the increasing scarcity that OP is looking for. Turquoise is a great example. It is a relatively rare semiprecious gemstone with only a handful of mines producing it in any significant quantity worldwide. Most of what you see labeled as turquoise on the market now is actually cheaper and more common stones marketed as turquoise because of how scarce real turquoise is becoming. Its basically only found in great quantities in the American southwest and the mines in the southwest have been running dry and falling short of demand for quite a while.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"You realise that most of the zircons you own are less than 1 million years old right? Its literally in the abstract of the paper you cited. The age of other zircons you dont own are as relevant to the value of your zircons as the fact knives being 2.5 million years old affect the value of cutlery at IKEA. Zircon from Ratanakiri Province, northeastern Cambodia, is well known in the gem trade for its vivid blue colour that results from heat treatment. The untreated brown material turns blue under reducing conditions at 9001,000degC. Ratanakiri zircon is characterised by remarkably low contents of trace elements. In particular, the actinides have low concentrations e.g. approximately 120 ppm U and 95 ppm Th. Together with the very young age of the zircon 1 million years Ma...

Reddit,2024-08-07,"If Zircon does catch in global markets and becomes a fashion trend, much more money and resources will be put into mining which will bring scarcity down. No doubt those closed mines in Cambodia would be reopened as legitimate mining operations considering the profit potential. Even if his company tries to buy all the Zircon from the mines to perpetuate the artificial scarcity, the mines will surely demand more money for each carat which will cut their profit margins or make them drive the prices up even more, pricing 99 of people out and creating a bubble. Big players in mining would establish their own business anyway probably. The De Beers had a monopoly on diamonds for a century, but as new diamond sources were established they lost that control.
