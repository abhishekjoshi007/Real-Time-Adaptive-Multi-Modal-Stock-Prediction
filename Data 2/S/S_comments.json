You need to know, have a really deep technical knowledge of the asset you are investing in. You need to know at the same level the competing technologies. i.e. your baby SC, and not only.. You need to know very well all the others and possible runners up...  And that is not enough! You need to understand the market vertical, its evolution and past history.. It&#39;s not easy! Then there is always the &#39;Luck&#39; aspect and bad executive/director board decisions that mess things up, always a variable in play... However this variable risk can be attenuated by the actual deep knowledge on the matter at stake... If you think deeply and meditate, you will realize that investing a buck in S1 today, it&#39;s way less risky than investing or keeping a position on your CS and several others. It also has a much larger over-head room to grow. S1 has the possibility to change a life! Whilst CS has all ready changed many.. So hardly any more investors will change their lives based on an investment today in CS and many others hotties today, however in death row tomorrow i.e Zs..."

Also from the recent earning call they seem to want to make another acquisition soon and I’m sure they dilute shares more."

I would even say above 60% growth but I’m being very conservative. Analyst and their target setting in any stock means nothing. They are all clowns and do t know much more then any regular serious investor out there. So December earnings is the make or break it moment for S."

I expect the earnings call will provide very positive guidance, as S will benefit over the coming months from Crowdstrike&#39;s misfortunes.   It&#39;ll be a slow rise, not meteoric, as earnings and revenue will gradually increase over the next 1 -2 years.    Remember, most companies can&#39;t fire crowdstrike overnight and switch to a different endpoint protection provider;  Rather, they&#39;ll just not renew their contract with Crowdstrike when it comes up for renewal.  By the way, Crowdstrike tends to go with 1 year contracts instead of the standard 3 year deals, so S should benefit quite a bit over the next 12 months from Crowdstrike customers moving on.    Crowdstrike&#39;s market cap hit $100 billion before the debacle;   Based on that, its fairly easy to imagine SentinelOne having a market cap of at least $30 Billion, which translates into a stock price of ~$90.   I&#39;m buying a bunch and will wait a 12 - 15 months to see if I&#39;m right!"

So your class b holders are willing to sell even at today high 20s price.  Why $50 becuase that’s will make it more expensive for an acquirer meaning they’ll need to shell out about $20 billion on the low side. Just like no one will acquire crowdstrike because. It too expensive. Finally at current share price levels S is vulnerable for a buyout since they also have good tech.
