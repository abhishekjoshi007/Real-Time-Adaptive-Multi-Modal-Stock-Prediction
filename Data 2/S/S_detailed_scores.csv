Yahoo,2024-08-20,"Now is a very good time to buy S.  I expect the earnings call will provide very positive guidance, as S will benefit over the coming months from Crowdstrike&#39;s misfortunes.   It&#39;ll be a slow rise, not meteoric, as earnings and revenue will gradually increase over the next 1 -2 years.    Remember, most companies can&#39;t fire crowdstrike overnight and switch to a different endpoint protection provider;  Rather, they&#39;ll just not renew their contract with Crowdstrike when it comes up for renewal.  By the way, Crowdstrike tends to go with 1 year contracts instead of the standard 3 year deals, so S should benefit quite a bit over the next 12 months from Crowdstrike customers moving on.    Crowdstrike&#39;s market cap hit $100 billion before the debacle;   Based on that, its fairly easy to imagine SentinelOne having a market cap of at least $30 Billion, which translates into a stock price of ~$90.   I&#39;m buying a bunch and will wait a 12 - 15 months to see if I&#39;m right!",Positive,1,1.0,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-12,Okay Kevin yet S Almost sold itself last summer in 2023 if you recall to Wiz and it declined their offer because it was low 20 share price offer and S was something like $19. So your class b holders are willing to sell even at today high 20s price.  Why $50 becuase that’s will make it more expensive for an acquirer meaning they’ll need to shell out about $20 billion on the low side. Just like no one will acquire crowdstrike because. It too expensive. Finally at current share price levels S is vulnerable for a buyout since they also have good tech. Now next summer because interest rates will be much lower by then and it will make the acquirers financing much more doable and profitable.,Negative,-1,0.9410279989242554,Main
Yahoo,2024-08-11,So this is what I think. If this S doesn’t push past at least above $50 by early next summer it will be brought out and I’m sure investors won’t be happy with the sales price.
