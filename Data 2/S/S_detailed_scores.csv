Yahoo,2024-08-20,"Now is a very good time to buy S.  I expect the earnings call will provide very positive guidance, as S will benefit over the coming months from Crowdstrike&#39;s misfortunes.   It&#39;ll be a slow rise, not meteoric, as earnings and revenue will gradually increase over the next 1 -2 years.    Remember, most companies can&#39;t fire crowdstrike overnight and switch to a different endpoint protection provider;  Rather, they&#39;ll just not renew their contract with Crowdstrike when it comes up for renewal.  By the way, Crowdstrike tends to go with 1 year contracts instead of the standard 3 year deals, so S should benefit quite a bit over the next 12 months from Crowdstrike customers moving on.    Crowdstrike&#39;s market cap hit $100 billion before the debacle;   Based on that, its fairly easy to imagine SentinelOne having a market cap of at least $30 Billion, which translates into a stock price of ~$90.

So your class b holders are willing to sell even at today high 20s price.  Why $50 becuase that‚Äôs will make it more expensive for an acquirer meaning they‚Äôll need to shell out about $20 billion on the low side. Just like no one will acquire crowdstrike because. It too expensive. Finally at current share price levels S is vulnerable for a buyout since they also have good tech.
