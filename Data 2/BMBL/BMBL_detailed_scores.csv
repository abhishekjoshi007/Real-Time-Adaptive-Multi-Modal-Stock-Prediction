Reddit,2024-09-25,"This was my first Reddit post after being a long time watcher so not sure the best way to answer all these damn questions... didnt think id get such a response. ill try to answer the main ones in this comment. 1. NVDA... i kept feeling like i missed the train. my only NVDA play was a put. And for those wanting a column for puts or calls i just put parentheses on the tickers that i bought puts on 2. i only exercised a big AAPL and a big WULF one on accident because i forgot about the exp date. i sold the next day because it basically drained all of my cash. so essentially same gains as if i just sold to close the calls. 3. Hot damn.. enough on the colors. i added it last min and didnt even think about your tiny brains not being able to just spot a trend and ignore the color yellow for 5 seconds 4. in terms of strategy... a lot of these losers are from stupid DD posts on this thread. most of the winners are just from me thinking a stock got unfairly beat up after a piece of news. like the LOGI calls for 405 were just because the stock tanked after the submarine imploded. the media blamed a logitech controller and i thought that was regarded so i bought short term calls back to their average and it printed prettty quick 69 days 5. i have owned a bunch of stocks for a long time and didnt want to show total portfolio value because it sort of takes away from only the options activity. have roughly 650k in the market right now and try not to have more than 30k in options exposure at any given time. 6. Lastly... i just let the losers run to expiration because im hoping for big news and then i forget to sell them. For the winners, i lost out a lot on being greedy but many times when its over 100 i will take out my investment and just roll with the house money. most of the time these 100 positions were up considerably well before exp and i was too greedy to sell and take some money off the table. Hope that helps or explains some of the questions ive been getting !imgemotet5_2th524276",Neutral,0,0.9952942728996277,Reply

Instead of realizing a normal investors 20 gains over the period, you have realized 91 gains while at the same time adding a ton of downside potential which thankfully you avoided. Seems like a solid strategy to be honest if you were looking for more risk more reward. But at the end of the day it isnt sustainable and you should quit and put the balance into VOO or something. You show good bankroll management skills based on the risk you are putting out there at least. The problem is if you only put 5 of your money at risk the other 95 is sitting in money market account and those rates are dropping tremendously now and into the future.

Reddit,2024-08-09,"Its gamified dating. Like any app game, the developer makes most of their money off the small percentage of people buying ingame upgrades and subscriptions. The free users just create value through the network effect for paying users. The model can work if enough people join. Recently, they have gone from significant overvalued against analyst consensus to significantly undervalued. Its selling at half the PE ratio of Match. Revenue per user declined, and total revenue did not meet expectations, but earnings per share is still projected to grow by 40. Its clearly in a downtrend, but it may be oversold at this point.

Yahoo,2024-08-08,"Dating apps have become junk since many years ago.  Bumble is the worst of them because it was just a copy of Tinder masquerading as something new and unique.  In the end, Bumble capitulated and basically became exactly like a more expensive version of Tinder after giving men the option to pay to message women first.  Welcome to Tinder with extra steps!  lolBoth apps entered into microtransaction mode.  Pay for this, pay for that, etc.  They catered to women and only a select, tiny subset of successful men who received the vast majority of matches while the average man received no attention as the algorithms pushed average men to the back of the deck.  Dating apps intentionally skew your matches to minimize your chances of actually meeting someone.Countless bot/fake female accounts, IG promoter ghost accounts, OF promoter accounts, etc.  Men are turning their backs to dating apps that waste their time and take their money.  When the men leave, so does the revenue.  Internet dating is hitting a major snag and it will not change until behaviour changes.  And that will take a lot of time.Stop treating men like trash and start catering to actually helping people.  Then maybe men will return.",Neutral,0,0.9678416848182678,Main
