NVDA... i kept feeling like i missed the train. my only NVDA play was a put. And for those wanting a column for puts or calls i just put parentheses on the tickers that i bought puts on 2. i only exercised a big AAPL and a big WULF one on accident because i forgot about the exp date. i sold the next day because it basically drained all of my cash. so essentially same gains as if i just sold to close the calls. 3. Hot damn.. enough on the colors. i added it last min and didnt even think about your tiny brains not being able to just spot a trend and ignore the color yellow for 5 seconds 4. in terms of strategy... a lot of these losers are from stupid DD posts on this thread. most of the winners are just from me thinking a stock got unfairly beat up after a piece of news. like the LOGI calls for 405 were just because the stock tanked after the submarine imploded. the media blamed a logitech controller and i thought that was regarded so i bought short term calls back to their average and it printed prettty quick 69 days 5. i have owned a bunch of stocks for a long time and didnt want to show total portfolio value because it sort of takes away from only the options activity. have roughly 650k in the market right now and try not to have more than 30k in options exposure at any given time. 6. Lastly... i just let the losers run to expiration because im hoping for big news and then i forget to sell them. For the winners, i lost out a lot on being greedy but many times when its over 100 i will take out my investment and just roll with the house money. most of the time these 100 positions were up considerably well before exp and i was too greedy to sell and take some money off the table. Hope that helps or explains some of the questions ive been getting !imgemotet5_2th524276"

Instead of realizing a normal investors 20 gains over the period, you have realized 91 gains while at the same time adding a ton of downside potential which thankfully you avoided. Seems like a solid strategy to be honest if you were looking for more risk more reward. But at the end of the day it isnt sustainable and you should quit and put the balance into VOO or something. You show good bankroll management skills based on the risk you are putting out there at least. The problem is if you only put 5 of your money at risk the other 95 is sitting in money market account and those rates are dropping tremendously now and into the future. So I would take a strategy of 95 of the funds sitting in voo, taking 5 out at a time for options plays."

Women and attractive men do not make these companies a lot of money since they can for the most part get the full value out of the app without paying for any of the premium features. The amount of young sexless men will increase, everyone knows that gen Z is so far the least social generation in history. A lot of them dont have any hobbies, dont have any friends to out with or meet people through, and dont go to barsclubsevents. That leaves them with little options to satisfy their sexual urges, porn or apps. Apps are the closest shot to getting anything, which is close to 0, which is why so many of these men gravitate towards it. TLDR Dudes are desperate and horny, OP is probably regarded, and Bumble as a company sucks, but the stock could do something like go up."

Then bumble has girls making the first move, me and you know girls hate to make the first move because they rather want to be chased.. the only dating app thats somewhat successful now is Hinge, and theyre making the app worse now and way more expensive.

Revenue per user declined, and total revenue did not meet expectations, but earnings per share is still projected to grow by 40. Its clearly in a downtrend, but it may be oversold at this point. If the price declines to 5.50 from 5.95, its probably a buying opportunity, if it isnt already. The most pessimistic analyst of 17 has set a target of 5.50.

My sentiment and understanding is the RESULT of those now well understood habits. I did not drive women away on Bumble cuz I wrote a mini rant in fact i often wrote very little It has to do with very very basic reality. If a woman likes u, she will give you her numberemailsnapchatinstagram or other contact info within the first few messages that are sent. If she is mostly uninterested, she wont. Its as simple as that There are certain websites that have monetized the first message. Those sites are doing very well I would say Unless the first few interactions or messages are monetized it is extremely difficult to build a consistent stream of revenue for a dating app. Why would average looking men PAY to send messages knowing that women are still likely to read those messages and remain uninterested in them? Tell me, why on earth would they do that?"

When I switched to Hinge I met so many women that I couldnt keep up with convos and dates. The reason? I used the prompt response DM slide feature on Hinge to break the ice and start convos. Bumble is very restrictive in comparison and doesnt serve straight men at all. I tell all single men to boycott Bumble. Congrats on a 6 bagger OP. Oh and FUUUUUCK YOU."

Who would have thought that when you charge for membership and limit interactions with only women allowing to initiate contact, the entire business plan goes to hell because said target demographic doesn&#39;t want to pay nor get rejected like Men do.  I guess equality goes out the window when it doesn&#39;t suit them.  I&#39;m glad I found my loving wife many years ago and not to have to endure today&#39;s modern dating scene."

In the end, Bumble capitulated and basically became exactly like a more expensive version of Tinder after giving men the option to pay to message women first.  Welcome to Tinder with extra steps!  lolBoth apps entered into microtransaction mode.  Pay for this, pay for that, etc.  They catered to women and only a select, tiny subset of successful men who received the vast majority of matches while the average man received no attention as the algorithms pushed average men to the back of the deck.  Dating apps intentionally skew your matches to minimize your chances of actually meeting someone.Countless bot/fake female accounts, IG promoter ghost accounts, OF promoter accounts, etc.  Men are turning their backs to dating apps that waste their time and take their money.  When the men leave, so does the revenue.  Internet dating is hitting a major snag and it will not change until behaviour changes.  And that will take a lot of time.Stop treating men like trash and start catering to actually helping people.  Then maybe men will return."

For short positions, if the spread divided by the sale price of the stock is u, and you are trading with a leverage of L, it&#39;s optimal to close and reopen at every drop in the sale price of the stock of v times the sale price, where v is given by:v = sqrt[2 u/(L + 1)] + (4 L - 1)/[3 (L + 1)] u + terms of order u^(3/2) and higher that we can ignore.This is the way I&#39;m currently trading my shorts for the VIX and many other shorts. In my case v is typically 4%. I then calculate beforehand what the value of the closed position will be at the take profit point. The positions are all opened at 5 times leverage but the leverage is then lowered by adding collateral which makes the leverage about 1.5. This then means that I need to take the total value of the position and multiply that by 1.5, which gives me the exposure of the future position I want to open. That position will be opened at a leverage of 5, so I divide that exposure by 5. I can then set an order for opening that position at the desired point for that amount at a leverage of 5. And as soon as that order is executed, I can then add the amount of collateral needed to move the stop loss away so that it becomes a leverage 1.5 position. If the order is executed at exactly the right point, then the total amount of money in the position, including the collateral will be exactly the value of the old position at closure."
