Trump is an isolationist that has and will do all he can to punish global trade and global order, as well as the notion of the rule of international law. Trump’s policies could make it difficult or impossible for companies like Innodata to conduct their international business, and prohibitively expensive to do so. Tax exposure to wealthy Americans will return, slowly, to pre-Trumpian levels. That’s a fact with Harris or any other Democrat. Harris will also appoint competent judiciary to further the rule of law and Trump would appoint incompetent loyalists to gut our legal system. Trump would also gut the regulatory branches of government, including the SEC, making it highly likely that shorts and other nefarious forces would further rig the system making it impossible for moms and pops like us to get a fair shake and make any money in the markets. Period. Harris believes in strengthening regulation and would do all she could to level the playing field to the benefit of all of us here."

So, an INOD investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects INOD the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for INOD. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

I say this as respectfully as possible, kindly next pull up the one year chart, this was $6 a few months ago. No one in their right mind thought or thinks that the base is $20 here. No way. This is a fast mover, in both directions, and the float is very low (thank you Jack for being frugal and disciplined over the last two decades). That&#39;s the reason there are a lot of momentum traders, this stock has legs. I believe the future is bright. I wasn&#39;t so certain two quarters ago, but I&#39;m more confident today than at any time in the past two decades. A handful of folks have taken some profits, which should never be criticized. The profit takers may slightly exceed the accumulators, and that will move the needle. Why take profits now? Because some are wary about the ramping up costs and potential paucity of profits in the near term. They also may perceive a softening in the AI sector and revision of some of the larger orders. Those folks are likely to continue to follow, and may re-enter at higher bases when the future is clearer. I&#39;m not concerned, as I don&#39;t foresee a high likelihood of any negative catalysts on the horizon at the moment. Maybe a hit piece or two, but I trust that Jack will be much more proactive in combatting same."

The broad trading range and high volatility/high beta looks like ongoing opportunity for the momentum traders, some of whom get impatient when behind in a trade. No true long would be unhappy with a trading range of $12 to $24, or so, for the time being. And I see very little chance of this ever dipping back to single digits. Additionally, there is the very real possibility of an upside surprise in the short term, including either a buyout or partnership. I don&#39;t think a sale price of $1B+/- is unreasonable given the uptick in revenue and the prospect of owning, exclusively, a premier high quality data engineering company, which would make for a nice division of any of our Mag 7 clients. Such an announcement could happen momentarily. You&#39;d wake up to $33 or so. Could genuinely happen.  There also is the possibility of an acquisition, which while not without risk, should be exciting for true longs who understand the challenges of exponentially growing a small company to a much larger one. In short, there is no downside that I see for either true longs or momentum traders. This is a place to be. So, Jimbo, I agree with your sentiments. Things are looking good."

Lots of new folks entered on that date and plenty more since then. Many with little DD. People are attracted to movers, especially in the AI category. The majority of these folks are sitting on nice profits. The stock has doubled since they bought even considering today&#39;s present decline. It should surprise no one here that some newbies are taking nice profits. Whether they are wrong or right, whether they have thought it through or not as carefully as some might expect, they are locking in profits. No one should be surprised by this kind of behavior. The purpose of investing is ROI and today&#39;s sellers have nice scores. In turn, others with longer term outlooks are taking advantage of what they believe to be good entry points. This is how the markets work. Fast movers move fast in both directions."

I believe what the market needs to see for the next leg up is more evidence of the capacity to perform and sustain the potential exponential revenue growth and an acquisition of a company like Appen, for example, should now be welcomed by the shareholders who are in this for the long game. It takes money and risk tolerance to grow this into the monster it is capable of becoming. And no one should fault Jack if he decides to sell or partner with someone bigger and more powerful at this point in time as in doing so, he will have put a cherry on top of the recent shareholder value that he has finally delivered.
