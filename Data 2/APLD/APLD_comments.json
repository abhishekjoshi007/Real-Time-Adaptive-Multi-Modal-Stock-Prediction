On that basis alone to me ACHR stock has a lot of run rate.. and given the substantial difference in value currently you might say it has a clear vertical take off in the near to mid term. Another point, 1b value is a rounding error in todays valuation of companies. For a company with a solid heli model out there, full pro staff and, a huge factory buildout in progress and tangible interest with millions already invested and many more committed by blue chip companies and governments of many countries.... 1b is a joke."

Im not dumbass, you just have 0 concept of how derivative markets work. Someone buying 100k calls isnt just going to lift the hard offer the ask. Theyre likely to place a bid, which market makers will then hit. Sure, they all trade on the bid, but someone still bought 100k calls. You dont just lift the hard offer. Well maybe you do, but someone buying 100k calls has a brain. The OI went up 100k overnight, theyre still 0.15b for 15k today the price it traded at yesterday. The calls were bought. Does it mean the stock will go up? Nope. But it certainly doesnt make me a moron, that would be you"

He aims to spearhead operational initiatives that boost productivity and profitability across all divisions, solidifying APLD&#39;s position as a frontrunner in next-generation data center providers. Be it hyperscale, AI, small enterprise, cloud, or even mining, APLD&#39;s goal is to ensure that the services they provide at one location are consistently delivered everywhere. I think that&#39;s really encouraging."

One thing APLD has over CORZ though is that CORZ had a lot more of converted debt to equity holders because they had to give convertibles to just about everyone once they exited Bankruptcy. Just look at their price action once they started announcing their AI/HPC infrastructure deals and their ensuing jumps in share price. It all ended up very well for us CORZ retail shareholders. Because of APLD&#39;s lower float, hopeful that their bounce from announcing hyperscaler is massive."

The topic was Halloween-- not something celebrated in India--at least by his folks. So where did it come from he asks. And I say some pope way back when co-opted pagan festivals.Turns out Gregory the 3rd back in the 8th century. Yep the Celts celebrated that one day of the year when the veil between the living word and the other side was thinnest with bonfires, feasts and story telling. So now Home Depot sells 12 foot skeletons and lots of candy gets sold and eaten, So a factor in upcoming ers&#39;.What would those Celts and this Pope Gregory think of AI and our data centers. Hopefully just a boo to you&#39;all today and a nice sp recovery-- eh&gt;  Treats no tricks."

Colocation cloud services are likely to be more significant and do not require building data centers. There are other hosting services-- the Marathon leases not tied to hyperscalers.

For example, they can trigger stop losses or limit buy orders. SpoofingMarket makers can place large orders to buy or sell a security with the intent of canceling it before it&#39;s executed. This can create an illusion of high demand or supply, artificially moving prices. Front-runningMarket makers can buy or sell a security knowing that a large order is about to be executed. This gives them an unfair advantage over other market participants. Buying and flippingMarket makers can buy shares for their own accounts and then flip them hours later to make a personal profit. Regulatory bodies aim to prevent market makers from exploiting investors."

Big jump in the current quarter but lots more to come.  Guidance from the annual report was for 100 to 110 millions in revenues from Cloud Services this year.  We are on track to easily surpass that 110 millions based on nearly 30 millions this quarter..  With more to come-- wow.. And better financing on the way.  Keep on trucking ..  very good news and profitable business while we wait for those data centers to kick off the dough."

Todaro acknowledges that while the High-Performance Computing (HPC) lease has yet to be concluded, management has indicated they are nearing completion, attributing the delay to clerical issues. He reasons that even with a longer-than-anticipated timeline, Applied Digital is well-positioned to establish a site before most of its competitors, highlighting that aside from CoreSite Realty Corporation, no other peer has reached a Letter of Intent (LOI) stage."

Given the amount of money raised and the amount of construction progress at Ellendale, one has to feel pretty confident about the deal.  Whether it is a 10 year or a 15 year lease might matter to some degree.  From the little bit of research on the internet, the projected margin matters more-- will it be 50% - 75% or even higher as incredible at that might seem.  And of course the issue of matching funding for Ellendale.  And guidance-- when does the revenue start-- probably already some hefty advanced deposit made,  And when does attention turn to the additional data center sites.Friday&#39;s trading action very puzzling.  Not sure that options alone explains the day.  Or even the new shares--from Nvidia and Related Company.  So what does?  Volume sort of fizzled after the first hour until near the end of the trading day.  Seems to be more or less of a pattern.  Insider Monkey explains new pe buyers when the market goes up.  So are these pe folks sellers as the market drops?  Bots and algos rule-- just the way it is."

The pros take profits when warranted too, so do the hedge funds. B. Riley put an $11.00 price tag on APLD, so there&#39;s plenty of time and room to hold for a lifetime and make good money or selling portions of shares while holding other portions. For you to criticize and call people amateurs is childish, frankly. Other investors/traders strategy for APLD may be different from yours and mine. The ultimate goal is to obviously make money. To each his or her own and I respect whichever strategy works best for other people. You should respect that too."

That cc disclosed much of the information you discuss-- well other than when the lease would be announced.  And as I read your posts, the release date was &#34;implied&#34; not stated.  There is also a newly posted Ellendale 2 building video that provides concrete evidence as to when the facility would be ready.  In the cc  the CEO said late 2024 or early 2025.  So nothing new there in your post,And as to who will sign the lease-- as you said the possibilities are few.  But no name has been released.  Both Amazon and Microsoft have  large presence in the Ellendale area. So up in the air,  You can go back as well to the press release on the letter of intent for more information.  That was posted last July with a note that a final lease was expected in the next 60-90 days.  So again the timeline was revealed but not who.Appreciate your providing more information, even if seems to be speculation at best."

All references to the video have now been scrubbed from the internet. Our discussions of the video clearly rattled APLD management (and likely their legal team). Under SEC rules, any release of material information, whether intentional or inadvertent, must promptly be made public for all to see. We suspect that APLD will have to accelerate publicity of their lease with the hyper-scaler tenant (there are only five: MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META, IBM), We believe the tenant is MSFT in what will be a multi-billion dollar deal. A member of our team copied the video before it was removed. You can view highlights of the video on Elon’s site under the poster name SexyStock Slayer."

The impetus behind Regulation FD is to avoid giving any person an unfair market advantage through selected access to confidential information."

Tried to  recognize that these numbers are one sided-- not reflecting the expense side-- and not complete.  For example  would there be yet another advance data hosting deposit as of August 30?   It is not clear from the 10-k if these advance fees are monthly or other periods.  Past data indicates a quarterly appearance in company data.  And the numbers do not indicate margins or indicate where the funds will be invested."

Company projects income from the 100 mw lease to the unnamed hyperscaler starting end of 2024 or in 2025. 2025 will see another Ellendale Buidling started and possibly a 3rd.On the Cloud Services side-- we know that clusters were more than doubled so far in 2024 but not all were generating income-- with plans for more to be acquired and leased out.There&#39;s a lot of unknowns here but enough clarity to see once again substantial revenue growth in the current year.

Or included consulting and other revenues. Obviously no deductions for expenditures or noncash expenses.So assuming cloud services came in at 25 millions-- cash for the quarter-- nearly $4 per share.

According to the cc, there was 37 million in cash at the end of the quarter.  Another 25 million came in from Garden City and another 155 million came in from loan proceeds.  If my understanding is correct, there&#39;s over 200 millions in the company accounts with this convertible..  Obviously it won&#39;t all go to construction but with a lease signing, we should have the liquidity to reach conventional financing.  So it&#39;s a major step.  But again, the lease signing puts us over the finish line.  Apld is a serious player in the data center world.."

The loss was perhaps larger than anticipated but tied to a power outage, depreciation rules and start up expenses.  Several have mentioned debt issues.  But Apld ended the quarter with 37 millions in cash and at the start of the current quarter received the 25 million earn out for Garden City and another 150 millions in loan proceeds.  So no immediate debt issues-- Jamestown fully funded.  Ellendale 1 accelerated development funded.  Conventional lending sources ready to go with the signing of a lease for Ellendale 1.  Meanwhile Cloud Services are expected to generate 100 millions or so in revenues for the current fiscal year and new financing is being sought for expansion..So Apld in great shape cashwise and ready to get a lease wrapped."
