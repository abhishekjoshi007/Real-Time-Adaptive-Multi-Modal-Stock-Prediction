Cruises troubles can be traced to an Oct. 2 crash when a car hit a woman at an intersection in San Francisco and flung her into the path of one of Cruises driverless taxis. The Cruise car dragged the woman some 20 feet before pulling to the curb, causing severe injuries. Regulators accused Cruise of omitting footage of its car dragging the woman from a video that it provided to state officials."

Looking at your phone or reaching for something will trigger the nag, but its getting better on tracking driver awareness. I still saw some issues with regressions on managing staying in the lane on mountain curves with this update, but most things are far improved. That was a big regression the couple times it happened. I have FSD HW3 which is nearing end of life, but Tesla will be capable of far more advanced computations with HW5 for the robotaxi. While I know my car will never be driverless, Tesla is clawing closer and closer to getting ready for driverless robotaxis. Thats now the direction they are prioritizing over expanding manufacturing facilities. !remindme in 2years, I think they will have robotaxis beginning operations by then, and that will be able to scale up massively."

The point clouds created by Lidar data are precise measures, capable of operating at any level of light, and arent hampered by various sources of noise in the surroundings which can cause problems with cameras, such as lights and the like. Further, stereoscopic measurement is essentially inference IE, not a direct measure of distance or timing, but rather on an inferred model based on parallax and relationships. Lidar will always be more accurate than a camera for the simple fact that Lidar is basically a direct measurement, whereas cameras for such cases are an indirect method. You can get fairly accurate with optical cameras, but never nearly so was with Lidar. Stereoscopic and orthological mapping using cameras is processor heavy far moreso than Lidar point clouds, requires more time for data processing, requires actual light to be present, and can get confused by stray light sources. While both have limitations, particularly in rainy or foggy conditions, these limitations are generally the same. The fundamental issue with cameras for FSD isnt one of data, its one of actual technological and physical limitations which are essentially impossible to overcome."

More important is the actual cost to waymo per ride, including amortization of hardware, software and dev costs. Because that will determine if its actually a viable business model or just another silicon valley solution in search of a problem. My guess is its not. Drivers arent the only cost to a taxi business and do a lot of stuff you take for granted cleaning, arranging servicing and off duty storage etc. Self driving taxis remove the driver cost but then add in a whole bunch of extra costs cleaners, fleet managers etc plus the rather sizable costs of the extra hardware plus software and dev costs. If its viable at all it would only be at huge scale with immense capital costs. With the inevitable low margins its hard to see who that business would appeal to. The benefit to the customer is also marginal. Is your driverless taxi offering your a significantly better service or outcome than a drivered one? No. They both get you to where you want to go for a small amount of money. Thats it. And for cities they will simply make congestion even worse. America doesnt want to hear this but the solution for moving large numbers of people around quickly and cheaply is more public transport and fewer cars of any kind."

Its a bit more apt to say that cameras dont have any particular advantage over Lidar at all aside from cost, and Lidar is a more reliable system overall with fewer fail points to be concerned with. It has some similar limitations in terms of fog and the like, but the biggest difference is that Lidar gives actual distances well, they give actual time between shooting the laser out and reading it, which is innturn calculated to a distance whereas cameras infer distances you have multiple overlapping images that create a 3D model that you can measure in."

Taxis are never going to replace car ownership like some who live in an urban bubble insist, car ownership is way too big of a part of our culture. IMO theres far more lucrative uses for a self driving vehicle that will only be possible once they can safely drive anywhere in the US instead of a few geofenced big city areas, including Replacing truck drivers with self driving vehicles. This alone would probably be at least a 100 billion dollar industry. Combine self driving vehicles with drones to replace delivery vans. Last mile delivery is insanely expensive, self driving vehicles and drones could cut this cost down a lot I imagine. Consumer owned self driving vehicles, sold as a safety andor convenience feature. I cant imagine many people wanting a bunch of strangers to ride in their cars even if it can make them money, but I can definitely imagine people being willing to pay up for their own self driving vehicle that can take them to work while they sleepetc."

While a lot of focus has gone onto Cruise vehicles reckless driving like running red lights, crashing into an emergency vehicle, its been under reported just how dangerous Waymos vehicles are. Waymos vehicles are much more likely to get into car accidents then the average driver, but the thing is Waymo tends to get into accidents because their vehicle is too cautious. i.e. it suddenly slams on its breaks for nonexistent obstacles, or things that a human driver wouldnt stop for, which causes the person behind them to hit them because they arent expecting a car to suddenly slam on its breaks when no one is crossing the street, and theres no traffic, stop signs, or red lights ahead."

Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 510 of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publiclytraded company in the world thats interesting enough for me. All of the individual stocks sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. Im a member of the Triple Nine Society, but Im not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I dont."

They are involvedplugged in with googles waymo self driving cars, have their freight operation although was getting some bad feedback for awhile, but seems like they are solving problems internally and externally in that arena and at some point will be handling automated transports, are connected with future and ready for evtols which should greatly impact people and goods transportation. Netflix is a great company, solid stats though and honestly havent researched them enough to know how bright their future looks. I think potential exists if they can expand beyond the standard platform hosting showsvideo game content and get into maybe some of the virtual reality and ai generated content space with users maybe? But my opinion fwiw is that Uber has a lot of room to grow profits as a logistics broker that is forward leaning and visionary."

The risk is higher but the expected returns are not. Since theres no benefit to taking such risk, its unnecessary, as I mentioned in my previous reply. Imagine that I offer to give you some money. The amount I give you will depend on what happens when you flip a coin. You can either flip the coin once for 10,000 or you can flip it 100 times for 100 each time. Either way, the expected return is 5,000. The single flip is very risky because theres a 50 chance youll win nothing. Uncompensated risk. The 100 flips are a lot safer because youre pretty likely to get about 5000. BTW, investing in stocks instead of saving in a HYSA, etc. is a compensated risk. Risks are higher but so are expected returns."

Now ur back at even and u say to urself Im still even ill just hold...weeksmonths pass and now ur down 1020 and u start to get nervous and that sinking feeling in ur stomach and decide to sell at a loss loosing 30k. Situation 2 u make money and book a big profit and suddenly think your nostradomous and can repeat it again with another stock so u do it again except it doesnt have the same outcomes and u loose big.

What stands out and is very alarming is how desperate Lyft has been trying to inflate driver pay on their app to lure drivers to take the ride. As I said many times before on this board, Lyft and Uber are nothing without drivers. They both live off of drivers back. Uber had tried much harder than Lyft to diversify their business. I don’t think Lyft business model is sustainable. Unless the CEO strikes some deal or the board bring in a new and visionary fresh mind to run the company, Lyft will go down and possibly fold in the next 2 years or less."

So, a LYFT investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects LYFT the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors. All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for LYFT. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects LYFT) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of LYFT to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

So, an LYFT investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects LYFT the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for LYFT. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

By recruiting drivers without stable jobs and paying minimal wages, they disrupt the working class and perpetuate poverty. \n\nTheir profit models prioritize earnings over people, relying on: \n\n- Withholding driver earnings\n- Skimming toll road pennies\n- Charging exorbitant rider fees (e.g., Uber&#39;s $1.25 and Lyft&#39;s $0.85 per transaction) \n\nLack of transparency and accountability is alarming, particularly with Lyft&#39;s claimed 2.5 million daily riders and 30% profit margin before expenses. This raises questions about operational costs and profit margins, and whether their board properly scrutinizes numbers. \n\nThe use of AI-powered apps instead of human representatives also raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the push for automated self-driving cars or robotaxis seems more like a marketing ploy to attract uninformed investors. \n\nLet&#39;s consider the airline industry, which has the technical capability to automate but still values human pilots for consumer comfort and trust. Similarly, would you feel comfortable riding a robotaxi on the highway, surrounded by reckless drivers? I&#39;ll believe in autonomous transportation when Disney allows software to operate the monorail without a human operator."

LYFT boasts to the drivers that they are getting 70% of the fare after the &#34;Estimated Expenses&#34; and LYFT FEES. What intrigues me is why the company has so much debt?

If Lyft had been focusing on maximizing revenue at the expense of profit, their revenue would be higher than their market cap while Uber appears to have a market cap almost 4 times revenue. I think Lyft could easily move into the 20s or even 30s in the next 6-12 months if they can sustain profitability and increase revenue by 20-30%. Not all that big a &#34;lyft&#34;, so I think they can do it. Interest rate cuts should help as well as long as the economy doesn&#39;t go into recession."

That never bodes well for investors.  The question is, what is the catalyst in the months to come to move this stock north again?  Flat revenue quarter over quarter won&#39;t do it, and that&#39;s what they signaled today from Q2 to Q3.  It&#39;s disappointing, as after the investor day in early June mgmt just disappeared.  LFYT when never compare to UBER, but something needs to change to move the needle here.  Just not sure what it is, and I don&#39;t see a buyout coming anywhere on the horizon."
