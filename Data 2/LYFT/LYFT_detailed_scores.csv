Reddit,2024-10-23,"Waymo in its current form is massively unprofitable. You cant just scale up their numbers and assume they become a 6T company, because theyd literally go bankrupt from the trillions of dollars in losses it would take to operate that size of a fleet. Their retrofitted cars cost something like 180k when they need to ideally be under 40k for the payoff to make any sense. That isnt going to happen next year. Probably not for a decade. Not to mention Waymo rides are currently more expensive than a comparable Uber or Lyft ride.

I have FSD HW3 which is nearing end of life, but Tesla will be capable of far more advanced computations with HW5 for the robotaxi.

Reddit,2024-10-07,"There technical limitations to using cameras that go beyond needs more data. The point clouds created by Lidar data are precise measures, capable of operating at any level of light, and arent hampered by various sources of noise in the surroundings which can cause problems with cameras, such as lights and the like. Further, stereoscopic measurement is essentially inference IE, not a direct measure of distance or timing, but rather on an inferred model based on parallax and relationships. Lidar will always be more accurate than a camera for the simple fact that Lidar is basically a direct measurement, whereas cameras for such cases are an indirect method. You can get fairly accurate with optical cameras, but never nearly so was with Lidar. Stereoscopic and orthological mapping using cameras is processor heavy far moreso than Lidar point clouds, requires more time for data processing, requires actual light to be present, and can get confused by stray light sources. While both have limitations, particularly in rainy or foggy conditions, these limitations are generally the same. The fundamental issue with cameras for FSD isnt one of data, its one of actual technological and physical limitations which are essentially impossible to overcome.",Neutral,0,0.9956825971603394,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-07,"Kind of irrelevant atm, theyre running it as a tech demonstration not a business. More important is the actual cost to waymo per ride, including amortization of hardware, software and dev costs. Because that will determine if its actually a viable business model or just another silicon valley solution in search of a problem. My guess is its not. Drivers arent the only cost to a taxi business and do a lot of stuff you take for granted cleaning, arranging servicing and off duty storage etc. Self driving taxis remove the driver cost but then add in a whole bunch of extra costs cleaners, fleet managers etc plus the rather sizable costs of the extra hardware plus software and dev costs. If its viable at all it would only be at huge scale with immense capital costs. With the inevitable low margins its hard to see who that business would appeal to. The benefit to the customer is also marginal. Is your driverless taxi offering your a significantly better service or outcome than a drivered one? No. They both get you to where you want to go for a small amount of money. Thats it. And for cities they will simply make congestion even worse.

Reddit,2024-10-07,"Lidar works in lowlight conditions, and is more or less a direct measure of distance. Optical methods with cameras perform poorly in low light conditions, and require orthological modeling to determine distance. A lot more can go wrong with optical cameras than Lidar in determining distances due to the far, far more strenuous processing requirements of optical systems that also tend to be far less accurate. Its a bit more apt to say that cameras dont have any particular advantage over Lidar at all aside from cost, and Lidar is a more reliable system overall with fewer fail points to be concerned with. It has some similar limitations in terms of fog and the like, but the biggest difference is that Lidar gives actual distances well, they give actual time between shooting the laser out and reading it, which is innturn calculated to a distance whereas cameras infer distances you have multiple overlapping images that create a 3D model that you can measure in.",Negative,-1,0.842420220375061,Reply

I dont think its that big of an issue atm and believe waymo will find solutions to improve security, but time will tell.

While a lot of focus has gone onto Cruise vehicles reckless driving like running red lights, crashing into an emergency vehicle, its been under reported just how dangerous Waymos vehicles are. Waymos vehicles are much more likely to get into car accidents then the average driver, but the thing is Waymo tends to get into accidents because their vehicle is too cautious. i.e. it suddenly slams on its breaks for nonexistent obstacles, or things that a human driver wouldnt stop for, which causes the person behind them to hit them because they arent expecting a car to suddenly slam on its breaks when no one is crossing the street, and theres no traffic, stop signs, or red lights ahead.",Negative,-1,0.5337791442871094,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-17,Gambling with 75 of ur total portfolio is incredibly stupid. Not only are u 75 exposed to one company but also to a stock thats done nothing but bleed out since ipo. There are two outcomes to your situation as I compare what your doing to gambling. Situation 1....your up 10 now in the positive and feeling that high so u continue to hold hoping for that 10 to turn into 20 30 40 100 etc. Maybe it goes up a bit mo4e from her3 but then starts to fall back and bleed if the sp starts to reverse again. Now ur back at even and u say to urself Im still even ill just hold...weeksmonths pass and now ur down 1020 and u start to get nervous and that sinking feeling in ur stomach and decide to sell at a loss loosing 30k. Situation 2 u make money and book a big profit and suddenly think your nostradomous and can repeat it again with another stock so u do it again except it doesnt have the same outcomes and u loose big. Investing is a slow patient game doing what your doing is just Goin to get u addicted to gambling with your portfolio and when it comes to gambling a big win is far more dangerous then a big loss.,Negative,-1,0.5823458433151245,Reply

Yahoo,2024-09-11,"The rise of Uber and Lyft has revealed weaknesses in government oversight, enabling these companies to exploit loopholes and disregard unemployment concerns. By recruiting drivers without stable jobs and paying minimal wages, they disrupt the working class and perpetuate poverty. 

Their profit models prioritize earnings over people, relying on: 

- Withholding driver earnings
- Skimming toll road pennies
- Charging exorbitant rider fees (e.g., Uber&#39;s $1.25 and Lyft&#39;s $0.85 per transaction) 

Lack of transparency and accountability is alarming, particularly with Lyft&#39;s claimed 2.5 million daily riders and 30% profit margin before expenses. This raises questions about operational costs and profit margins, and whether their board properly scrutinizes numbers. 

The use of AI-powered apps instead of human representatives also raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the push for automated self-driving cars or robotaxis seems more like a marketing ploy to attract uninformed investors. 

Let&#39;s consider the airline industry, which has the technical capability to automate but still values human pilots for consumer comfort and trust. Similarly, would you feel comfortable riding a robotaxi on the highway, surrounded by reckless drivers?
