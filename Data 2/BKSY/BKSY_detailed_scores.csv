BKSY announce they’re issuing 10 million new shares of stock (+/-15% of float). What happens next? BKSY drops 50% on the news.

This by itself doesn’t make any sense. The math doesn’t support the 50% drop on a 15% share dilution. By itself this is a massive overreaction.

But when you add the $46m they made on the offering AND the 2 new contacts signed since then… The math is not in favor of the bears here.

Yahoo,2024-09-05,"RS only relevant to investor sentiment. Clearly worsens sentiment. Sentiment was already terrible. Now we&#39;ll see how bad it can get. Based on market cap (ultimately more relevant stat than stock price), investors have little faith in this company&#39;s business model, short term mid term or long term. And that&#39;s been the case for a LONG time. I have no idea where the bottom is for SP or market cap. But if revenue and margin trends continue and management is to be believed (questionable given how they marketed the SPAC), profitability is not actually very far away for this company. And then things could &#34;rocket&#34; from there. But in the meantime, stock price will languish (RS or not) until the company show&#39;s an actual profit and it becomes crystal clear that further dilution is unnecessary. Also need better visibility into EV/ ROI of the capital investments and sustainability of business model overall.  I have no deep understanding of their competitive position within their industry but they seem like they&#39;ve gotten long term contracts so revenues should be relatively stable at least for the next few years. Fact is, company could have diluted with or with out the RS. On the plus side, mrq and 12 month trailing free cash flow is &#34;not that bad&#34; relative to their cash position and revenue growth so MAYBE they can avoid further dilution.
