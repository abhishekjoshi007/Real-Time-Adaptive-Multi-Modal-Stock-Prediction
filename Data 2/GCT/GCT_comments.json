Please keep posting when you can. \n\nRegarding put options, what would you like to know?  GCT options are traded monthly, and the expiration of options is every third Friday of the month. If you buy a put at a certain strike price, you have the right to sell the stock at the strike price to who sold you the put. However, if you sell a put, the one who bought it has the right to sell the stock to you at the strike price. Generally, such actions are taken on the day of option expiration, and it can be done up to either 5:00 or 6:00 PM on the day of expiration (note, this is 1 or 2 hours after the market closes). \n\nPeople buy puts for two reasons.  First, if they believe the stock will go down and if so, they will make money. They don’t have to put up too much money for it. Therefore, the percent return can be significantly higher than from stock sale/purchase. They can close the position whenever they wish. Second, as a hedge for the stocks they own. People also can sell a put, if they wish to buy a stock only at a certain price below the actual stock price. If the stock goes below the strike price, they will end up buying the stock at the strike price. If the stock remains above the strike price, they will pocket the premium they received when they sold the put."

I&#39;ve not done options but I know today is the expiration date for Oct so I would be curious to hear anyone&#39;s thoughts on today&#39;s action relative to the expiring options. I also noted a significant drawdown on the Short Borrow Availability so it seems the shorts borrowed 450,000 on the lite market (so far) to fight the increasing price. My guess is without their manipulation the price would be up a lot more. I guess the dark pool for today will be reported tomorrow(?) and that&#39;ll be interesting."

It&#39;s given back about 20% of the gain since 15.61, that puts it in buy territory based on the fib. It&#39;s a consumer discrectionary stock and it&#39;s in the Russell. Tom Lee is overweight on that sector and that index. None of this makes it a fool proof bet but the odds are certainly it it&#39;s favor. There could easily be a short squeeze. If Harris gets in, and earnings + guidance are close to what I &#34;expect per my prior notes&#34; then the squeeze should happen by late November. Time will tell.

Keep in mind they already had 5 of the 13 weeks behind them before making that estimate so seems to me that range is a gimmie. Seeking Alpha shows $280.7 million. I assume that is from the 6 wall street analyst. Looking at their 2022, 2023 and 2024 results, Y/Y Q3 has been higher than Q2 both years. If that holds this year then Q3 revenue will top $310.9. Looks high at first glance but doable imo because Q3 2023 predates Noble and the new warehousing space. Personally I&#39;m thinking it could be a significant beat of the 280.7. Over $300 million in revenue. What do you think?"

What’s significant, a reduction of 1,000,000 shares or more imo. Even a reduction of 1,000,000 leaves the shorts with a considerable position."

Frankly, the shorts continue to surprise me as to what they do on GCT and why they do it because try as I might to understand the bear case it just lacks reasoning. There are bear related issues but these are far offset by the bull case. I “think” the shorts find it easy to manipulate GCT because its had low volume (relatively) and trading was mostly retail investors (not institutions). Some institutions bought in when GCT went into the Russell 2000 but those were a passive buys and had no impact on the share price. The one wild card could be Trump&#39;s across the board tariffs should he win. If that happens the cost of furniture will rise substantially but GCT could also manufacture in the US, I believe they already manufacture in the US but I don’t have numbers on volume. We&#39;ll get an update on the shorts Thursday next week. Jim usually posts those numbers. Enjoy your weekend."

I also think the companies with a 33.9 PE is way too high for this business however, the implication of your point is still valid, GCT remains way under valued at $28. Let me add the following: &#34;PEG Ratio (5 yr expected) 0.37&#34; (from Yahoo finance) - anything under 1 is undervalued (reference One up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch for more details and a great read btw). So, let&#39;s assume that PEG ratio was calculated based on yesterdays close. That implies a true value of $70.83. For the record, I am not saying that $70.83 is my expected price target. However, the average target of Wall Street oer Seeking Alpha is $52.15. I believe that number is very reasonable in that it is conservative and achievable. Everyone has to decide for themselves, I&#39;m just laying out my thoughts in detail because there&#39;s been so many bearish comments that are never backed up with fact but folks get afraid and sell at a loss and that just goes against what I believe in.

GCT&#39;s has had high double digit sales growth since Dec 2020 (maybe longer - I only looked back that far). GCT has grown it&#39;s Y/Y gross profit by trible digits each quarter since June 2023. Annual Operating Revenue has increased 343% since 2021. GCT has set aside $46 million to buy back shares to support the price starting Oct 1 2024. The short reports have been refuted by several source - (look through my prior threads for those details). Good luck pioneer"

Short Borrow Availability went down to 1000 today and the FINRA Dark Pool volume was above average yesterday and Tuesday. The shorts are doing their best to slow the increase down, but they are low on powder and the share price will likely be flat to positive today despite their efforts. If they were not working hard to suppress the price GCT would be above the 200-day already. I think the shorts are fighting a losing battle. Time will tell."

It just seems there should be some real punishment in the works for the shorts that refuse to cover now, when the short party is obviously coming to a close."

If that comes to pass the long term technical will have been triggered and we will just need confirmation to follow next week. I &#34;believe&#34; that would give GCT a clear path to $45 at the Q3 earnings release and assuming the Q3 release comes together as expected (i.e. a beat on guidance + improved OI margin + good Q4 guidance) I think $52 (approx.) is possible within the Christmas rally time period. Good luck everyone, I hope you all make a ton on this stock. More importantly, what do you think?"

It&#39;s a deep dive into accounting regulations and website traffic and related companies and it&#39;s the best article I&#39;ve read on this company. Before reading the article I had already independently confirmed the website traffic of GCT and that Griz misrepresented the numbers in their short report or were for some reason confused by the data and had reached an erroneous conclusion. Beyond that, Fuller writes about FASB 606 which concerns how the company recognizes revenue and that since it is a &#34;principal&#34; as defined by 606 it needs to include shipping costs in Gross revenues, and they also deduct that in the COGS. Bottomline is such a practice is not fraud, it&#39;s required so again the folks at Griz seem to lack FASB knowledge since their report reached the wrong conclusion. The related parties are a little more difficult to get absolute evidence but Fuller notes that the companies that Griz claims are omitted from related parties are legacy companies dating back to when the company was in retail, but the company is not in that business now and so their existence is not relevant to GCT. Fuller notes other issues, insider sales and the company&#39;s transition process to a US audit firm is a WIP at this time for reasons noted by Fuller. Fuller notes his target is $50 which is lower than mine. You should read Fuller&#39;s article whether your short or long!"

On Feb 27, 2024, the availability was about 2.7 million shares. It&#39;s possible the shorts are rebalancing a little but it&#39;s also possible they&#39;ve been so successful they need not carry that many shares to short. I still think the shorts will unwind at least some of their position prior to Oct 1 to avoid competing with the company as it begins to defend the stock. Keep Oct 8th in mind because that is when we&#39;ll see the short positions as of Sept 30. I&#39;d be interested in your thoughts on this."

GCT has $200 million in cash. It&#39;s market cap is currently $756 million, so 26% of the market cap is pure cash. That&#39;s a dreamy number by any standard. Compared to RH&#39;s market of $6.4 billion and total cash of $78 million, cash is 1.2 percent of market cap.

All facts point to this being a 5 dollar stock, if it remains a stock and doesn&#39;t get shut down completely.\n\nThey are actually registered in the cayman Islands, no part of this company is american.  and thus isn&#39;t really a company at all as I&#39;ve said.\n\nAll they do is sell stuff on Amazon and ship from China or dropship from another company and squeeze a bit of profit.  If you have experience in this type of think, you would realize the problems you can run into and also the huge possibility for complete fraud.\n\nBeing a publicly traded company on the US markets, there are major problems here.  When this company talks of sales on their Gigacloud Marketplace, they mean on Amazon.  there is no gigacloud marketplace.  Huge misrepresentation.  Also, as a seller on Amazon, they don&#39;t do any sales under their own name.  As I&#39;ve mentioned they have hundreds of Amazon accounts being run by former and current employees, which all feed money back to GCT.  This is ripe for all kinds of problems, not to mention violating every Amazon policy for sellers on the platform.\n\nAnd AI?  really you went there?  If by AI you mean some type of automated software to keep all this chaos somewhat in check the sure, big AI.\n\nHonestly there is no such thing as AI, but that is a whole different topic for which I don&#39;t need to speak about in regards to GCT.\n\nGo read The Grizzly Report about GCT.  Normally I detest short sellers doing deep dove reporting on a company because they also have agenda to make the stock go down, but in this case they are spot on and even missed a fee things because they don&#39;t understand how these companies work and are tied together."

Amazon can ship anything so I don&#39;t know what you mean.  Thus is not a logistics company in anyway.  it&#39;s not B2B in anyway. \n\nMy point is this company is a shell of other shells.  There are a number of things fraudulent here and all of it undisclosed and like a cat and mouse game.\n\nI will not continue to s post of this board, I just feel bad for all the seemingly naive people posting here compete falsehoods and hoping the stick will go up...it won&#39;t.\n\nfull disclosure I own put options on GCT and would not think about closing them until the 5-10 range.\n\nFor 20 years I ran a very successful business through Amazon and other platforms, so I&#39;m well aware of what GCT is and isn&#39;t.  pretty much everything they represent themselves as is a lie.  There have been deep dive reports into this company and everything is out in the open for people if the just research a bit.\n\nEverything else you said is conforming what I said.  If you want to pay 6x of their, in my opinion, pumped fake earnings, for a Chinese  Amazon reseller, then go right ahead.\n\nI just want other to be aware of what they are buying.  It&#39;s definitely not comparable to RH or anything close to it and it&#39;s definitely never going to be the next Amazon, as people have foolishly said.\n\nI mean they don&#39;t even do any business directly, it&#39;s all 3rd party platform and from inviduals running seller accounts under the web of GCT.  there are so many things wrong here that so many aren&#39;t apparently aware of that it&#39;s really sad.\n\nAnyway, good luck"

This distributors doors were also made in China. When you know the ridiculous markups made by US distributors for the same product, you appreciate a company like gct. It really helps to have a staff that speaks Chinese when you are dealing with China and other foreign nations since we as a nation, basically, only speak one language, our own"

I think there may also be a possibility that the shorts could become longs since they know the company very well at this point and they themselves have controlled the price for several months. They pushed it as low as they could, now take profit and use that profit to gain pushing it up. They also know lower rates increase housing sales and higher housing sales increase furniture and large ticket items that have a competitive price point."

Bad enough that Zacks was promoting this stock as a &#34;can&#39;t miss&#34; for months and now says &#34;SELL&#34; and that new investors should avoid this stock. My average is in the low 20&#39;s so I will probably buy more at $11 to average down but not until then as this is painful to watch."

At this point, I could probably write a book on this company but let me just say a few things: I think the company should do on the PR front, it has to continue with good growth and it needs to improve it&#39;s margins. Beyond that, the buy back plan doesn&#39;t start till after Sept 30 (I&#39;m unclear if that means after they release Q3 earnings but for now I assume it means they can start buying Oct 1. That means the shorts will control this stock till at least Sept 30. Selling at the current level seems like a bad idea to me but so far I have been dead wrong on this stock. I&#39;m amazed at how much retail investors hate this stock, it&#39;s emotional and irrational but no one can denie the trend. Anyway, I&#39;m holding. Cheers"

The implication was as margins contract and operational issues are indentifed this could lead to contracting revenues as well. That the separation between revenues and profit and the shrinking margins (mostly the separation between gross profit margin and operating margins are due to undelying business practices and a lack of profitable expansion. Yet if you take the time to look at the financials the business is doing quite well.  it is expanding at a healthy pace and the acquisitions last year will actually improve margins this year and next. Inventory is high but again, once this is sold off margins improve. Lack of SBC activity will really drive margins and this business will look healthy once again. To thos on the fence about holding, I encourage waiting it out one more quarter. In the interestsof transparency, I just picked today to get back in."

GCT is controlled by big money/hedge funds short sellers and their fake news which has scared away the retail investor.  The Grizzly report was fake and statements like the company is headquartered in China, warehouses are empty, financials reported to the SEC are all fake etc.  It will only take one catalyst and the price will go straight up."

The lot sizes of these purchases ranged from a high of 1,204,521 shares (this was BlackRock) to a low of 25,310 shares (this was Seven Eight Capital). I believe that all these purchases occurred on June 28 because total volume on that day jumped to 5,212,900. GCT was put in the Russell 2000 one day later, but it was well known this would happen. To be clear, I do not know with certainty when these institutions purchase GCT. My guess is based on the date of the 13Fs most recent filings as compared to prior 13F filings that are available on Fintel. Additionally, the volume and price of the shares purchased per the F13 is the closing price on June 28. From March 2024 through to June 28, insiders sold 3,624,281 shares. So, institutions have purchased more than 615,076 shares then insiders sold."

I am curious however, and would like to hear your thoughts, as to why the trading volume remains so low and has actually dropped significantly in the last 5 months and why the SP went from $45 in March to $23 (today) if there are &#34;more&#34; institutional investors? Why, even after 3 great earnings reports, and numerous articles from IBD, Zacks, Simply Wall St, InvestorPlace and Motley Fool promoting this stock, does the SP keep falling back? What does it need to get back to just $29 never mind the ALT of $45? If shorts are in control then why would new investors be interested here? The fundamentals &#34;look&#34; strong but something seems &#34;off&#34; if this keeps declining in SP especially after the last three earnings reports beat estimates. Wouldn&#39;t more institutional investors joining bring the SP up instead of it going down? Lastly, what do you think will happen to the SP when more insider trading takes place and when DCM gets back involved here? These are my concerns and questions that are important to me and should be important to any potential new investor and definitely to those who are long here."

Take it for what it is but speaking objectively, this is not a symptom of a company that lost its prospects.

For this she seems like an intermediate level and not yet ready for the CFO on a full time basis - maybe needs a few years as VP. They need a strong, well know CPA with both public and private experiences. Someone who knows analyst and can speak to the analyst with authority. That type of person would quell the rhetoric around the short reports and attract institutional buyers who have seemingly not bought into the growth and profitability of this company. My guess is she knows several people who are qualified to be CFO so hopefully she can attract someone. My biggest concern on this is the CEO is overly frugal and may not be open to the million dollars pay package needed to get the right person. The CEO pays himself $287,000, no other company pays this low."

Re CFO Transition and interim CFO appointment: I think Erica Wei background and location are both better than David&#39;s so that&#39;s some improvement. GCT absolutely needs a strong US CPA certified CFO. I have sent the IR folks emails and on LinkedIn I have sent messages to BoD members on this very issue. Obviously, I feel very strongly on this matter, in the case of GCT, it&#39;s one of the top issues and maybe the most immediate. The company has a credibility problem with the numbers they are reporting. They need to get serious about the accounting staff to have the true value of the company reflected in the price. Cheers"

In his place, Erica Wei, the vice president of finance, will take his place as interim. IMO David has done a great job, and I wish him the best, but I believe this bodes well for GCT’s value. We are possibly one step closer to moving to a US auditor, as Erica resides in the US. One major issue we had with moving to a US auditor is that the current CFO, David Lau, lives in Hong Kong, making KPMG China a more reasonable option for auditor. This is no longer the case, and I expect a US auditor will now be a higher consideration given that Erica lives in California."

I didn&#39;t get any stock-based compensation for that year. But for 2023, I think we delivered pretty impressive financial results. So, I also got compensated for the performance I did for 2023. I think these are the two major factors that to impact the stock based on compensation number you&#39;re seeing.&#34;I post this quote because to me it shows the character of the CEO. This business is personal to him. He is focused on achievements and rewards progress. He does not reward failure (think about how other companies operate - Boeing, Tesla, providing huge rewards without achieving the results to justify such rewards). It&#39;s a character assessment that done remotely and hence far from conclusive, but I tend to trust this CEO more than others because of how he thinks, and he gets results in a business that in total is down year over year. GCT is well positioned for a housing market recovery and has at least 2 more quarters of easier comparative numbers.For me, the Q2-2024 results were amazing. Several negatives such as lower margin percentages and profitability of Noble are all items that have clear explanations and won&#39;t impact long term value. There are more reasons to own this stock then pretty much any other I can find. That&#39;s just my 2 cents."

They do not expect Qtr 3 to be as strong as the season for outdoor furniture declines heavily after June.Cash: M&amp;A activity: Larry discussed they are always interested in adding to their business just as Noble House and Wondersign has done. Also, they are looking to add more warehouse storage within the United States if I heard him correctly.Headwinds: as far as Management goes, Larry Wu had to jump in to answer questions way too often, it did not seem to me that the other 2 on the call could really answer any question effectively, other than spouting what the financial reports said. For example, only 5 sku’s of the Noble House furniture is on the B2B market place, and the team was asked when all sku’s would be available, the question was never answered until Larry stepped in and said that only 30-35% would be made available mainly due to logisticsand available warehouse space."

Here is what I came up with:1) Not sure why lease obligation went up by 47 million. It isn&#39;t really a bad thing but I don&#39;t understand it so it would like them to address it on the call.2) cash only went up by about 12 million which seems very light. 3) AR and Inventory both went up by about 10 million. AR is reasonable given the top line. Inventory seems high to me but I don&#39;t know squat about the details so I could be wrong there. 4) EPS was light, which caused Zacks to say GCT missed their number numbers. That to me is a crazy headline but I suspect a computer wrote it and not an actual person5) top line guidance - this is the biggest negative I can see, but as I pointed out earlier this is consistent with the rest of the market. That said the entire market traded down so I don&#39;t know that it is any real source of comfort for me."

I don&#39;t expect the stock to go up crazy because there is no reason for it to be this low anyway. My point is the same forces that knocked it down this low are likely to persist. Plus, insider selling should begin again the day after tomorrow. Long story short, I do think it will go up but not a ton and I think we have another quarter to wait until we finally work our way through the insider selling issues."

All of them, including big companies like wayfair and amazon, pointed to the fact that the housing market is frozen, with minimal buying due to high prices and high interest rates. Wayfair believes we are approaching the bottom of this cycle, but they are not sure when the rebound will occur. Guidance for these companies was also in line with historical performance, meaning they expect Q3 to be down vs Q2 due to a slowdown in consumer spending associated with the summer months. Opinion: The bad furniture market is not new. It has been this way for the past 2 years and GCT has been able to grow despite it. That said I would be blown away if we exceed guidance this quarter the way we have in the past. I would be really happy with anything north of 265m and getting to 275m would be a gift."

Pumping in the current environment probably won’t help.

Good: Amazon just reported they were losing market share &#34;On the ecommerce front to the likes of Temu and Shein, companies that specialize in low-cost goods that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain.&#34; This is exactly the business GCT is in. Amazon went on to say: “We are seeing cautious consumers. They are looking for deals.” It is worth pointing out that Temu and Shein are not in the furniture market they are in fashion, neither is public, and both are chinese companies. I have no way of knowing which of these two pieces of info is more powerful the good or the bad, so I wanted to share both."

It is fair to point out that a 10day correlation is meaningless as a predictive tool but it is definitely explanatory in hindsight. Yesterday, since the company announced the earnings date, I think we all felt like we were getting a positive bid as a result, but I don&#39;t think that was true. I think we were just benefiting from a good day in tech. Today was the opposite. I think we are doomed to wait for earnings. There just doesn&#39;t seem to be any independent action in the stock right now."

Still another reason I caution investors about GCT is that I have discussed GCT with my Stifel broker who is highly intelligent and experienced.  I am certain that he has a stock portfolio of at least $25,000,000.00.  He studied GCT and told me not to invest in GCT for some of the reasons I have previously posted.  Yes, I could be mistaken.  Earnings are August 6 which in my opinion will be very good.  See what happens to stock price by two weeks after earnings. Will the good earnings be believed.  I don&#39;t think so."
