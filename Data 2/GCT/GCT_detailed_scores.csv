Yahoo,2024-10-19,"Larru, first of all, I really enjoy reading your posts. Thank you for taking the time to do so. Please keep posting when you can. 

Regarding put options, what would you like to know?  GCT options are traded monthly, and the expiration of options is every third Friday of the month. If you buy a put at a certain strike price, you have the right to sell the stock at the strike price to who sold you the put. However, if you sell a put, the one who bought it has the right to sell the stock to you at the strike price. Generally, such actions are taken on the day of option expiration, and it can be done up to either 5:00 or 6:00 PM on the day of expiration (note, this is 1 or 2 hours after the market closes). 

People buy puts for two reasons.  First, if they believe the stock will go down and if so, they will make money. They don’t have to put up too much money for it. Therefore, the percent return can be significantly higher than from stock sale/purchase. They can close the position whenever they wish. Second, as a hedge for the stocks they own. People also can sell a put, if they wish to buy a stock only at a certain price below the actual stock price. If the stock goes below the strike price, they will end up buying the stock at the strike price. If the stock remains above the strike price, they will pocket the premium they received when they sold the put.",Neutral,0,0.9997383952140808,Main

Yahoo,2024-10-01,"There&#39;s an article on Seeking Alpha and GCT called GigaCloud Technologies – Refuting Grizzly Short Seller Claims by Lawrence Fuller. It&#39;s a deep dive into accounting regulations and website traffic and related companies and it&#39;s the best article I&#39;ve read on this company. Before reading the article I had already independently confirmed the website traffic of GCT and that Griz misrepresented the numbers in their short report or were for some reason confused by the data and had reached an erroneous conclusion. Beyond that, Fuller writes about FASB 606 which concerns how the company recognizes revenue and that since it is a &#34;principal&#34; as defined by 606 it needs to include shipping costs in Gross revenues, and they also deduct that in the COGS. Bottomline is such a practice is not fraud, it&#39;s required so again the folks at Griz seem to lack FASB knowledge since their report reached the wrong conclusion. The related parties are a little more difficult to get absolute evidence but Fuller notes that the companies that Griz claims are omitted from related parties are legacy companies dating back to when the company was in retail, but the company is not in that business now and so their existence is not relevant to GCT. Fuller notes other issues, insider sales and the company&#39;s transition process to a US audit firm is a WIP at this time for reasons noted by Fuller.

The implication was as margins contract and operational issues are indentifed this could lead to contracting revenues as well. That the separation between revenues and profit and the shrinking margins (mostly the separation between gross profit margin and operating margins are due to undelying business practices and a lack of profitable expansion. Yet if you take the time to look at the financials the business is doing quite well.  it is expanding at a healthy pace and the acquisitions last year will actually improve margins this year and next. Inventory is high but again, once this is sold off margins improve. Lack of SBC activity will really drive margins and this business will look healthy once again.

Yahoo,2024-08-16,"Hey yz et al, based on my reading of the data on Fintel, a total of 28 institutions (including BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group, Goldman Sachs Inc, Wells Fargo Company, Bank of New York Mellon) purchased a combined total of 4,239,357 shares at a price of $30.42 to $30.43. The lot sizes of these purchases ranged from a high of 1,204,521 shares (this was BlackRock) to a low of 25,310 shares (this was Seven Eight Capital). I believe that all these purchases occurred on June 28 because total volume on that day jumped to 5,212,900. GCT was put in the Russell 2000 one day later, but it was well known this would happen. To be clear, I do not know with certainty when these institutions purchase GCT. My guess is based on the date of the 13Fs most recent filings as compared to prior 13F filings that are available on Fintel. Additionally, the volume and price of the shares purchased per the F13 is the closing price on June 28. From March 2024 through to June 28, insiders sold 3,624,281 shares.

I think these are the two major factors that to impact the stock based on compensation number you&#39;re seeing.&#34;I post this quote because to me it shows the character of the CEO. This business is personal to him. He is focused on achievements and rewards progress. He does not reward failure (think about how other companies operate - Boeing, Tesla, providing huge rewards without achieving the results to justify such rewards). It&#39;s a character assessment that done remotely and hence far from conclusive, but I tend to trust this CEO more than others because of how he thinks, and he gets results in a business that in total is down year over year. GCT is well positioned for a housing market recovery and has at least 2 more quarters of easier comparative numbers.For me, the Q2-2024 results were amazing. Several negatives such as lower margin percentages and profitability of Noble are all items that have clear explanations and won&#39;t impact long term value. There are more reasons to own this stock then pretty much any other I can find. That&#39;s just my 2 cents.",Positive,1,0.9999871253967285,Main

They do not expect Qtr 3 to be as strong as the season for outdoor furniture declines heavily after June.Cash: M&amp;A activity: Larry discussed they are always interested in adding to their business just as Noble House and Wondersign has done. Also, they are looking to add more warehouse storage within the United States if I heard him correctly.Headwinds: as far as Management goes, Larry Wu had to jump in to answer questions way too often, it did not seem to me that the other 2 on the call could really answer any question effectively, other than spouting what the financial reports said. For example, only 5 sku’s of the Noble House furniture is on the B2B market place, and the team was asked when all sku’s would be available, the question was never answered until Larry stepped in and said that only 30-35% would be made available mainly due to logisticsand available warehouse space.",Neutral,0,0.8839125633239746,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-07,"Just to be clear I think the quarter was great but I thought I would ask what might be considered negative. Here is what I came up with:1) Not sure why lease obligation went up by 47 million. It isn&#39;t really a bad thing but I don&#39;t understand it so it would like them to address it on the call.2) cash only went up by about 12 million which seems very light. 3) AR and Inventory both went up by about 10 million. AR is reasonable given the top line. Inventory seems high to me but I don&#39;t know squat about the details so I could be wrong there. 4) EPS was light, which caused Zacks to say GCT missed their number numbers. That to me is a crazy headline but I suspect a computer wrote it and not an actual person5) top line guidance - this is the biggest negative I can see, but as I pointed out earlier this is consistent with the rest of the market.

Yahoo,2024-08-03,"Some more research: The headwinds are very significant. Every company in the BtoC furniture market saw a decline in revenue YOY but an increase from Q1 to Q2. All of them, including big companies like wayfair and amazon, pointed to the fact that the housing market is frozen, with minimal buying due to high prices and high interest rates. Wayfair believes we are approaching the bottom of this cycle, but they are not sure when the rebound will occur. Guidance for these companies was also in line with historical performance, meaning they expect Q3 to be down vs Q2 due to a slowdown in consumer spending associated with the summer months. Opinion: The bad furniture market is not new. It has been this way for the past 2 years and GCT has been able to grow despite it. That said I would be blown away if we exceed guidance this quarter the way we have in the past.

Pumping in the current environment probably won’t help. As the market will be skeptical given others guidance. 

However, if a big beat is reported and they pump, then algos could kick in and look out for the upside.  Best to take profits quickly before Aug skepticism and new insider sales and short seller reports tank psychology again.
