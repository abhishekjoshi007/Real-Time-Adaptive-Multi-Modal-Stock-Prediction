The supply chain is largely fixed and interest rates are now declining, so the biggest headwind for SEDG moving forward is what&#39;s going on in the Middle East, but that&#39;s unlikely to prevent a massive recovery and reversal for SEDG. Stabilization will happen during the next quarter or two and then a big recovery will help SEDG return to profitability, most likely in the next year or so.Right now, the stock is priced for disaster, but when it becomes clear that SEDG will thrive and become profitable again, this has a great shot to be a 3X, 5X, or even a 10X gain.

Yahoo,2024-10-06,"This company and this stock has been through a lot the last couple of years soaring well over $300 a share and dropping below $20 a share. For me, the most important question is what will happen moving forward?SEDG&#39;s difficulties began when interest rates started going up significantly a couple years ago, and while the company could have responded better to that big change, I think it&#39;s now doing just that.Additionally, with interest rates now declining and with the supply chain in better shape than it&#39;s been in some time, I believe that SEDG will start to reduce its losses and return to profitability within 1-2 years. If that happens, I think SEDG will get back to a triple digit share price as it becomes profitable again.The company is cutting expenses while selling off excess inventory, which will help future profit margins once there&#39;s no longer an over-supply of inventory that SEDG needs to sell before bringing in new supply. Demand for solar will continue to increase rapidly, and I very much doubt Israel would let one of its more important companies go under, so there&#39;s powerful support for SEDG long-term. I&#39;m confident it will survive in the short-term and thrive once again in the medium and long term.

Graham is considered the father of value investing and was Warren Buffet&#39;s mentor. He makes a distinction early on in his book between investing and speculating. Most speculators, he says, incorrectly believe they are investors.

If people are anticipating 5 rate cuts in a 12 month period, what would be the rush to install a system on credit that will take a decade or so to pay for itself?And even if you&#39;re betting on rate cuts being a driver, why is SEDG positioned better than any number of other stocks, say those associated with home building or heavy machinery to take advantage of them?",Neutral,0,0.660295844078064,Main
