When the market turns around those investors can make 3 X their investments. Right now it is very very heavily shorted on the Hard to Borrow catagory at many brokerages. When the big boyz called their shares you will see a huge short squeeze too.GL!"

Historically, ENPH has had pretty good leadership (think how they navigated the downturn)...SEDG doesn&#39;t even have a permanent CEO.I think the most likely thing is that SEDG didn&#39;t significantly outperform ENPH this quarter...that a $100M loss isn&#39;t baked into the share price."

It doesn&#39;t have policy opposition (net metering), and it can better take advantage of economies of scale (especially when residential solar needs to be tied to expensive battery backup systems), and deep pockets of utilities are likely to get increasingly behind it.Subsidies always make me a little nervous as it means the rug can be ripped out from underneath a company and there usually isn&#39;t much the company can do in response (cutting costs in low margin operations isn&#39;t often an option), I generally prefer avoiding companies heavily reliant on them as that&#39;s downside that is hard to protect against."

Shorts prioritize making money, not defending a past bad decision to buy a tanking company...All things being equal, listen to shorts, or at least try to understand what they&#39;re thinking when they&#39;re betting against a company. The markets aren&#39;t a battle between longs and shorts, it&#39;s speculation that eventually gets reconciled with company profits or losses... If you think you&#39;re in a battle, you&#39;re fundamentally misunderstanding the game and it&#39;s probably causing you to make more bad decisions."

Since past prices are unlikely to come back, he&#39;s really just buying up shares on the way down, not getting a good deal.If he happens to buy something on its way up, he refuses to buy more over the price he initially paid, so he limits his upside severely while insuring he throws more and more money at stocks going in the wrong direction.He can&#39;t do the math to figure out if what he&#39;s doing works (it&#39;s clearly not), what he loses in lost opportunity and long periods of dead money."

All of these issues impacted their business immensely during the last couple of years. The supply chain is largely fixed and interest rates are now declining, so the biggest headwind for SEDG moving forward is what&#39;s going on in the Middle East, but that&#39;s unlikely to prevent a massive recovery and reversal for SEDG. Stabilization will happen during the next quarter or two and then a big recovery will help SEDG return to profitability, most likely in the next year or so.Right now, the stock is priced for disaster, but when it becomes clear that SEDG will thrive and become profitable again, this has a great shot to be a 3X, 5X, or even a 10X gain. I prefer to add as much as possible now rather than waiting until there&#39;s complete certainty about SEDG&#39;s profitable future by which time the stock will most likely be triple its current price or more."

I missed some potential gains, but the downside of owning it overnight and having it gap way down was too much risk for 25% short term upside...I can see this going to $13 quick, and wherever it finds support, I suspect it will go lower after earnings (even if they beat estimates, guidance for the next few quarters will probably be pretty bad). I might re-evaluate after the call, I&#39;d consider trading the volatility again depending on their runway, but not more than a percent or two of my portfolio."

I also think that lower interest rates will help SEDG a lot, so if we get another good CPI report on Thursday, which I think is likely, I sense SEDG will bounce back into the 20s and hopefully well into the 20s. Longer-term, I&#39;m confident SEDG will become profitable again, and when that happens, I suspect the share price will work its way back toward triple digits."

For me, the most important question is what will happen moving forward?SEDG&#39;s difficulties began when interest rates started going up significantly a couple years ago, and while the company could have responded better to that big change, I think it&#39;s now doing just that.Additionally, with interest rates now declining and with the supply chain in better shape than it&#39;s been in some time, I believe that SEDG will start to reduce its losses and return to profitability within 1-2 years. If that happens, I think SEDG will get back to a triple digit share price as it becomes profitable again.The company is cutting expenses while selling off excess inventory, which will help future profit margins once there&#39;s no longer an over-supply of inventory that SEDG needs to sell before bringing in new supply. Demand for solar will continue to increase rapidly, and I very much doubt Israel would let one of its more important companies go under, so there&#39;s powerful support for SEDG long-term. I&#39;m confident it will survive in the short-term and thrive once again in the medium and long term. Once SEDG demonstrates that, shares won&#39;t be available anywhere near 20, so I&#39;m seizing this moment and opportunity."

Utilities that have portfolios of green energy don&#39;t want to lose market share to residential solar, which right now is pretty reliant on policies (subsidies, net metering, building codes, etc.)... I don&#39;t think Trump can bring back coal that isn&#39;t economical, but I certainly believe he could ensure that residential solar remains out of reach for most Americans ensuring the profits of utilities.Residential solar as a policy issue is difficult for Dems too, as while it provides a societal good by reducing air pollution, putting it on homes doesn&#39;t take advantage of economies of scale and subsidies often seem like tax breaks for people already doing well... Giving rich people money to buy solar arrays or EVs isn&#39;t particularly popular.I think income inequality makes the U.S. a bad market for residential solar in general, unless you can just add it to new construction in markets where an additional $20K doesn&#39;t really mean much, but that&#39;s pretty limiting as far as growing a business..."

Cause let&#39;s say 4-5 rate cuts takes us to March, then people have to get their mortgages, find land, make an offer, have it accepted, go through closing, BUILD A HOUSE when there will probably be tons of other people who have been waiting to do the same thing meaning maybe there&#39;s a shortage of contractors/inspectors, etc. My guess is the average house takes somewhere around 9 months to complete, so the first wave based on the target mortgage rate you put out would be completed around early 2026...Definitely need to buy SEDG today, I mean, how many of their installers are going to go bankrupt owing them money? Or how much money are they going to burn in the meantime?"

Yet, when he makes an obvious error by telling us all that the Fed&#39;s next meeting is in October when it&#39;s actually next week, he refuses to acknowledge his mistakes, but simply changes his original post so that his cluelessness is no longer plain for all to see. He calls others tribal, but does all he can to mock, belittle, and insult others he disagrees with. He seems like a guy who was bullied as a kid and is now lashing out at others. Pretty weak."

Do you remember a couple years ago when Meta went from 400 to less than 90? Would you have been equally critical of Meta then or seen it as an opportunity to buy shares in an extremely oversold company? I chose the latter and am doing so again with SEDG at this crazy low price, though I&#39;m now being a little more cautious with SEDG because the company&#39;s not currently profitable. I think that will change in 2025, and this seems like a great opportunity to double, triple, quadruple, or even quintuple one&#39;s investment in a relatively short time frame. No guarantees in the investing world, but I like this one at this price."

Graham is considered the father of value investing and was Warren Buffet&#39;s mentor. He makes a distinction early on in his book between investing and speculating. Most speculators, he says, incorrectly believe they are investors. To invest, in Graham&#39;s words, is to put capital into something which, &#34;upon thorough analysis promises safety of principle and an adequate return.&#34;Turns out, you&#39;re not an investor."

If people are anticipating 5 rate cuts in a 12 month period, what would be the rush to install a system on credit that will take a decade or so to pay for itself?And even if you&#39;re betting on rate cuts being a driver, why is SEDG positioned better than any number of other stocks, say those associated with home building or heavy machinery to take advantage of them?"

SEDG has 36% short, had a sudden loss of revenue (high interest, NEM 3.0 in CA - reducing solar installations, and installers reducing inventories) and is in the process of recovery now.It is quite possible that shorts are stuck now, and their only way out is keep shorting to suppress stock and hope that weak hands will sell. However, 98% of the float is in the hands of institutions + insiders. If they don&#39;t panic, anything can happen.I am not saying this will go the GME/AMC way, but there is huge similarities in their situations and the environments."

However, when the company revenue and profit situation improves, as it eventually will, this large float % may need to cover (unless their game plan is eventual bankruptcy of the company) this can create a huge short recovery in addition to stock appreciation due to improving fundamentals. This will take 2-3 quarters, but it can be very interesting fireworks."
