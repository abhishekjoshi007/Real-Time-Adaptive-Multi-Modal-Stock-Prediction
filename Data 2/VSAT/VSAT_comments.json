It has to make huge investments up front that take years to bring the money in.  The company made a huge investment in 2023, Sold a large part of their business to finance it.  You will see billion dollar earnings in their fy2023 (march 31,2023) report from the gain on that sell.  Then they leveraged and bought a company called inmarsat and recorded the premium that they paid as intangible.  Then they had a couple of failed satellite launches, one they inherited from inmarsat and another of one of their big satellites viasat-3 f1.  So in 2024 they lost a billion dollars.  They shifted strategy with the loss of the viasat-3 f1 capacity to focus on inflight wifi.  Unfortunately boeing had an accident at the beginning of the year, Airbus has had to ground alot of planes due to a default in their engines, so that business, did not replace the revenues they lost from the na broadband subscription service.  The risk factor here, is the time between the huge capital expenditures to build, test and deploy their large geo satellites and the time when that capacity can be sold.  Lots can change, but alot doesn&#39;t.  think about what a megabit/second capacity is worth in a month, and mutiply that by a2 * 12000000 that will give you a sense of how much their 2 satellites to be launched next year will generate in annual revenue. Then subtract the interest rates on 3 billion dollars of debt."

Has given them an big loss in fy2024.  Understanding the 1 billion dollar earnings in fy2023 and the 1 billion dollars loss in 2024 and the dynamics of how the market changed how it priced viasat will help you gain the courage to make an invesment that will triple within a couple of years.  Of course you can just play the current volatiltiy and hope the music doesn&#39;t stop when there are no empty seats available for you to sit.  The years they lost money since fy2003 -- 2003,2013,2014, 2018,2019,2022,2024.  That means the years they made money: 2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2015,2016,2017,2021,2023In these years they grew their revenue from 185 million dollars to 4.2 billion dollars.  They grew their equity per share from 7. to 40.  IF they had not had those impairments in fy2024, it would be safe to assume the stock would be trading close to 80 per share.  5 years ago before covid hit creating uncertainty in the markets it was trading at 70 dollars per share.  It is a no brainer to own for the long term.  Currently this is a great time to buy.  This is where it is raining gold for folks that have the stomach for it."

I think you have too high a value on vsat, and misinterpret their price as hate.  It is reality.  Before starlink started to dominate the market, they have struggled in providing broadband service to North America.  In that arena, Echostar got their large geo satellite up in the air that they launched back in the summer of 2023.  Viasat didn&#39;t, they had to take a billion dollar write off, and claimed they were going to focus on inflight service instead.  There is no guarantee that they will be successful in that part of the business.  Every single day, Starlink is showing how they will dominate the satellite business.  The problem for me, I can&#39;t invest in starlink.  I can&#39;t read their audited financial statements.  I have nothing to verify if they are indeed winning except the word of elon and the deals mentioned in the press.  I have nothing to verify that viasat&#39;s two satellites will get up in the air in time and provide a service that airlines will want.  Do people want to do video conferencing and business calls while flying.  Do airlines fly as much business.  Are folks on holiday want to be able to stream live the fights that happen on an airplane, or just record it and upload it later.  What is the value of low latency that starlink offers versus the value of  efficient allocation of bandwidth that viasat offers."

Now they will be able to buy back those million shares at a. much lower cost point if they haven&#39;t already.  The name of the game here is to position your holdings at where the stock bottoms out, not hold at above where it peaks. It is kind of a clever strategy, you sell and recognize a nice long term loss that can be applied to future long term gains.  Then with the cash, you wait a while and when the wash rule doesn&#39;t apply, you can buy in at a cheaper price, get the. same number of shares.   Your long term position didn&#39;t change.  You have a tax asset to offset future earnings.  You have extra cash left over to invest someplace else."

But it has never paid a dividend in its history and doesnt need to until it gets to the point where it can&#39;t invest in the business.  It doesn&#39;t need to make a profit for the intrinsic value of the company to increase.  I would refer you to the amortization schedule of their goodwill to guide you in your thinking.  If the company merely breaks even then they will in effect be adding a quarter of a billion dollars of tangible assets over the year.  Tangible assets are rewarded by the market at a higher value than intangible assets.  So as  those intangibles are converted to tangibles and the 30 dollar book value is represented by tangible assets, the price of the stock will move to the the 30.00 range (without being profitable!)In the mean time it will spike up like it did based on headlines. Then it will get shorted back down.  Of course it may not get shorted back down.  I think it will.  The best thing to do, is to buy more shares after it gets shorted.  If the satellites get launched in mid to late 2025 and they come on line in 2026, revenues will start to ramp up in 2027 and serious tangible equity will start to build and the price will triple what it is today or quadruple what it may be tomorrow. I happily provide this knowing you won&#39;t believe it."
