Reddit,2024-08-01,"Your table is missing a key piece of data, analysts usually give 12 month price targets, so how accurate did the analysts price turn out to be 12 months later? Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks.",Neutral,0,0.6505180597305298,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,Ill be honest its really not. I came to knowast year that NVDA was priced above 700 pre split but I was scared and only invested in QQQM. It then crossed 1000. I read about analyst ratings about ISRG. I invested a small amount after some research. It has gone 20 since then and has been solid despite tech sell off. I think analyst ratings is helpful to screen companies and not go tits up. I think what is usually lost is that they give a price range and typically most of us dont take risk into account and just invest blindly.,Positive,1,0.9921824336051941,Reply

I still invested because I follow the company and think there is a significant upside and current analyst opinions are recency bias. So I believe analyst opinions are a piece of information.

Reddit,2024-08-09,"While I am actually on your alls viewsidewhatdafukeva you cant deny the overwhelming opinion that this is a loss of opportunity while you wait. The biggest argument is a high yield savings account HYSA will out pace it in a year. I think thats a bit short sighted because their acting like interest rates will never move lower, but their point still stands, currently you would be better off letting it sit and accumulate interest than bag holding. We dont even have to guess at a timeframe or anything. Just take what you would put in intel and calculate your balance in a high yield savings account over the next 2 years by month. That is literally what you are aiming to beat minimum, otherwise its actually a loss for your risk and effort. If in the next 30 days you sell for a 10 pop, great, but the company literally told everyone expect nothing for a year, and even after that, who boy, just know we are working hard and will update then. The longer you hold, the higher that needs to be just to beat the HYSA. Back to the short sightedness of the HYSA . 1 they probably are not doing that, its just a floor they are using to compare what they are doing with their money ex not giving two craps about a 1 dividend and trying to beat it. Their being smart and not marrying the play, stock or HYSA, and we all should be doing that. If the HYSA is no good, dump it and move to the next channel thats best at that time. The difference between intel and HYSA is you can get out of the HYSA at anytime with 0 loss and invest elsewhere, while Intel may have lost value. They 100 dont make perfect plays, but its hard for them to watch others make dumb plays that cant even track interest rates without saying anything. Bottom line, if you plan to be 100 passive, your picks are probably not best, especially if you refuse to pivot when terrible news shows up at the front page of every search engine.

If you watch this sub a week or two youll see guys posting 50k, 100k, 500k losses. Options were originally intended as a way to hedge your positions, and most hedge funds and serious investors still use them for that purpose. It works something like this Say i bought 10000 shares of nvda a couple years ago. Its gone up huge, lets say i paid 10 a share and theyre worth 100 a share now. I could buy long dated like years puts betting on it going to 50 or less. The puts would be very cheap for me to buy because thats very unlikely to happen but now in case something terrible does happen and nvda does crash my puts will pay off and i wont lose everything.

I couldnt justify 300mo for the volume and percentage of commercials I was forced to watch on live TV. My first streaming device was my Wii console and ultimately moved to Roku. Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to.

Reddit,2024-08-03,"The Fed isnt wrong, the bond market is bullyIng the Fed into cutting. There are no liquidity issues that would necessitate cuts inline with bond market pricing. Traders want to take advantage of the latest job numbers to make profitable their bond trades, and they will quickly dump back into stocks once they get the excess liquidity they want. Asset prices are still elevated so introducing excess liquidity would be problematic for combating inflation. QE caused wild asset inflation and that changes the dynamic. The Fed needs to get to 2 inflation and holding before it can comfortably cut. We cannot afford loosening monetary policy too early. Fed holds too long and causes a recession, fine. It cuts too soon and allows inflation to gain steam, thats a big problem.",Negative,-1,0.9999946355819702,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-03,"There are around 38 million people in poverty in the US and around 23 million millionaires. However did you realize that the majority of millionaires in the US are over the age of 50. So the easiest way to pick out someone who isnt a millionaire is to find someone young and working a 95 job. It is surprisingly easy to sort Americans by income and picking a random one that fits either category is also relatively simple. And no, Im not talking about people who dress fashionably or drive a Cybertruck as their daily driver. I mean that old couple that bought their house in the 60s and 70s and have been retried since the 90s. That doesnt change the fact that bottom wages dont keep up with inflation. Middle and high wages do, but bottom wages only change when the minimum wage is adjusted. Of course there are some jobs that are exceptions. Costco workers get inflation based adjustments as do Starbucks employees, but your average Dollar General, Wendys or Walmart employee is not getting inflation adjusted increases.

I mentioned that minimum wage going up is the main way that people in the lowest tier get raises, but that doesnt keep up with inflation.

You then responded that America has a lot of millionaires to which I stated America has more people in poverty thank millionaires. You stated that 1.6 of people make minimum wage which is a completely inane and stupid metric to go by especially realizing that if you make 14.75 and minimum wage is 14 then you are making over minimum wages and said you gave references that you NEVER provided, so I instead gave a reference on American poverty directly from the American census which supports the statements I have made. So when did this swap from a conversation about the poorest in the US not getting wage increases that keep up with inflation to only people making minimum wage are poor?

Yeah, I know it and you know it, but as usual let&#39;s only talk about the other side and, for no surprise, the bad side.This being said, let&#39;s talk about the promotions news. The promotions news do not apply to all levels, so please do a better research on your own before posting, would you?True, other firms may offer you a higher salary, but how many of them offer you the compensations ACN does? Namely on equity side? Where you have the opportunity, in every 6 months, to buy their stock with 15% market discount? Yes, you heard me 15%.On top of that, add the shareholder value from every single quarter: buybacks and dividend hikes. BUT again... let&#39;s focus on the &#34;bad&#34; news, shall we?To conclude, this was just a reason WST found to send ACN stock down, period. That&#39;s how the game is played.
