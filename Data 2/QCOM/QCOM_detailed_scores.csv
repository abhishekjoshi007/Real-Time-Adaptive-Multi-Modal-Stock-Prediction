So far all leaks about the 8 Gen 4 look stellar. They look like theyd be stellar not in a phone but in a laptopminipc enclosure. Acquire Intel CPU design team to add additional parallel development teams that release in different years To me it already looks like Qualcomm is primed for the data center, laptop, and desktop. Dont think they should go for the x86 license. Stick with ARM and develop RISCV on the side. Buy out Intel ARC team and technology to speed up their GPU development for something suitable for workstation and data center. Intel GPUs arent great now but they do have workstation and datacentric designs already deployed with drivers that theyve been able to spend years working on.

I mean everybody talks about fabs as national interest, but financially speaking the design is the MOAT, is the High Added Value. Mass production was and is subcontracted for low value, will be lucrative for few years maybe thanks to subsidies but will immediately get back to low value as soon as subsidies stop. And by the way, this split must be done whether with takeover or without a takeover, this is dictated by their debt holders, because they want to precisely know what they can sell to be paid back.

Reddit,2024-09-20,"Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days Deal for Intel would be massive and come as chip maker is sputtering By Lauren Thomas and Laura Cooper Updated Sept. 20, 2024 345 pm ET Chip giant Qualcomm made a takeover approach to rival Intel in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter. A deal for Intel, which had a market value of roughly 87 billion early Friday, would be massive and come as the chip maker has been suffering through one of the most significant crises in its fivedecade history. A deal is far from certain, the people cautioned. Even if Intel is receptive, a deal of that size is all but certain to attract antitrust scrutiny, though it is also possible it could be seen as an opportunity to strengthen the countrys competitive edge in chips. To get the deal done, Qualcomm could intend to sell assets or parts of Intel to other buyers. Intelonce the worlds most valuable chip companyhas seen its shares drop roughly 60 so far this year. The company once had a market value of more than 290 billion at its peak. The stock rose 7 Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the approach. Shares in Qualcomm, which has a market value of around 185 billion, dropped around 4. Qualcomm is a leading supplier of chips for smartphones, including ones that manage communications between phones and cell towers. It is one of the most critical suppliers for Apples iPhones, among a range of other devices.",Neutral,0,0.7578034996986389,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-20,"Heres our take on the IntelQualcomm situation. We made the article free for anyone interested An excerpt from the article It isnt clear that a deal for Intel would strengthen Qualcomm. The vast majority of Qualcomms business comes from selling smartphone processors, 5G wireless chips, and licensing mobile technology. There isnt much synergy with Intels core x86 PC and server processor business, which has been losing significant market share to Advanced Micro Devices in recent years. Intels PC chips have already been eclipsed by inhouse offerings from Apple and others, which draw on designs from Arm Holdings. On the data center side, New Street Research estimates that AMDs x86 server processor business will reach 40 market share by yearend, up from less than 5 four years ago. Those gains have come at the expense of Intel, making it that much less attractive to Qualcomm, or any other suitor. A merger wont fix Intels biggest problem, its foundry, or chip manufacturing business. For Intel Foundry to succeed, the company needs a flagship U.S. customer like Apple, AMD, or Nvidia. While Intel has announced smaller deals, including one with Amazon Web Services last week, theyre not large enough to matter.

Reddit,2024-08-19,"Youre missing the big picture with AI. They cannot and will not slow down investment. This is why Nvidia is such a great play. Im not as familiar with AMDs products so I wouldnt personally touch that, but if it has skin in AI scaling, take it. The thing is, we are in a tech war with scaling gen AI systems with the biggest, most profitable and cash rich companies. They have not seen a slowing of results through scaling, and none of them can cut back on spending while the others are still spending. If they do, they will fall behind and may never catch up. In fact, even more players are continuing to enter the race. This will not end until some other resource depletes and gates scaling. Right now its silicon, next will likely be energy. Utilities, batteries, etc. Or, when scaling AI systems shows decreasing returns. But this is hard to define because a small increase in neural net size relatively, say 10x for say 100x the cost SEEMS on the surface to be a poor investment. You get 110 of the scale per unit of cost. However what matters is capability, and then application of that capability. This may go on for several years, or more.

Pair that to the market instability, capital drying up, massive backlogs of the chip fabs. This round is done in real terms. Well have to crash and youll have to either wait in safe investments to make or retain anything or sit in underperforming AI funds for 3 to 7 years before AI gets its wave 2. By then itll also have a lot more regulation around it and even a good chance for special taxes on AI replacement of jobs to fund UBI.

So AI imo has as much chance at deleveraging the entire tech sector of India as it does to grow GDP in India unless they make a deal thats massively advantageous for the US like leaving BRICS.

Reddit,2024-08-01,Ill be honest its really not. I came to knowast year that NVDA was priced above 700 pre split but I was scared and only invested in QQQM. It then crossed 1000. I read about analyst ratings about ISRG. I invested a small amount after some research. It has gone 20 since then and has been solid despite tech sell off. I think analyst ratings is helpful to screen companies and not go tits up.

That said, it wont be easy for locals to get a better paying job in the area, and a lot of people that live up there will swear up and down that they couldnt live anywhere else.

Reddit,2024-08-12,"What was your thought process behind blowing 25,000 on calls thatd expire worthless in 4 days if QCOM sat around its week low? You already had a 160,000 QCOM position that would have been either taking an outright loss or an economic loss due to opportunity cost, so the extra 25,000 was entirely a gamble that would have only added to your potential downside. You could received money to take on a position that hedged against your stock losing value, but instead you chose to pay money to make a larger bet. Thats not coherent risk management. And thats great, thats the whole point of this subredditbut dont turn around and then say shit like this Because for every possibility you already gave yourself the impossible. You give yourself reasons why its not possible so you dont have to bother learning on how to do it. You havent learned how to do anything beyond gamble your inheritance away, you absolute turbo degen. All you did was risk a bunch of money on bets. You dont have a strategy to prevent or minimize loss, or if you do you havent showed the positions, so as a result your gains are simply and entirely a byproduct of your own misattributed luck. Youre just a gambler, OP. Get the fuck off your high horse and stop acting like you know how to do anything beyond yoloing your money Congrats on the gains btw edit Good god I just saw your other comment, this actually isnt an inheritance.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"I cut the cable in 2008 when my cablesatellite bill was above 300month not to mention the cost of the receivers. I couldnt justify 300mo for the volume and percentage of commercials I was forced to watch on live TV. My first streaming device was my Wii console and ultimately moved to Roku. Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to. When you get used to watching what you want without constant commercial interruptions, it becomes very difficult and annoying to watch commercials every few minutes.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"youre referring to a correction. the point of the term of a dead cat bounce is theres a long downtrend for lets call it weeks, and a couple days of recovery which people get trapped in before the knife starts falling again. Also, with a dead cat bounce it would be more than a 0 2 recovery. The recovery is significant enough to believe that a bear trend is over. This is a correction, and Id expect itll be choppy for a bit, and who knows, maybe plenty more downside, but 2 days of red and a day of barely green doesnt fit the concept.",Negative,-1,0.9978591799736023,Reply

Arm claims that Qualcomm should have destroyed Nuvia&#39;s designs as part of the acquisition and asserts its rights under the original agreement with Nuvia.

Earlier this year, Apple extended its 5G modem supply agreement with Qualcomm for iPhone launches through 2026, so Apple&#39;s transition to its own in-house 5G chips will likely be gradual over multiple years.Apple acquired the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019, as part of its efforts to design its own 5G chip. It is unclear if Apple&#39;s chip would have any consumer benefits over Qualcomm&#39;s modems, but it would reduce Apple&#39;s reliance on Qualcomm.

Yahoo,2024-09-28,"I think it would be incredibly immature for you guys to buy intc.

You guys use arm and design chips, and mostly fail at it.  Several oems are making better arm chips designs than you are capable of.

The only worthwhile IP Qualcomm has is its modem business.

Your chip designs are incredibly simplistic compared to Intels, and you are one of a million chip designers.

And personally I find it pathetic you&#39;re letting oems have winning designs, that would be like Microsoft or Tesla developing a better GPU than Nvidia, or apple developing a better x86 chip than Intel.

The fact that Intel has managed to preserve significant market share while using old nodes is extremely impressive.

Seeing x elite get deetroyed by lunar lake should be all you need to know.

Qualcomm buying Intel would be an incredibly selfish move trying to buy yourselves time in the market, while massively diluting and muddying up Intel and the united states of America&#39;s future ambition.

Intel has fingerprints on literally everything in the tech world, even the majority of the standards we use.

Qualcomm is a dime a dozen chip designer with no software to make you stand out like Nvidias cuda, and no hardware either.

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only a matter of time before meta stops using Qualcomm as well in their products since they are investing more and more into chip design.

If Intel was short sighted, and wanted to compete in low margin arm chips, they would destroy Qualcomm at their own game.

And even speaking on financials, if intc was shortsighted and liquidated fabs and canceled fab projects, even their revenue and profit margins would destroy yours.

Please respectfully go away.

If you want to help the future of the world, sell your modem business, or focus purely on it, liquidate the rest of your company, and donate that cash to Intel so the west can stop getting destroyed in the new cold war.",Positive,1,0.9999872446060181,Main

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects QCOM) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of QCOM to make money for us.

So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on QCOM stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on QCOM stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.

Yahoo,2024-08-30,What will be decisive is whether AI services will run locally (on the &#34;edge&#34;) or in the cloud.Nvidia sells tensor cores for AI model training and AI cloud services. AI model training alone will not sustain Nvidia&#39;s growth. They need end-user AI cloud services for exponential growth to continue.End-user AI cloud services currently have the main advantage of being more powerful than local services. But some form of monetization is necessary to cover hardware and energy costs. This monetization still needs to materialize. Microsoft and Adobe are trying hard to set up subscription models for this purpose.Apple and Qualcomm both bet on local (&#34;edge&#34;) AI services (with limited cloud assistance where needed) and hope that their hardware sales will be enhanced by their AI offerings. Local processing has several advantages: privacy/confidentiality is ensured and energy costs are born by the end user.

Yahoo,2024-08-01,"The reason I rarely post on this board is because there isn&#39;t much information and or discussion to be had.  Example, yea Amon and company may have put the lid on short term price appreciation because of what they said about mobile phones.  So what?  They have historically been very conservative in their projections, and beating earnings estimates quarter after quarter proves this point. For a long term investor like myself this is great because I have high confidence they will outperform most if not all the time.  My all time favorite investor, Peter Lynch, said once.  The market is the only place I know that people get upset when things go on sale.",Positive,1,0.9999998807907104,Main

Don’t it remind you the time of 2021? When Pakash ran before everyone to speak about the market challenges and Qualcomm was suffered the most ? This guy should step down, what did he tell now to investors ? Don’t invest in company as we will be impacted 3 quarters in raw.
