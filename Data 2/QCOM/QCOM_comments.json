They have chip designers that have produced a competitive with Intel and AMD design. Their issue is software compatibility rather than a poor chip design. So far all leaks about the 8 Gen 4 look stellar. They look like theyd be stellar not in a phone but in a laptopminipc enclosure. Acquire Intel CPU design team to add additional parallel development teams that release in different years To me it already looks like Qualcomm is primed for the data center, laptop, and desktop. Dont think they should go for the x86 license. Stick with ARM and develop RISCV on the side. Buy out Intel ARC team and technology to speed up their GPU development for something suitable for workstation and data center. Intel GPUs arent great now but they do have workstation and datacentric designs already deployed with drivers that theyve been able to spend years working on. Qualcomm GPU drivers on Windows and Linux are far far behind Intel"

China is watching, even though it will of course be blocked, but this will be already humiliating This is very bad news for Intel shareholders because separating the activities into two will not only cost a lot money in restructuring the big mammouth, but also sacrifice the most lucrative part chip designs. I mean everybody talks about fabs as national interest, but financially speaking the design is the MOAT, is the High Added Value. Mass production was and is subcontracted for low value, will be lucrative for few years maybe thanks to subsidies but will immediately get back to low value as soon as subsidies stop. And by the way, this split must be done whether with takeover or without a takeover, this is dictated by their debt holders, because they want to precisely know what they can sell to be paid back. Personally, I think nothing will be done whatsoever and the big mammouth will slowly die in a debt whirlwind."

A deal for Intel, which had a market value of roughly 87 billion early Friday, would be massive and come as the chip maker has been suffering through one of the most significant crises in its fivedecade history. A deal is far from certain, the people cautioned. Even if Intel is receptive, a deal of that size is all but certain to attract antitrust scrutiny, though it is also possible it could be seen as an opportunity to strengthen the countrys competitive edge in chips. To get the deal done, Qualcomm could intend to sell assets or parts of Intel to other buyers. Intelonce the worlds most valuable chip companyhas seen its shares drop roughly 60 so far this year. The company once had a market value of more than 290 billion at its peak. The stock rose 7 Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the approach. Shares in Qualcomm, which has a market value of around 185 billion, dropped around 4. Qualcomm is a leading supplier of chips for smartphones, including ones that manage communications between phones and cell towers. It is one of the most critical suppliers for Apples iPhones, among a range of other devices."

We made the article free for anyone interested An excerpt from the article It isnt clear that a deal for Intel would strengthen Qualcomm. The vast majority of Qualcomms business comes from selling smartphone processors, 5G wireless chips, and licensing mobile technology. There isnt much synergy with Intels core x86 PC and server processor business, which has been losing significant market share to Advanced Micro Devices in recent years. Intels PC chips have already been eclipsed by inhouse offerings from Apple and others, which draw on designs from Arm Holdings. On the data center side, New Street Research estimates that AMDs x86 server processor business will reach 40 market share by yearend, up from less than 5 four years ago. Those gains have come at the expense of Intel, making it that much less attractive to Qualcomm, or any other suitor. A merger wont fix Intels biggest problem, its foundry, or chip manufacturing business. For Intel Foundry to succeed, the company needs a flagship U.S. customer like Apple, AMD, or Nvidia. While Intel has announced smaller deals, including one with Amazon Web Services last week, theyre not large enough to matter. Amazon is sticking with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to manufacture its more critical AI chips, including Trainium and Inferentia."

I was expecting it to come from Nvidia, but maybe they dont think they can win the antitrust fight. AMD doesnt really need them and in any case a merger of the only two real x86 CPU producers would never be allowed, at least not while ARM is still so niche and nobody else is even playing.

While they are first provider of ARM for Windows, they are in a crowded segment with AMD and Intel in their heels. Snapdragon X surely offers ARM as first for Windows, but we will need to see sales before concluding them the winner. Intels Lunar lake more closely copies the M chips from Apple. Meanwhile, sales have slumped for Apple on the M series as the upgrades becomes less and less, while there is a big chunk of upgrades for Windows, similar is expected but with more competition. QCOM is big in mobile, but again, many competitors with recent Huawei ban, Googles chips for Pixel etc. catching up to speed, QCOM is not market leader at the moment, etc. I think QCOM was a great buy before people started to discover it when NVDA went amok, I think they are decently priced now with potential upside, just not sure how high an upside and whether we will see the chip market slump a bit before taking off again. Curious to hear others opinion and analysis. EDIT Brooos and the event I had not expected, a lot of talk about it, but still sounded a bit unlikely Apple has dropped QCOM for cellular chips due to inhouse efforts.

They have not seen a slowing of results through scaling, and none of them can cut back on spending while the others are still spending. If they do, they will fall behind and may never catch up. In fact, even more players are continuing to enter the race. This will not end until some other resource depletes and gates scaling. Right now its silicon, next will likely be energy. Utilities, batteries, etc. Or, when scaling AI systems shows decreasing returns. But this is hard to define because a small increase in neural net size relatively, say 10x for say 100x the cost SEEMS on the surface to be a poor investment. You get 110 of the scale per unit of cost. However what matters is capability, and then application of that capability. This may go on for several years, or more. This silicon cycle is not one that Id say for sure will follow the typical semi cycles. Eventually of course it will, I just dont think the timelines are remotely the same"

Also, already saw a ton of discounts of high end brands with the Snapdragon X, not sure what to make of it. Overall, I think the benefits of ARM is quite clearly demonstrated by Apple, most of the world today is mobile with laptops being the primary work station. Battery life is great and the high performance for office related apps are the most important. I see your point in many Windows user also using prof software that is currently not running on ARM. But with the performance of various video editing software etc. on M chips, I would hope prof software moves to ARM soon enough. But the vast variety offered for Windows with AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, etc. chips, it makes the transition hard or even impossible. Apple did a top down, now everyone is on ARM, Microsoft will never do that."

Only recently did Intel removed that constrain from their product team they are now allowed to manufacture their designs externally. Which leads us to what youve mentioned in your first post. Intel is going to introduce Lunar Lake soon, which is an x86 design specifically built for battery life and efficiency in mind. Whats important is that they will use leadingedge TSCM nodes for production, as well as simplifying the power delivery design to make them easier to deploy in a predictable manner by their partners. Most probably this will make Snapdragon X Elite completely redundant three months after release."

Pair that to the market instability, capital drying up, massive backlogs of the chip fabs. This round is done in real terms. Well have to crash and youll have to either wait in safe investments to make or retain anything or sit in underperforming AI funds for 3 to 7 years before AI gets its wave 2. By then itll also have a lot more regulation around it and even a good chance for special taxes on AI replacement of jobs to fund UBI. Not to mention the US is going to be increasingly protective of AI tech towards other countries including India. So AI imo has as much chance at deleveraging the entire tech sector of India as it does to grow GDP in India unless they make a deal thats massively advantageous for the US like leaving BRICS. Thats why AI will bust just like crypto did, and grew, and busted again, and grew. This is wave 1, save your money and energy for wave 2 and 3.

Buyers probably have enough supply on site to weather the storm. This shouldnt be anything like when there was a fire in the 2000s that crippled production for months.

What tourism spruce pine had is gonna be gone for a while. On the HPQ side, the mines are fine, the production is fine, but transportation is still iffy and you might see some job openings as people had some major damage done to their homes and downtown. That said, it wont be easy for locals to get a better paying job in the area, and a lot of people that live up there will swear up and down that they couldnt live anywhere else. This isnt financial advice, but as I see it this is a couple weeks of disruption to production, followed by a period of time that has more challenging and expensive shipping small truck over rail.

You already had a 160,000 QCOM position that would have been either taking an outright loss or an economic loss due to opportunity cost, so the extra 25,000 was entirely a gamble that would have only added to your potential downside. You could received money to take on a position that hedged against your stock losing value, but instead you chose to pay money to make a larger bet. Thats not coherent risk management. And thats great, thats the whole point of this subredditbut dont turn around and then say shit like this Because for every possibility you already gave yourself the impossible. You give yourself reasons why its not possible so you dont have to bother learning on how to do it. You havent learned how to do anything beyond gamble your inheritance away, you absolute turbo degen. All you did was risk a bunch of money on bets. You dont have a strategy to prevent or minimize loss, or if you do you havent showed the positions, so as a result your gains are simply and entirely a byproduct of your own misattributed luck. Youre just a gambler, OP. Get the fuck off your high horse and stop acting like you know how to do anything beyond yoloing your money Congrats on the gains btw edit Good god I just saw your other comment, this actually isnt an inheritance.

Have your real account invested in low risk and use do all your high risk trading on a paper trading account.

I couldnt justify 300mo for the volume and percentage of commercials I was forced to watch on live TV. My first streaming device was my Wii console and ultimately moved to Roku. Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to. When you get used to watching what you want without constant commercial interruptions, it becomes very difficult and annoying to watch commercials every few minutes. At least for me."

Also, with a dead cat bounce it would be more than a 0 2 recovery. The recovery is significant enough to believe that a bear trend is over. This is a correction, and Id expect itll be choppy for a bit, and who knows, maybe plenty more downside, but 2 days of red and a day of barely green doesnt fit the concept."

Lets be realistic even with old architecture glued with new one they still managed to compete with Ryzen lineup far better than AMD competed with Intel when they came out with Bulldozer architecture.

If sales of the Snapdragon X Elite processor are stopped, some top flagship smartphones won&#39;t get shipped.  It&#39;s Qualcomm&#39;s move.  Pay up."

And it foresees capital expenditure rising in 2025 from roughly $30 billion this year.TSMC’s outlook should help tamp down concerns that investors mis-judged the AI and semiconductor demand. Those fears crystallized after chip industry linchpin ASML Holding NV stunned markets by reporting about half the orders investors had expected. On Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei sought to dispel those doubts.“The demand is real and I believe it’s just the beginning,” Wei said, echoing a number of executives including Nvidia’s CEO.

Earlier this year, Apple extended its 5G modem supply agreement with Qualcomm for iPhone launches through 2026, so Apple&#39;s transition to its own in-house 5G chips will likely be gradual over multiple years.Apple acquired the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019, as part of its efforts to design its own 5G chip. It is unclear if Apple&#39;s chip would have any consumer benefits over Qualcomm&#39;s modems, but it would reduce Apple&#39;s reliance on Qualcomm. In 2017, Apple sued Qualcomm over alleged anticompetitive practices and $1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies settled the lawsuit in 2019.”"

It appears on the surface that Don may be attempting to somehow manipulate the stock price ? Perhaps Don is a day trader trying to short QCOM stock and/or playing the put-call game or the volatile options market??  Personally I feel Don can do whatever he wants but I think be needs to provide some actual references like balance sheets, P &amp; L, cash flow, profits, etc.  Common sense basic fundamental analysis would be appreciated.  In the long run it is virtually impossible to short any company that is profitable, growing , paying a proven growing  dividend program, solid balance sheet.  I could go on but you get my basic position."

In 2017 to 2021 she served in the California Senate, during those four years she worked on 164 pieces of legislation. Not one of them ever were signed into law. Her job approval was 8%. What makes it worse is that she is a liberal governing in a liberal State and she was still zero for 164. So, during four years she accomplished.........nothing. As Vice President she has a record of the lowest approval rating ever in the history of this country at 28%.  This person is trying to get your vote to run the most powerful nation on earth."

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects QCOM) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of QCOM to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and groMost of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;.

In 2020, immediately after Biden and Harris won the presidency, the Russian military started building up forces along the Ukraine-Russia border. The same will begin to happen in China after a Harris and Walz win. An attack on Taiwan will send the California economy into a tailspin. Majority of the world&#39;s chips are designed in California and then manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC. The US and world economy will follow. This is a real possibility and preparations have been made. The recent China-Russia partnership is stategic. The Chinese will sell their manufacted products into Russia and Russia will sell China energy (oil and gas) to compensate for the heavy sanctions that are very likely to occur after an attack on Taiwan. How does one trade this possibility?"

U.S. government was also relying on INTC to build foundries in the U.S. and allied countries and outside of Taiwan.INTC&#39;s impending failure raised concerns in DC, which will be resolved if QCOM takes over INTC. FTC will make some pro forma demands but will otherwise approve the acquisition.I am not sure if it is good news for QCOM though. Integrating INTC and increasing its profitability will be a massive headache and will take away attention from innovation."

So, a QCOM investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects QCOM the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for QCOM. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

Of course, Apple should have had this done years ago. The Apple contract expired in 2023 but was temporarily renewed. Therefore, we know they are extremely close. We also know that Samsung&#39;s program  &#34;SYSTEM LSI&#34; is their strategy to bring their chip business in-house as well. Samsung&#39;s in-house modem initiative is called &#34;EXYNOS.&#34; Samsung already sells their own in-house chips overseas. Just the apple news would cut up to 10B off Qualcomm revenue. All of this is concerning and there is more trouble on the horizon -- it&#39;s how MEDIATEK is eating Qualcomm&#39;s lunch. Mediatek IS the real deal.Essentially after Apple and Samsung are free to move off, QCOM will essentially be flying blind in the market. QCOM is attempting to bring clarity with an Intel purchase but it signals desperation."

So, a QCOM investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects QCOM the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for QCOM. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like QCOM to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax QCOM would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of QCOM stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on QCOM stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on QCOM stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."

Unless MSFT comes out with Copilot + Phone spurring new demand for x86-based Windows phones, relying just on Samsungs and LGs is not going to give you the desired growth trajectory.ARM-based AI PC chips will be under pressure once Intel and AMD up the game -- x86 based Intel and AMD will try to market their chips as AI + no software compatibility issues. Most users don&#39;t care about 15 hr vs. 22 hr battery life if they know for sure all their software is going to &#34;just work&#34; on x86 based PC. As much as I want ARM-based PCs to succeed, it would be a hard sell unless everyone in the supply chain - QCOM, MSFT, OEMs - show their utmost commitment to bring the software compatibility (read a huge pool of developers developing native ARM-based software) and gaming performance at par with x86 based PCs.Auto revenue is increasing YoY, but it is the lone successful adjacent business and by itself insufficient to rebrand QCOM as &#34;not-only-mobile&#34; company.Other adjacent businesses revenues are negligible and at least a couple of years away until they get noticed.Their licensing business is just a cash cow with no significant growth.I wonder why BlackRock and Vanguards are still holding on to it. Perhaps, they know more than I do."

AI model training alone will not sustain Nvidia&#39;s growth. They need end-user AI cloud services for exponential growth to continue.End-user AI cloud services currently have the main advantage of being more powerful than local services. But some form of monetization is necessary to cover hardware and energy costs. This monetization still needs to materialize. Microsoft and Adobe are trying hard to set up subscription models for this purpose.Apple and Qualcomm both bet on local (&#34;edge&#34;) AI services (with limited cloud assistance where needed) and hope that their hardware sales will be enhanced by their AI offerings. Local processing has several advantages: privacy/confidentiality is ensured and energy costs are born by the end user. Apple and Qualcomm would win and Nvidia would lose if this scenario materializes."

I don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t give a estimate because fab time is 8-12 weeks and nobody starts wafers until they is a firm PO.  Q knows what the firm orders are for 12 weeks into the future.  they could at least state X Elite will contribute &#34;insert estimate range here&#34; to earnings.

Qcom also has thousands of lawyers to enforce the patents. 3) Even if Apple does get something in the distant future - it will be obsoleted by Qcom 6G. 4) Why the story?  Apple makes modem noise from time to time - how many time have we heard it before - in &#39;21, &#39;22, 23, now in 24.? It may be coming from the modem team to justify the billions in spending and to the analysts asking where is the beef. And to maintain pressure on Qcom and get leverage on pricing.

Example, yea Amon and company may have put the lid on short term price appreciation because of what they said about mobile phones.  So what?  They have historically been very conservative in their projections, and beating earnings estimates quarter after quarter proves this point. For a long term investor like myself this is great because I have high confidence they will outperform most if not all the time.  My all time favorite investor, Peter Lynch, said once.  The market is the only place I know that people get upset when things go on sale."

Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said the company expects units to be either “flattish” or up by a single-digit percentage this year.Qualcomm’s earnings forecast initially sent its shares up more than 6% in extended trading, but the stock retreated following the remarks from Amon and other executives on a conference call with analysts. By 6 p.m. in New York, Qualcomm shares were down more than 1%.Comments by executives also undermined confidence that the recovery will pick up pace. Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said he expects growth in the December quarter to be little changed from a year earlier, when sales increased 5%. Analysts had been predicting a rise of 9%.&#34;"
