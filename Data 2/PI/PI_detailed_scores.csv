Yahoo,2024-10-28,"PI management on their Q2 call let everyone know that Q4 would be soft because they ship ahead of the holdiay season in Q3.  Still Q3 beat and even Q4 guidance is higher.PI had a large increase in Q3 with no real news, on mostly low volume.  It was going to correct.  These corrections drive out the weak investors and speculators.  Most private investors lose in the market because they buy in when everything looks great and dump when the stock retreats for fear of going lower.  Buffet says 10 years and expect a 50% price reduction along the way.  Hope that doesnt happen but PI has hundreds of patents built on top of other patents going back 20 years.  That can&#39;t be easily duplicated, NXP tried and lost, a 61 billion marketcap company.  That tells everyone not to try it.  So it is the only company producing RAIN RFID ICs.PI is growing year over year with growth in all their sectors and they are the technology.  DPP coming. Qualcomm coming, Walmart adopting, and many others will follow.  m800 coming on line, and food starting to adopt.The CEO and founder is telling us this will take years, but steady growth for years is exactly why I have a position in PI.PI tanked in 2003.
