If youre not beating the SP then youre losing. Bear in mind that while youre sitting on cash waiting for the next piece of bad news, that money isnt appreciating like it would with a set it and forget it approach. Also every time one of your picks starts to plateau and you decide to sell you have to give the tax man his cut which means you have less to reinvest. If you have to sell before youve owned the stock for a year then youll have to pay capital gains which will cut into your profit even more. All these things plus the fact that there isnt a guarantee that a stock will bounce back from bad news means that this is probably not the slam dunk you think it is. You may get lucky a few times but its probably not a sustainable investing strategy."
