Reddit,2024-09-10,"How to cheat the market of 20 trillion? Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base. This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that dont exist. Is it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, its true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports Trading 10.7 yy and 43.5 for 2Q24, and for 1H24 11.6 yy and 44.2 for two years further in the sequence shown. Medical 38.9 and 22.2 19.5 and 44.9 ! Consumer Discretionary 23.6 and 2.1 due to Warner Bros. 10 bln loss 8.7 and 0.7. Industrials 4.4 and 4.7 9.3 and 10.3. Commodities and utilities 13 and 52.1 21.1 and 33.9 ! Transportation and communications 37.5 and 0.1 10 and 5.8. Technology 22.8 and 38.9 30.7 and 24. These data, please note, are at par! If we compare 1H24 to 1H22, three sectors are in the negative medical, raw materials and transportation, communications, two are in the zero consumer discretionary and industrials and only two sectors are in the plus technology and trade due to Amazon. There are literally 10 tech companies in good profit, everyone else is very bad. But everyone else is on the hai look it up.",Neutral,-1,0.7578226029872894,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-07,"Bro. I just want to mention that the part of your mind that is connecting the dots is the same part of the brain a pigeon uses to think flapping its wings a certain way will produce more food, as observed by a scientific study. Superstition comes from the lymbic system. There is no real correlation outside the fabric of your mind. This is why gambling addicts have such a hard time getting free, because they think their thoughts are indistinguishable from reality and what is actually true and real. You are noticing the Pepsi truck because you were already thinking about it. Its like noticing all the for sale signs on homes the moment you begin to think about becoming a home buyer. They arent popping into existence because you all of a sudden want to buy a home.

Reddit,2024-08-14,"Former Cisco employee here. You have no idea how dysfunctional engineering product development is. Managers only care about padding their resumes, know nothing technical, do nothing for their teams. It is ALL about self promotion. Look into Software Defined Networking SDN which is absolutely eating Ciscos lunch. Years ago Cisco made big money with proprietary software running on expensive hardware. The new normal is free software running on commodity hardware. The only revenue source is support, which is now being outsourced to India. Good luck! They have no AI, no security track record, best engineers have been LRed to cut costs, UCS servers are just bloated appliances, Webex is one player in a crowded field.",Neutral,0,0.8468834757804871,Reply

Yahoo,2024-10-29,"There are many issues in this election, but one central issue hasalways been what most significantly divides the Republicans fromthe Democrats. Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies that growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear.",Neutral,0,0.9394843578338623,Main

So, an HPE investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects HPE the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors. All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for HPE.

Yahoo,2024-09-26,"There are 4 ways that Kamala Harris wants to raise your taxes on your investments:She wants to tax long term capital gains and qualified dividends as &#34;ordinary income&#34;.So, if you sell your HPE stock for a $10,000 LT capital gain and you&#39;re in the 24% marginaltax bracket for your regular income, you would pay $2,400 for the gain instead of $1,500 (15%).She wants the tax reductions from 2017 to expire. That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects HPE) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of HPE to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;.
