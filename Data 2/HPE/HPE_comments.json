Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base. This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that dont exist. Is it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, its true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports Trading 10.7 yy and 43.5 for 2Q24, and for 1H24 11.6 yy and 44.2 for two years further in the sequence shown. Medical 38.9 and 22.2 19.5 and 44.9 ! Consumer Discretionary 23.6 and 2.1 due to Warner Bros. 10 bln loss 8.7 and 0.7. Industrials 4.4 and 4.7 9.3 and 10.3. Commodities and utilities 13 and 52.1 21.1 and 33.9 ! Transportation and communications 37.5 and 0.1 10 and 5.8. Technology 22.8 and 38.9 30.7 and 24. These data, please note, are at par! If we compare 1H24 to 1H22, three sectors are in the negative medical, raw materials and transportation, communications, two are in the zero consumer discretionary and industrials and only two sectors are in the plus technology and trade due to Amazon. There are literally 10 tech companies in good profit, everyone else is very bad. But everyone else is on the hai look it up."

I just want to mention that the part of your mind that is connecting the dots is the same part of the brain a pigeon uses to think flapping its wings a certain way will produce more food, as observed by a scientific study. Superstition comes from the lymbic system. There is no real correlation outside the fabric of your mind. This is why gambling addicts have such a hard time getting free, because they think their thoughts are indistinguishable from reality and what is actually true and real. You are noticing the Pepsi truck because you were already thinking about it. Its like noticing all the for sale signs on homes the moment you begin to think about becoming a home buyer. They arent popping into existence because you all of a sudden want to buy a home. Good luck, I hope that for your sake, Pepsi burns to the ground tomorrow so you can return to reality."

Maybe spend like 10 a month on it, and try to aim for bets that have the lowest odds possible of succeeding 1 to 1,000,000 odds, where 99.9999 of the time I just lose my bet completely."

If they faked 50 of their numbers that means demand is down 5 for Nvidia in that specific sector when SMCI stops buying... doesnt sound like ,,a lot to me. Also the companies who dont use SMCI tech are completely untouched by this as their demand was never based on SMCI numbers. Its 100 not good news but its not apocalypse."

When you look at this at a rack level, the problems just compound. Both heat dissipation and power delivery are very challenging. I work on solutions like this in my day job, and Supermicro is one of our vendors. Supermicro as a company has serious issues, but liquid cooling at rack and data center level is a legitimate solution for a relatively recent problem.

Managers only care about padding their resumes, know nothing technical, do nothing for their teams. It is ALL about self promotion. Look into Software Defined Networking SDN which is absolutely eating Ciscos lunch. Years ago Cisco made big money with proprietary software running on expensive hardware. The new normal is free software running on commodity hardware. The only revenue source is support, which is now being outsourced to India. Good luck! They have no AI, no security track record, best engineers have been LRed to cut costs, UCS servers are just bloated appliances, Webex is one player in a crowded field."

Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies that growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear."

So, an HPE investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects HPE the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors. All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for HPE. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects HPE) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of HPE to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

So, an HPE investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects HPE the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for HPE. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

Anything in between and you get 50 dollars of HPE stock on the mandatory conversion.  Are you sure that they will need to borrow that much?  I read that they recently sold 30% of one of one of their subsidiaries for 2.8 billion in cash?  And if HPE continues to raise their dividend it could support a higher stock price in three years  with interest rates dropping.  My only question is will it trade below par once it gets listed.  Good luck."

With the current share count of 1.3 billion that is at most about a 6% dilution.  You get paid an interest rate of 7.625% a year on your investment for the 3 years prior to mandatory conversion and then you get between 2.5 and 3.1 common shares for each preferred share you own.  That comes out to between 16 and 20 dollars a common share for each 50 dollar preferred share.  That&#39;s about what the current share price has been in the past 6 mo.   However HPE is going to have to borrow about 10 billion dollars to fund the total purchase price of 14 billion dollars in cash for Juniper Networks.  That&#39;s going to be a hefty price in interest on that loan.  What do others on this forum think?"

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like HP to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax HP would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of HP stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on HP stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on HP stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."
