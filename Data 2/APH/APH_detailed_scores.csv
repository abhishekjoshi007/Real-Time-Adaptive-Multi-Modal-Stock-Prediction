Yahoo,2024-09-25,Been a holder of this stock for years and two splits. All the electricity needs sensors and connectors. Who would of thought when I used amphenol connectors for phone work many years ago they would have grown to this size. Definitely a long play stock. Maybe not as volatile as others but steady growth and allows you to sleep at night. Will keep going to 100+ and who knows another split,Positive,1,0.9993835687637329,Main
