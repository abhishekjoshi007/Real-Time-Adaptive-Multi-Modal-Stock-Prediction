Their tools are highly opinionated, as in they force you to setup your data in a way that is amenable to the way their software analyzes data. Highly opinionated means less flexibility, and this is the complete opposite of what the industry is doing, which is to maximize flexibility by offering every niche solution as a SaaS product and hiring a bunch of data engineers to do the custom integration. Bull case is that their productivity tools are not only top tier but also scalable, as in they can become more of a monolithic SaaS company and less of a consulting company over the next few years. Also, if anyone figures out how to manage autonomous agents that can execute business logic within organizations, its going to be MSFT or PLTR. Sorry AMZN, GOOG, and CRM. Bear case is that their productivity tools are just mid and the secret sauce is their forward deployed engineers that get paid enormous salaries at the expense of stock holders, which would make them an overpriced consulting company."

The company reported an impressive 80 increase in server revenue, reaching 7.76 billion, which outperformed expectations. This growth is indicative of Dells strategic positioning as a key player in the AI market, particularly with its partnerships involving Nvidias technology. Interestingly, while Dells overall revenue reached 25.06 billion, reflecting a 9 yearoveryear increase, the margins have raised concerns among analysts. The net income increased substantially, yet the overall profitability seems constrained, leading to discussions about competitive pressures in the server market. For those interested in the broader context of public SaaS companies and their performance metrics, you can find more detailed Public SaaS Companies Insights on this topic. The interplay between hardware sales and software solutions continues to shape the competitive landscape, especially as companies like Dell navigate the evolving demands of AI and cloud computing."

They have practically no top line growth since 2018 and bottom line just became positive in 2020 after 5 years of losses and has actually shrunk since then... Margins are razor thin. Are you expecting some decent growth the next few years? Cuts dont fill me with confidence. Are they out of ideas? Are they expecting demand to fall? It might improve bottom line but it certainly wont help the top. Also cuts usually results in worse service. Dell lives and dies with service contracts. No one actually cares about their brand of products. They are actually annoying due to adding propietary crap. Companies use Dell because they are approved by government and offer long term service contracts while being unlikely to go out of business within contract terms. Are cuts going to make their service worse? On top of all that, the markets are bloated right now so not exactly the best time to start positions. Are they doing anything else worth note aside from cuts? Takeover is not likely at this valuation. Who has 80b laying around for a low margin business that is historically inconsistent. Is there even a company out there that has synergy with them to integrate them? Only thing I can think of is GPU and CPU makers? But they dont have that kind of cash laying around. A merger maybe? But I think Dell is the one who will have to make concessions, not the other way... unless its Intel lol."

I propose Dell whenever I can by default. But truth is, their MSRP vs reseller price margin is relatively low compared to other manufacturers which means less incentives to promote and sell their products. Dell also recently revised their pricing up early aug which made them even worst off and less competitive now. One thing that I hate is they sold off VMware to Broadcom late last year, for those who dont know, in the tech world Broadcom is known to take over companies or good products and drives the prices up so much and fire off good support and developersread senior and expensive and make everything about , eventually driving the product to the drain. VMware has such good potential and is so widely adopted that if Dell just held and invest in it, it can be one of their core products. But no they just sold if off and earning vendettas from the tech world. Hardware demand is slowing in the consumer end, honestly the software developments over the years doesnt make replacing your laptop that urgent anymore. For normal office work, you can work as well on a 5 year old laptop compared to a new one now where as it use to be have an excel file running for 5min vs 1min for a 2005 laptop vs a 2010 laptop, now its both 30s for a 2019 laptop and 2024 laptop. For the AI hype, well, there maybe a chance for ppl to want to replace their laptops if microsoft or some third party software company coming up with some good implementation of locally processed AI workload but even then Dell is still just one of the options. I just dont see great potential in Dells future at the moment."

Nor do I see a opening for them to grow. Nor are they particularly great at anything. I mean hell... you would think that they can at least make a decent retail site but they cant even do that. Too many product lines and not much difference between them. Too much dependence on windows. They actually had a Linux line once but gave up on it far too soon. So now they have absolutely nothing to differentiate themselves. This, btw, is how Apple came back. They provided an alternative when there was weakness in the market. Dell barely gave it like 2 years before folding. Dumb. Also STOP with the flucking discount codes and just put low prices up front. How hard is that? These stupid flips... go on their site and look up hard drives. 1st thing that comes up is a 8gb external seagate for 199. Oh yay I get Dell Points for buying it yippeee...

Long term, I think DELL will be alright for a while, they will definitely grow but not like Google, Amazon type."

If they faked 50 of their numbers that means demand is down 5 for Nvidia in that specific sector when SMCI stops buying... doesnt sound like ,,a lot to me. Also the companies who dont use SMCI tech are completely untouched by this as their demand was never based on SMCI numbers. Its 100 not good news but its not apocalypse."

How much is unknown. counting revenue for items not yet shipped or items that are defective Amazon isnt a buyer Tesla has started buying elsewhere Nvda had stated that Dell was the way to go coreweave has started buying elsewhere So if this is what Hindenberg knows what else is out there? There are like 57 major buyers out there. So what do the other major buyers think? I guess I could be wrong and everything will be fine and Hindenberg will go down in flames.

Im not knowledgeable enough to understand some of what you have explained so my questions may be rather basic. It sounds like you were trading options, which I understand on a basic level, but do not yet have the confidence to trade them, and unless I got in on a penny stock before it ballooned, the methods of trading I use buy and hold, no options, I dont think it is even possible to achieve the returns people like you post as I believe you are risking more loss potential for greater gains with calls. Now if I am correct so far, what is the ELI5 ROI difference between the trades youre placing and the ones I am placing? For instance, if you just bought and sold basic shares instead of buying options, I suspect you would have 110th or less of the return you have. Is my understanding of this correct?"

Thats how the market is. But once you feel what its like to have that 1M and maybe lose it, you will beg and plead with the universe to have that 1M again, just so you can not repeat your mistake and keep what you had. Believe me brother. Let the reality of your success sit in before you do anything that could possibly compromise this. You won the game. Dont play again. Its not worth it. You could win more, sure, but you are now in the position where you can do that SAFELY because youre now a millionaire and get to invest like one. Key word. Invest. Not gamble. Now that you have 1M, you can get to 2, 5, 10. Without gambling. I wish you luck."

I remember you had talked about potentially selling covered calls on LUNR coming up and this was something I was also considering I have 500 shares. However, Ive recently learned that covered calls are best sold if you think the stock is going to remain flat andor decline some. So covered calls are actually a bearish trading strategy? So lets say I expect LUNR to go to 10 over the next 45 months, through the next launch which I basically do, and would be curious your thoughts on this point. Would selling covered calls actually not be the thing to do in this scenario then? Because we are bullish on it for next few months? Or do we sell covered calls for like a year or two out maybe? Because we know it will drop back down at some point after next launch and probably continue up and down some for next year before it starts really taking off? Sorry to bother you, I am still learning and had remembered your post so thought I would try and see your thoughts! Hope all is well!"

If you go unemployed you keep receiving 70 of your income for like half a year before they start to decrease the payments. Also roughly 35 PTO days, near unlimited sick leave. Oh my contract automatically tracks inflation. Some funsies Income tax does go up to 52 here though, so my employer pays out part of my salary in mealcheques which is subtracted from your gross before the taxman comes. So my groceries are untaxed except for VAT. Same with ecocheques which you can spend on green things, and Consumption cheques which you can spend on just about anything. Its some weird government facilitated tax evasion scheme. More funnies No capital gains tax in Belgium as long as you dont do daytrading or speculativehigh risk trading. If you LARP as a boomer trader the taxman doesnt care. Also if you buy Belgium or Ireland domiciled stonks you also dont pay the 1,32 tax for purchase of stonks. Dividends are taxed at 30 if you go above 800 a year. So the free money glitch here is to just put any money you dont need as a buffer into IWDA which is Ireland domiciled, reinvests the dividends into the fund, and it is roughly 60 SP500.

In a strong growth environment, rate cuts might typically give a stock market boost, but in a weakening soft landing economy, they can do the opposite, a brief spike up and reversal notwithstanding. Additional rate cuts can precede even more market drop, but there truly isnt a direct universal correlation, because its about larger context. Look at 2007, which is a similar analog to today in some ways prior to rate cuts in Sept, the market dropped 23 weeks and we may see that again here, then markets surged on the cut announcement, went up to new all time highs which we may also see again here as of SeptOct, like SP to 5800? 5900?. After the all time high peak, stocks then started their 18 month drop, even as rates kept dropping in salvage mode. Here now, the SP could easily touch 3900 into next year before a strong rebound, based on chart setups. No guarantees of course, but hence why I think its best to wait and watch a bit, risk is legitimately high going forward here. Watch the bond rates too, which are a leading indicator to the Fed funds rate or watch TLT going upward ahead as an inverse, it is set up to continue a new up trend. Fed rate changes always lag, but the bond rates dropping are also cluing in a weak economy ahead, not strong. Rate cuts in this environment actually reduce govt interest expenditure which is a massive source of liquidity that gets funneled into markets, essentially draining liquidity that the markets need to keep going up, and spurredon private borrowing on lower rates if it even happens isnt going to overpower that in a weakening environment. Similar to 2007 as well, and 2000, the technical chart pattern itself in each major index, SPX, NQ, RTY is now one of completing a multiyear run pattern, and at a large degree scale, not midrun or starting a new run. I think a lot of people feel like its 201617 about to repeat, rather than 2000 or 200708. But this is a different market context now than the last 1012 years, much more akin to 2007 in pattern, or more so 2000 in context and aftermath or even 1929, but I doubt we see any straight plunge like 29, more like a grind down and up with multiple plunges. There are no crystal balls obviously, just correlated clues and patterns, but together it hints at a rough riskreward skew going forward, and a rough frustrating and quite volatile buyandhold environment for the next decade, like holding through the 1970s or 2000s, maybe worse, though there would surely be some very strong swings upward."

Probably a bit flat for a while maybe a small loss and then onward with regular expected growth. The answer on this earnings most option buyers will get pounded, share buyers arent sweating much."

I could be wrong about how well they are doing, but puts are my gut reaction. edit also their security or store procedures suck dick. some old lady was able to buy a pair of shoes using my card. and I had to track her down and have kohls investigate etc. and It was probably just some dumb employee that looked up the wrong name in store and charged it to my card because Sears used to have that issue also."

There is a metric to options, several actually, but one in particular called implied volatility IV for short. Iv plays a factor into options price, and iv is driven by expected events that would drive market price. Earnings is a big one, dates of known contract announcements or company announcements. The market knows all of this and tracks it through IV. The closer you get to these events, the IV will rise, causing the price of an option to rise with it. So by buying options for known events as far away from them as you can stomach, the cheaper you can get that same option for. You have to balance that with how much you think the price will change before that event though. Options are simple yet complicated. So if you buy an option today for earnings tomorrow, it will likely be as expensive as that option gets. Starting the moment the event happens, the iv begins to drop dramatically, lowering the price of the option. This is known as iv crush if you have heard that term used."

But if you look at QoQ, QoQ revenue growth rate has been slowing QoQ revenue growth was 15, which is a lowering percentage that previous QoQ growths not Nvidias fault... its just that the law of large numbers is a bitch. Now that we got that out of the way. Heres some issues Their current margins are about as good as they can get... they can likely only get slightly better by a hair going forward, but there is more room for the downside to get substantially worse. Cyclicality. Any company that sells hardware, where a small concentrated customer base accounts for a large portion of their earnings, is prone to cyclical boom and busts. If Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla decide to not increase their spending on AI GPUs that much more from here or cut back on it, then RIP Nvidia. Following the previous point, why would they possibly not increase their spending that much more or even cut it? Because for the 100200 billion or so being spent on this crap, very little money is being made. OpenAI only made like 3 Billion in annual revenue.

And there will come a point later in the future where the cost of compute power comes down enough and the money made from AI goes up enough to make it worthwhile and profitable. But when that point comes, Nvidia may have competition, and they may no longer be making the insane margins theyre currently making from fleecing their customers, and Nvidias customers may not be spending that much more money than they do now because the costcompute is more favorable and they dont need to spend as insane amounts to meet their needs."

The fundamental problem with your thesis here is your making a macro call and then trying to apply it to a discrete event occurring very shortly. Even if we agreed that theres power concerns, fiscal concerns, concerns with the overall model of AI, concerns about chip manufacturing and ability Its unlikely any of that is on the ballot on the 28th. Whats going to be the concern is revenues for this quarter hitting towards the top end of expectations or exceeding it and then projections for the upcoming quarters Now maybe some of those issues feed into projections but I sort of doubt it. These are longer term problems, so Id be more willing to bet they become an issue over the next 6 to 18 months rather than in 3 days. So its a pretty regarded take to make based on the thesis. TLDR If you want to make a macro AI thesis you should put the time frame for it to play out at longer than 3 days. More like 618 months."

They perform far worst and there are not many libraries available so now you create two problems . The lack of support from libraries creates a difficult where you gonna have to either write your own library which requires time and resources from engineers or use the libraries that are already available but you have to jump through so many hoops to make it work and guess less performance that now you wasted time and money . Lets say you try to hire the top of line engineer most of them already have experience with CUDA , if not its easy enough to learn but if you go anywhere else and try to build in house now you gotta add the time to develop and optimize the library to work as good as a CUDA GPU .

Thats very significant even if it isnt the end all be all. The reason companies continue to buy nvidia is that currently the economics of it are more efficient than labor. Labor is extremely inefficient so its an easy milestone to cross. Think of the buildings and infrastructure and management required for staff. Then there is all the cars driven to work, all the ACs turned on. All of that is the price of labor and its a lot more than just a salary. Datacenters seem inefficient and costly, but the amount of work they do is tremendous and replaces far far far more energy worth of human labor than they cost."

My company have Microsoft CoPilot for engineering to use and nobody touches it If NVDA invests more into AI models beside CUDA similar to OpenAI does, I think they will drive their value much higher.

They actually see their gaming cards as competition for their far higher margin datacentre cards. The inhouse chips, except for googles, have been quite disappointing so far. Most of them havent been costeffective as compared to nvidias cards even when taking into account nvidias margins, arent as easy to scale, and have no compilers or DL frameworks to use around them. Furthermore, in academics theres no such thing as a known dead end for decades. You cant ever definitively rule out an idea, and thats even more so the case when the eras differ in available compute by a factor of a billion. The claim that gpts cant achieve what you suggest is also fundamentally unproven. I think most ai engineers would agree that just next token prediction is not enough for jarvis, but thats been the consensus for years. However, this does not account for all the efforts put into posttraining like RLHF, and selfconsistency.

But GPT read and responded in 5seconds The critique youve provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AIs current trajectory and potential. 1. AI Approaches and Progress The critique dismisses the GPTML approach as a known dead end, but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While its true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fictionlike fantasies e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S., this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT3, GPT4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries. 2. Exponential Investment for Linear Gains The notion of exponential investment for linear gains is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of whats possible. 3. Business Case for AI The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an allencompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decisionmaking, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable. 4. Training Data and Resources Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resourceintensive nature of AI. 5. Nvidias Role While its true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust softwarehardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidias role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete. 6. Investor Expectations The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and longterm potential. In summary, while AIs development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a bubble fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock."

No shit Nvidia cant go up forever and make infinite money. But everyone who buys off them isnt at the point where they are making their own chips and doing their own software, its still all Nvidia right now. I could see OP being right next earnings if their main buyers slow down on AI or make their own shit, but right now Nvidia is still in a more than fantastic position. His general take on AI is off too. The Ford board is NOT looking for the scifi shit he is saying. They ARE looking to replace their customer service with AI. He is ass backwards on this take.

I think you take this a little hyperbolic in places e.g. ML does have real academic applications, including LLMs in select fields that deal with text data, and the whole Jarvis line is kinda ridic tbh but the core point of ballooning costs, fairly anemic use cases, manufacturing teething problems, and absurd current valuations is one I agree on. Its kind of like the Tesla story a couple years ago. Company hits scale in a new market, competition emerges and issues start to crop up, so theres a limit to growth upside. But valuations are assuming fairly substantial continued growth. So the upside is minimal and downside risks are elevated. Not something Id take a huge position on, but worth unwinding long positions and maybe a speculative put or two in a large enough portfolio."

You are also wrong about improvement costs being completely exponential. That is true for the scaling wide increasing parameter count and training time, but scaling vertically is much more efficient. I use the latest models every day for programming and it seems like every week theres something new that can solve some problems the previous model couldnt solve. The current state of the art is focused on improving training and making a corpus of training data have better results. The gains are spectacular. Microsofts Phi 3.5 mini came out last week and has 3.8B parameters. It outperforms Llama 2 70B from a year ago on benchmarks. Thats almost 20x less parameters and possibly training time. They did this by improving training methodology and making training data higher quality. So methodology is leading to huge improvements. Hyper scale companies are continuing to scale wide AND implement these methodologies. This means each generation is getting better and better and we have a while before we get to scraping the bottom of the barrel of the gains."

You can look up what folks like Sam Altman were saying 5 years ago. Here he is in 2019 openly saying they have no real path to profitability and once we make AI good enough itll just tell us how to make a return. A year ago the entire field was bristling with excitement about AGI and superintelligence, its a relatively recent development that theyve walked expectations back. Theyre just doing the fusion power is 5 years away thing. Heres Sam himself talking down GPT4 2 months before it came out and a couple months ago saying its mildly embarrassing at best and heres him saying largely the same thing nearly 6 years ago The current thing is always good enough for some tasks and the true AGI future is just a few years away. The issue isnt that it takes time, the issue is in 2020 when they released GPT3 theyd raised less than 100m, and today theyve raised over 13B, and they dont have a lot to show for that extra 12.9B. Sams talking about burning 50 billion a year to build AGI and its just got people wondering how many rounds well have to go on this before we get whats actually promised. At the end of the day its not his 50 billion to burn, his company isnt profitable so its gotta come from other people who arent going to keep ponying up if theres no progress to show for it. Obviously the AI sector is bigger than OpenAI, but theyre the best example. True AGI would be worth near infinite investment, but 400B for the current state of AI wasnt worth it, the longer this goes the more investors will just see it as throwing good money after bad."

What Im trying to say is that you hit a nice amount so you really gotta be smart about it and not blow it all up. Trust me when I say that 2.5k into SPY or QQQ and then continuously adding on to it from your paychecks like just even 200300 each paycheck get fractional shares will be so rewarding in 25 years. And then whatever funds you use for trading, if you do hit good profits, do the same with your profits Take a good portion of it and invest it. Use the remaining for trading while also adding some to it with your paychecks. Buuuut if you want to speedrun being a millionaire, then by all means go ahead and you do you lol."

A big portion of your current and future paychecks should be dedicated to building your financial foundation. You need a solid base from which you can launch your options plays that you can fall back on when they inevitably blow up. The key is to risk only a small portion of your pay on YOLO shit and never touch your growing stash of investments. Gamble only in the play account, which should never be a sheltered tax advantaged account. And for guhs sake, take the profits when you see them and chop off at least 50 back into the ETFs."

Some people can sell options without owning the shares as well, but usually brokerage requires X amount of money in their account. Usually 25k depending on whichever brokerage company.

You already had a 160,000 QCOM position that would have been either taking an outright loss or an economic loss due to opportunity cost, so the extra 25,000 was entirely a gamble that would have only added to your potential downside. You could received money to take on a position that hedged against your stock losing value, but instead you chose to pay money to make a larger bet. Thats not coherent risk management. And thats great, thats the whole point of this subredditbut dont turn around and then say shit like this Because for every possibility you already gave yourself the impossible. You give yourself reasons why its not possible so you dont have to bother learning on how to do it. You havent learned how to do anything beyond gamble your inheritance away, you absolute turbo degen. All you did was risk a bunch of money on bets. You dont have a strategy to prevent or minimize loss, or if you do you havent showed the positions, so as a result your gains are simply and entirely a byproduct of your own misattributed luck. Youre just a gambler, OP. Get the fuck off your high horse and stop acting like you know how to do anything beyond yoloing your money Congrats on the gains btw edit Good god I just saw your other comment, this actually isnt an inheritance. Youre making some really fast and loose moves with hardearned money here, way to go"

Companies like Dell and Intel have that stale hardware company smell that Lucent did just prior to them tanking. Old companies, serving old markets with old employees. Time to retire them. A couple of observations from someone with 30 years experience in systems engineering One, ATT and Lucent buildings were full of nonproducers, particularly at the PMdirectorexecutive level. I remember one director in particular that had multiple CRTs in his office that showed the tickers for all our vendors stock he had been giftedgrifted. Only time he ever interacted with me was to yell at me when he heard I got offered a bunch of preIPO stock from a vendor and I declined given I felt it was a conflict of Interest. Two, some hardware projects cannot be remote because they need lab workspace. Hardware companies that devote 100 of their real estate to hardware labs and outsource everything else will be more successful than compeditors that dont. Putting employees that dont need to be there offcampus improves the bottom line. Three, Linux is the most successful software engineering and operating system project in human history and has been 100 remote since its inception. It also buriedbankrupted all its commercial Unix competitors. So put that in your pipe and smoke it, regards. Edit If you regards knew what OpenAI actually did your heads would collectively explode."

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects DELL) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of DELL to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

So, an DELL investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects DELL the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for DELL. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

So, a DELL investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects DELL the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for DELL. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like DELL to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax DELL would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of DELL stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on DELL stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on DELL stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."

The S&amp;P 500 index has a forward P/E of 23.58 according to &#34;The Wall Street Journal&#34;. So, if you can believe analysts&#39; estimates, DELL stock is roughly half as expensive as the S&amp;P 500 index on a forward P/E basis. I expect DELL&#39;s earnings per share to grow faster than the S&amp;P 500 aggregate EPS, so that tells me that DELL stock is likely to outperform the S&amp;P 500 index over the coming days, weeks and months.  But, even if DELL&#39;s EPS only grow at the same rate as the S&amp;P 500&#39;s aggregate EPS, DELL stock will probably still outperform the S&amp;P 500 index, because of its much lower valuation.  DELL still trades at a steep discount to the S&amp;P 500, even though it&#39;s a tech stock exposed to the fast-growing AI segment."

Here is the reason they will be able to ship an extraordinary number of servers. There are 5400 Data Centers with another 300 currently being built and with 25 Quintilian bits of data being produced everyday Super Data Centers will be required. That is good news for several chip makers that in addition to NVDA there will be strong demand for more chips and the new Apple phone with AI capability ans the Dell servers and their new Blackwell PC will have strong demand as well .Liars that are proclaiming the slow down of semiconductor chips are very wrong. They want you to sell.sell, sell so they can pickup more chips and drive prices up on the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Clever eh ?Telliing you that it is over and run from big tech. You might want to think about that especially as plans for more power is unveiled. There is a short pause and the growth may not be what it t has been but will lead the market place. In my opinion .A tip off is the potential proposed funding of Sam Altmans company by NVDEA and Apple to kick this up another gear. Sam Altman&#34;s company has a published valuation of $100 Billion. Does this sound lie it is done growing ? Read the conference call notes and study it. This ride has at least 3 strong years left.If you don&#39;t believe it I know better  then make it your informed risk."

That puts the PE at less than 15 for a company with sequential AI server growth at 100%. That’s insane. If Dell manages to control costs and makes a good profit on the AI server sales, we are easily looking at $160 and beyond. If they fail to show good profit for the AI servers yet again, I will be out after earnings next week. Cheers!"

So, if the analysts are anywhere close to being in the ballpark, DELL is a cheap stock.  This stock&#39;s P/E multiple is way below the S&amp;P 500 multiple, even though it has exposure to AI.  If you look at the dispersion, the lowest 2026 eps estimate among the 19 analysts is $8.12.  I&#39;m only pointing out that if the most pessimistic analyst out of the 19 analysts who have estimated DELL&#39;s 2026 earnings is correct, DELL is still a cheap stock at the current valuation."

In the same period, chip stocks have moved up in the market by 3x-10x. DELL&#39;s peer - SMCI has moved 10x. Analysts are all bullish on DELL. Here is a commentary from MS analyst - Erik W Woodring. North America IT Hardware (Erik Woodring): Dell Technologies (Overweight, PT US$155): We believe DELL is the best positioned company in our Hardware coverage to benefit from ramping accelerated compute demand/orders from Tier 2 CSPs, sovereigns and enterprises, as well as other data center modernization efforts across storage and services. Our checks continue to show that DELL&#39;s AI server business is gaining momentum and taking share, with component vendors and assembly partners signaling 50k HGX AI server builds for DELL in CY24, suggesting our forecast for 40k AI server shipments (~$11B of AI server revenue) in FY25 could prove conservative. This momentum reflects not only repeat purchases from existing customers, but also key competitive wins in the T2 CSP market, an emerging sovereign opportunity, and building enterprise AI server demand that we believe can drive revenue growth and operating leverage into CY25 (FY26), and an 21% total return CAGR over the next 3 years. At 10x our FY26 EPS, and 8.6x our FY26 bull case EPS, and with a catalyst in S&amp;P inclusion ahead (timing unknown), we believe valuation is extremely attractive at current"

That will take years for that to happen, especially since Dell is laying off thousands.  It will take years before Dell is comfortably reorganized and everyone is on the same page and productive.  Wow.  I would suggest selling and if one wants to remain the tech sector I suggest buying TSM and PLTR. TSM is also beat up and manufactures semiconductors for a most of the electronic companies and is moving towards 2nm semiconductors.  I would also buy PLTR.  Their AI software is best in class and they have and are getting military contracts.  Given all of the issues in the world today the military contracts will benefit PLTR greatly."
