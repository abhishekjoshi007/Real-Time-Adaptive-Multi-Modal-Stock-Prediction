As a data scientist thats been following PLTR for 5 years, I feel like I have a good grasp so here it is in as few words as possible They are data consultants that have proprietary productivity tools that are allegedly better than the rest. Their tools are highly opinionated, as in they force you to setup your data in a way that is amenable to the way their software analyzes data. Highly opinionated means less flexibility, and this is the complete opposite of what the industry is doing, which is to maximize flexibility by offering every niche solution as a SaaS product and hiring a bunch of data engineers to do the custom integration. Bull case is that their productivity tools are not only top tier but also scalable, as in they can become more of a monolithic SaaS company and less of a consulting company over the next few years. Also, if anyone figures out how to manage autonomous agents that can execute business logic within organizations, its going to be MSFT or PLTR. Sorry AMZN, GOOG, and CRM. Bear case is that their productivity tools are just mid and the secret sauce is their forward deployed engineers that get paid enormous salaries at the expense of stock holders, which would make them an overpriced consulting company.",Positive,1,0.9528138041496277,Reply

It might improve bottom line but it certainly wont help the top. Also cuts usually results in worse service. Dell lives and dies with service contracts. No one actually cares about their brand of products. They are actually annoying due to adding propietary crap. Companies use Dell because they are approved by government and offer long term service contracts while being unlikely to go out of business within contract terms. Are cuts going to make their service worse? On top of all that, the markets are bloated right now so not exactly the best time to start positions. Are they doing anything else worth note aside from cuts? Takeover is not likely at this valuation. Who has 80b laying around for a low margin business that is historically inconsistent. Is there even a company out there that has synergy with them to integrate them? Only thing I can think of is GPU and CPU makers? But they dont have that kind of cash laying around. A merger maybe? But I think Dell is the one who will have to make concessions, not the other way... unless its Intel lol.",Negative,-1,0.6237620115280151,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-25,"Point of View from a network engineerglorified tech support To be honest I love Dell, both their server and endpoints build quality is pretty good and their customer support is also great where I am. I propose Dell whenever I can by default. But truth is, their MSRP vs reseller price margin is relatively low compared to other manufacturers which means less incentives to promote and sell their products. Dell also recently revised their pricing up early aug which made them even worst off and less competitive now. One thing that I hate is they sold off VMware to Broadcom late last year, for those who dont know, in the tech world Broadcom is known to take over companies or good products and drives the prices up so much and fire off good support and developersread senior and expensive and make everything about , eventually driving the product to the drain. VMware has such good potential and is so widely adopted that if Dell just held and invest in it, it can be one of their core products. But no they just sold if off and earning vendettas from the tech world. Hardware demand is slowing in the consumer end, honestly the software developments over the years doesnt make replacing your laptop that urgent anymore. For normal office work, you can work as well on a 5 year old laptop compared to a new one now where as it use to be have an excel file running for 5min vs 1min for a 2005 laptop vs a 2010 laptop, now its both 30s for a 2019 laptop and 2024 laptop. For the AI hype, well, there maybe a chance for ppl to want to replace their laptops if microsoft or some third party software company coming up with some good implementation of locally processed AI workload but even then Dell is still just one of the options.

Reddit,2024-08-08,"Prior to doing deep research on Dell, it appears that Dell is another hype name that got a valuation boost due to partnership with NVDA. Then we realise from Dell latest layoffs that they had a margin problem, and it seems that NVDA still hold most of the power in the margin game. This meant that the partnership is a slow growth on their earnings, not as fast as one would expect. Still the partnership should continue and this lay off maybe to weed the firm of bloat that cant grow their new data center offerings.

Im not knowledgeable enough to understand some of what you have explained so my questions may be rather basic. It sounds like you were trading options, which I understand on a basic level, but do not yet have the confidence to trade them, and unless I got in on a penny stock before it ballooned, the methods of trading I use buy and hold, no options, I dont think it is even possible to achieve the returns people like you post as I believe you are risking more loss potential for greater gains with calls. Now if I am correct so far, what is the ELI5 ROI difference between the trades youre placing and the ones I am placing? For instance, if you just bought and sold basic shares instead of buying options, I suspect you would have 110th or less of the return you have.

Reddit,2024-08-27,"Out of curiosity, I have a question for you. I remember you had talked about potentially selling covered calls on LUNR coming up and this was something I was also considering I have 500 shares. However, Ive recently learned that covered calls are best sold if you think the stock is going to remain flat andor decline some. So covered calls are actually a bearish trading strategy? So lets say I expect LUNR to go to 10 over the next 45 months, through the next launch which I basically do, and would be curious your thoughts on this point. Would selling covered calls actually not be the thing to do in this scenario then? Because we are bullish on it for next few months? Or do we sell covered calls for like a year or two out maybe? Because we know it will drop back down at some point after next launch and probably continue up and down some for next year before it starts really taking off?

Some funsies Income tax does go up to 52 here though, so my employer pays out part of my salary in mealcheques which is subtracted from your gross before the taxman comes. So my groceries are untaxed except for VAT. Same with ecocheques which you can spend on green things, and Consumption cheques which you can spend on just about anything. Its some weird government facilitated tax evasion scheme. More funnies No capital gains tax in Belgium as long as you dont do daytrading or speculativehigh risk trading.

Dividends are taxed at 30 if you go above 800 a year.

Reddit,2024-08-27,"Its not really so simple as rates go down, markets go up, and you have to see the larger market context. In a strong growth environment, rate cuts might typically give a stock market boost, but in a weakening soft landing economy, they can do the opposite, a brief spike up and reversal notwithstanding. Additional rate cuts can precede even more market drop, but there truly isnt a direct universal correlation, because its about larger context. Look at 2007, which is a similar analog to today in some ways prior to rate cuts in Sept, the market dropped 23 weeks and we may see that again here, then markets surged on the cut announcement, went up to new all time highs which we may also see again here as of SeptOct, like SP to 5800? 5900?. After the all time high peak, stocks then started their 18 month drop, even as rates kept dropping in salvage mode. Here now, the SP could easily touch 3900 into next year before a strong rebound, based on chart setups. No guarantees of course, but hence why I think its best to wait and watch a bit, risk is legitimately high going forward here. Watch the bond rates too, which are a leading indicator to the Fed funds rate or watch TLT going upward ahead as an inverse, it is set up to continue a new up trend. Fed rate changes always lag, but the bond rates dropping are also cluing in a weak economy ahead, not strong. Rate cuts in this environment actually reduce govt interest expenditure which is a massive source of liquidity that gets funneled into markets, essentially draining liquidity that the markets need to keep going up, and spurredon private borrowing on lower rates if it even happens isnt going to overpower that in a weakening environment. Similar to 2007 as well, and 2000, the technical chart pattern itself in each major index, SPX, NQ, RTY is now one of completing a multiyear run pattern, and at a large degree scale, not midrun or starting a new run. I think a lot of people feel like its 201617 about to repeat, rather than 2000 or 200708. But this is a different market context now than the last 1012 years, much more akin to 2007 in pattern, or more so 2000 in context and aftermath or even 1929, but I doubt we see any straight plunge like 29, more like a grind down and up with multiple plunges. There are no crystal balls obviously, just correlated clues and patterns, but together it hints at a rough riskreward skew going forward, and a rough frustrating and quite volatile buyandhold environment for the next decade, like holding through the 1970s or 2000s, maybe worse, though there would surely be some very strong swings upward.",Neutral,-1,0.9217903912067413,Reply

Probably a bit flat for a while maybe a small loss and then onward with regular expected growth.

Reddit,2024-08-26,"I figured you were new, thats okay. Try to learn as much as you can about options before you waste your cash. There is a metric to options, several actually, but one in particular called implied volatility IV for short. Iv plays a factor into options price, and iv is driven by expected events that would drive market price. Earnings is a big one, dates of known contract announcements or company announcements. The market knows all of this and tracks it through IV. The closer you get to these events, the IV will rise, causing the price of an option to rise with it. So by buying options for known events as far away from them as you can stomach, the cheaper you can get that same option for. You have to balance that with how much you think the price will change before that event though. Options are simple yet complicated. So if you buy an option today for earnings tomorrow, it will likely be as expensive as that option gets. Starting the moment the event happens, the iv begins to drop dramatically, lowering the price of the option. This is known as iv crush if you have heard that term used.",Neutral,0,0.9999313354492188,Reply

But if you look at QoQ, QoQ revenue growth rate has been slowing QoQ revenue growth was 15, which is a lowering percentage that previous QoQ growths not Nvidias fault... its just that the law of large numbers is a bitch. Now that we got that out of the way.

If Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla decide to not increase their spending on AI GPUs that much more from here or cut back on it, then RIP Nvidia. Following the previous point, why would they possibly not increase their spending that much more or even cut it?

Throughout history, almost every time there is a big spike in speculative demand... the demand exceeding supply soon turns into supply exceeding demand. Having said that, yes, AI is the future bro.

Even if we agreed that theres power concerns, fiscal concerns, concerns with the overall model of AI, concerns about chip manufacturing and ability Its unlikely any of that is on the ballot on the 28th. Whats going to be the concern is revenues for this quarter hitting towards the top end of expectations or exceeding it and then projections for the upcoming quarters Now maybe some of those issues feed into projections but I sort of doubt it. These are longer term problems, so Id be more willing to bet they become an issue over the next 6 to 18 months rather than in 3 days. So its a pretty regarded take to make based on the thesis.

They perform far worst and there are not many libraries available so now you create two problems . The lack of support from libraries creates a difficult where you gonna have to either write your own library which requires time and resources from engineers or use the libraries that are already available but you have to jump through so many hoops to make it work and guess less performance that now you wasted time and money . Lets say you try to hire the top of line engineer most of them already have experience with CUDA , if not its easy enough to learn but if you go anywhere else and try to build in house now you gotta add the time to develop and optimize the library to work as good as a CUDA GPU .

The successes of GPT3, GPT4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries. 2. Exponential Investment for Linear Gains The notion of exponential investment for linear gains is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of whats possible. 3. Business Case for AI The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an allencompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decisionmaking, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable. 4. Training Data and Resources Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resourceintensive nature of AI. 5. Nvidias Role While its true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust softwarehardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidias role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete. 6. Investor Expectations The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and longterm potential. In summary, while AIs development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a bubble fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock.",Positive,2,0.8755164742469788,Reply

You are also wrong about improvement costs being completely exponential. That is true for the scaling wide increasing parameter count and training time, but scaling vertically is much more efficient. I use the latest models every day for programming and it seems like every week theres something new that can solve some problems the previous model couldnt solve. The current state of the art is focused on improving training and making a corpus of training data have better results. The gains are spectacular. Microsofts Phi 3.5 mini came out last week and has 3.8B parameters. It outperforms Llama 2 70B from a year ago on benchmarks. Thats almost 20x less parameters and possibly training time. They did this by improving training methodology and making training data higher quality. So methodology is leading to huge improvements. Hyper scale companies are continuing to scale wide AND implement these methodologies.

You need a solid base from which you can launch your options plays that you can fall back on when they inevitably blow up. The key is to risk only a small portion of your pay on YOLO shit and never touch your growing stash of investments.

Reddit,2024-08-08,"I wrote about this extensively in a prior post. I was at Bell LabsLucent just prior to the implosion. Companies like Dell and Intel have that stale hardware company smell that Lucent did just prior to them tanking. Old companies, serving old markets with old employees. Time to retire them. A couple of observations from someone with 30 years experience in systems engineering One, ATT and Lucent buildings were full of nonproducers, particularly at the PMdirectorexecutive level. I remember one director in particular that had multiple CRTs in his office that showed the tickers for all our vendors stock he had been giftedgrifted. Only time he ever interacted with me was to yell at me when he heard I got offered a bunch of preIPO stock from a vendor and I declined given I felt it was a conflict of Interest. Two, some hardware projects cannot be remote because they need lab workspace. Hardware companies that devote 100 of their real estate to hardware labs and outsource everything else will be more successful than compeditors that dont. Putting employees that dont need to be there offcampus improves the bottom line. Three, Linux is the most successful software engineering and operating system project in human history and has been 100 remote since its inception. It also buriedbankrupted all its commercial Unix competitors. So put that in your pipe and smoke it, regards.

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects DELL) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of DELL to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous.

So, a DELL investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects DELL the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor.

So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on DELL stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on DELL stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.

So, if you can believe analysts&#39; estimates, DELL stock is roughly half as expensive as the S&amp;P 500 index on a forward P/E basis. I expect DELL&#39;s earnings per share to grow faster than the S&amp;P 500 aggregate EPS, so that tells me that DELL stock is likely to outperform the S&amp;P 500 index over the coming days, weeks and months.  But, even if DELL&#39;s EPS only grow at the same rate as the S&amp;P 500&#39;s aggregate EPS, DELL stock will probably still outperform the S&amp;P 500 index, because of its much lower valuation.

Here is the reason they will be able to ship an extraordinary number of servers. There are 5400 Data Centers with another 300 currently being built and with 25 Quintilian bits of data being produced everyday Super Data Centers will be required. That is good news for several chip makers that in addition to NVDA there will be strong demand for more chips and the new Apple phone with AI capability ans the Dell servers and their new Blackwell PC will have strong demand as well .Liars that are proclaiming the slow down of semiconductor chips are very wrong. They want you to sell.sell, sell so they can pickup more chips and drive prices up on the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Clever eh ?Telliing you that it is over and run from big tech. You might want to think about that especially as plans for more power is unveiled. There is a short pause and the growth may not be what it t has been but will lead the market place.

In the same period, chip stocks have moved up in the market by 3x-10x. DELL&#39;s peer - SMCI has moved 10x. Analysts are all bullish on DELL. Here is a commentary from MS analyst - Erik W Woodring. North America IT Hardware (Erik Woodring): Dell Technologies (Overweight, PT US$155): We believe DELL is the best positioned company in our Hardware coverage to benefit from ramping accelerated compute demand/orders from Tier 2 CSPs, sovereigns and enterprises, as well as other data center modernization efforts across storage and services. Our checks continue to show that DELL&#39;s AI server business is gaining momentum and taking share, with component vendors and assembly partners signaling 50k HGX AI server builds for DELL in CY24, suggesting our forecast for 40k AI server shipments (~$11B of AI server revenue) in FY25 could prove conservative. This momentum reflects not only repeat purchases from existing customers, but also key competitive wins in the T2 CSP market, an emerging sovereign opportunity, and building enterprise AI server demand that we believe can drive revenue growth and operating leverage into CY25 (FY26), and an 21% total return CAGR over the next 3 years. At 10x our FY26 EPS, and 8.6x our FY26 bull case EPS, and with a catalyst in S&amp;P inclusion ahead (timing unknown), we believe valuation is extremely attractive at current",Positive,1,1.0,Main
