Yahoo,2024-10-30,"Policy goes into effect November 8.

China’s policies on solar production are moving closer to implementation, as both the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) have confirmed draft regulations that focus on controlling overcapacity, encouraging higher efficiency, and improving environmental standards within the photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing sector.

For PV manufacturing, the MIIT’s new guidelines target reducing overcapacity by enforcing strict efficiency benchmarks and minimum capital requirements for new projects, aiming to drive more responsible and sustainable growth. Companies that cannot meet these requirements might face shutdowns, likely consolidating the industry and enhancing product quality ￼ ￼.

The NEA has also proposed changes in the distributed solar market, introducing new categories and limiting grid access options for large-scale commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) solar projects. The draft mandates unique identification codes for projects and introduces a green certificate system that financially rewards clean energy. These policies, open for public feedback until November 8, suggest a clear intent from the Chinese government to curb the rapid, unchecked expansion of solar production, particularly in response to market oversupply and price drops over recent years ￼ ￼.

The shift in policy is designed to prevent market disruption from overcapacity while promoting sustainable industry growth in China, though it could slow immediate expansion in certain sectors.",Positive,1,0.4754568636417389,Main

Its seems csiq is concentrating on building and running its own solar plants while managing and selling the power to businesses or utilities in long term agreements. And ditto for battery storage. I like that strategy. I can see large data centers or manufacturers adopting this type of partnership. Right now they are in the zone where they do not have enough plants running and bringing in revenue to support new plants and profit. And the net income from selling panels is not providing free cash flow for projects. 

I do not feel solar panels on individual homes will ever make it. At least in US. Not sure about overseas. Instead they should approach the DR Horton partnership with their existing strategy. Construct one solar plant(field) to support ALL the houses in the project with a long term agreement.

They may need to do a merger in order to continue to grow? CSIQ does not seem to be growing quick enough to handle all the cost of construction. In the end they need the solar panel prices to rise like everything else.",Neutral,0,0.9967967867851257,Main
