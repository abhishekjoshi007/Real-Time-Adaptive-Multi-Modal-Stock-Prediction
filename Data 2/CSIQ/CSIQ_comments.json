Companies that cannot meet these requirements might face shutdowns, likely consolidating the industry and enhancing product quality ￼ ￼.\n\nThe NEA has also proposed changes in the distributed solar market, introducing new categories and limiting grid access options for large-scale commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) solar projects. The draft mandates unique identification codes for projects and introduces a green certificate system that financially rewards clean energy. These policies, open for public feedback until November 8, suggest a clear intent from the Chinese government to curb the rapid, unchecked expansion of solar production, particularly in response to market oversupply and price drops over recent years ￼ ￼.\n\nThe shift in policy is designed to prevent market disruption from overcapacity while promoting sustainable industry growth in China, though it could slow immediate expansion in certain sectors."

If both Trump winning the election and weak earnings occur, it might easily drop to 8 or even lower.If it ever reaches that level, I&#39;ll be buying with both hands and just holding for 4 years :D"

The biggest fear factor for this stock comes down to a saturated Solar market, in which investors buy USA solar stocks (look, FSLR, ENPH, RUN). The other issue is interest rates are not at a level investors view as positive. Finally, the shorts are winning this battle (hedge fund money). At the end of day, there are just better stocks to invest in. The only wild card will be if China actually announces concrete stimulus. But they will most likely wait 30 days until the USA election occurs. Last word, I am a buyer in this range. I&#39;ve owned this stock for 15 years. It has done these cycles of long term down, short term ups. Good luck to the CSIQ investors."

CSI (688472) listed Shanghai, the company majority owned by this stock, trades at around $5.8 billion market cap (41 billion Yuan). So, around $3.5 billion market cap respectively for CSIQ putting the equivalent US stock price at around $60, higher if one factors in Recurrent Energy (Blackrock invested $500 million for 20% stake, so another potential £2 billion in CSIQ valuation, or another $35 in stock price terms, added together over $90). CSIQ market cap $0.9 billion, Nasdaq $13. CSI Shanghai risen around 75% in 3 months, CSIQ has lost about 20%, no recognition of recent events at all. As Rusty just stated, that is the problem; the Short position is massive, 16% of float, meaning this stock is being manipulated to protect catastrophic losses for shorts.  If this stock went to $60 and higher, which it absolutely will over the coming years, too quickly, too many will be trapped.  And that is the problem.  In the meantime, my advice would be to pick up more cheap stock."

Anything the market loves gets huge over valuations. ENPH builds power inverters and quickly moved to battery storage like CSIQ because inverters just aint enough. CSIQ is viewed as Chinese company. More xenophobia and propaganda hurts share price. Reality is CSIQ is spending cash flow on building plants in US. Plants to produce their best in class bifacial modules. So the China label is unjustified. Especially since it is based in Canada. But we all know analysts follow the herd and do not try to 2nd guess it. It is funny how our corporations out source everything to China but the market only punishes certain companies. The industry has huge headwinds due to Oil, gas, and utilities fighting it as much as possible. Therefore shares are manipulated to take advantage of that."

Gravitating towards a low priced stock because I thought it&#39;s oversold &amp; will outperform going forward. Not always, but far more often than not, companies that are doing well, continue to do so, while those that are doing poorly, continue to do so.What I love about real figures like I showed above, is that unlike people who post on these message boards, &amp; the research analysts who cover the stock, they have no feelings/emotions and they can&#39;t lie.Regards"

Revenue for the year will be 6 to 7B. The market cap sits at 1B.\n\nIts seems csiq is concentrating on building and running its own solar plants while managing and selling the power to businesses or utilities in long term agreements. And ditto for battery storage. I like that strategy. I can see large data centers or manufacturers adopting this type of partnership. Right now they are in the zone where they do not have enough plants running and bringing in revenue to support new plants and profit. And the net income from selling panels is not providing free cash flow for projects. \n\nI do not feel solar panels on individual homes will ever make it. At least in US. Not sure about overseas. Instead they should approach the DR Horton partnership with their existing strategy. Construct one solar plant(field) to support ALL the houses in the project with a long term agreement.\n\nThey may need to do a merger in order to continue to grow? CSIQ does not seem to be growing quick enough to handle all the cost of construction. In the end they need the solar panel prices to rise like everything else."

These notes carry a 6% annual interest rate and can be converted into shares later, potentially leading to a 14.2% dilution of the current share base if fully converted.However, this dilution would only make financial sense for PAG if the share price grows to $18.20, which is 23.4% above the current price of $14.75. This means that, even with potential dilution, we could still see a net gain of 9.2%: Net Gain = 23.4% (Price Appreciation) - 14.2% (Dilution) = 9.2% ProfitAdditionally, this action reflects confidence from a major Asia Pacific investment firm that Canadian Solar&#39;s shares are likely to appreciate to at least $18.20, reinforcing the for future growth—definitely a positive sign.The market is reacting negatively in the premarket, likely not fully understanding the whole picture. This presents a potential opportunity for us to capitalize on the situation.There is also earnings report this Thursday. Great opportunities to buy before the interest rate cut in September."
