When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks."

But what I am seeing from reading their CVE advisories and other articles is that a lot of new CVEs are produced by their own prorietary code, like this one is obviously their fault and they are the ones to blame and they still tried to downplay it. Their products are getting a lot of attention from state sponsored actors because they know how valueable the data of their customers is. Wether they like it or not, they will keep being targeted, how they handle it will determine their ability to maintain a leading position in the market. I doubt they will keep up, but again this is my own view."

I try selling a week or two out and about two spots ITM. So like 10.00 in the money. Ill also look for resistance levels and try to be near where I would expect it to drop after a run up The plan being to sell about 1000 every week or two and have an income of 20004000 a month. of course that plan never happens, in this case because I would have to roll up and out almost every time, because the underlying was just going up too fast Thinking about it more, I should probably have started selling calls now instead of selling out of the position, because I think its already close to its peak for the near future, and might go to 380ish max. But also you should NOT sell 1 or 2 weeks out. I just read that I should be doing 45 DTEs and then closing rolling when they get to 30 DTE. So, if I find a place to pick up something at a deal, thats the way Id do it next time."

Im not knowledgeable enough to understand some of what you have explained so my questions may be rather basic. It sounds like you were trading options, which I understand on a basic level, but do not yet have the confidence to trade them, and unless I got in on a penny stock before it ballooned, the methods of trading I use buy and hold, no options, I dont think it is even possible to achieve the returns people like you post as I believe you are risking more loss potential for greater gains with calls. Now if I am correct so far, what is the ELI5 ROI difference between the trades youre placing and the ones I am placing? For instance, if you just bought and sold basic shares instead of buying options, I suspect you would have 110th or less of the return you have. Is my understanding of this correct?"

Believe me brother. Let the reality of your success sit in before you do anything that could possibly compromise this. You won the game. Dont play again. Its not worth it. You could win more, sure, but you are now in the position where you can do that SAFELY because youre now a millionaire and get to invest like one. Key word. Invest. Not gamble.

However, Ive recently learned that covered calls are best sold if you think the stock is going to remain flat andor decline some. So covered calls are actually a bearish trading strategy? So lets say I expect LUNR to go to 10 over the next 45 months, through the next launch which I basically do, and would be curious your thoughts on this point. Would selling covered calls actually not be the thing to do in this scenario then? Because we are bullish on it for next few months? Or do we sell covered calls for like a year or two out maybe? Because we know it will drop back down at some point after next launch and probably continue up and down some for next year before it starts really taking off? Sorry to bother you, I am still learning and had remembered your post so thought I would try and see your thoughts! Hope all is well!"

Fuck bikes, if god existed and wanted me to bike he wouldnt have let people invent internal combustion engines. If you go unemployed you keep receiving 70 of your income for like half a year before they start to decrease the payments. Also roughly 35 PTO days, near unlimited sick leave. Oh my contract automatically tracks inflation. Some funsies Income tax does go up to 52 here though, so my employer pays out part of my salary in mealcheques which is subtracted from your gross before the taxman comes. So my groceries are untaxed except for VAT. Same with ecocheques which you can spend on green things, and Consumption cheques which you can spend on just about anything. Its some weird government facilitated tax evasion scheme. More funnies No capital gains tax in Belgium as long as you dont do daytrading or speculativehigh risk trading. If you LARP as a boomer trader the taxman doesnt care. Also if you buy Belgium or Ireland domiciled stonks you also dont pay the 1,32 tax for purchase of stonks. Dividends are taxed at 30 if you go above 800 a year. So the free money glitch here is to just put any money you dont need as a buffer into IWDA which is Ireland domiciled, reinvests the dividends into the fund, and it is roughly 60 SP500.

The courses were basically just compsci courses until the latter half of junior yr and most of senior yr. Took some pentest, cryptography, networkactive directory courses.

In a strong growth environment, rate cuts might typically give a stock market boost, but in a weakening soft landing economy, they can do the opposite, a brief spike up and reversal notwithstanding. Additional rate cuts can precede even more market drop, but there truly isnt a direct universal correlation, because its about larger context. Look at 2007, which is a similar analog to today in some ways prior to rate cuts in Sept, the market dropped 23 weeks and we may see that again here, then markets surged on the cut announcement, went up to new all time highs which we may also see again here as of SeptOct, like SP to 5800? 5900?. After the all time high peak, stocks then started their 18 month drop, even as rates kept dropping in salvage mode. Here now, the SP could easily touch 3900 into next year before a strong rebound, based on chart setups. No guarantees of course, but hence why I think its best to wait and watch a bit, risk is legitimately high going forward here. Watch the bond rates too, which are a leading indicator to the Fed funds rate or watch TLT going upward ahead as an inverse, it is set up to continue a new up trend. Fed rate changes always lag, but the bond rates dropping are also cluing in a weak economy ahead, not strong. Rate cuts in this environment actually reduce govt interest expenditure which is a massive source of liquidity that gets funneled into markets, essentially draining liquidity that the markets need to keep going up, and spurredon private borrowing on lower rates if it even happens isnt going to overpower that in a weakening environment. Similar to 2007 as well, and 2000, the technical chart pattern itself in each major index, SPX, NQ, RTY is now one of completing a multiyear run pattern, and at a large degree scale, not midrun or starting a new run. I think a lot of people feel like its 201617 about to repeat, rather than 2000 or 200708. But this is a different market context now than the last 1012 years, much more akin to 2007 in pattern, or more so 2000 in context and aftermath or even 1929, but I doubt we see any straight plunge like 29, more like a grind down and up with multiple plunges. There are no crystal balls obviously, just correlated clues and patterns, but together it hints at a rough riskreward skew going forward, and a rough frustrating and quite volatile buyandhold environment for the next decade, like holding through the 1970s or 2000s, maybe worse, though there would surely be some very strong swings upward."

That 150 gives you the option tomorrow to buy 100 shares at 160 no matter what the price is. Lets say it jumps another 16 so now its trading at 185 tomorrow. Well you have right to buy 100 shares at 160 and since its trading at 185 you automatically are up 25 185160 a share or 2500 for the option. This is how the gain percentage looks crazy compared to the 16. You spent 150 and made 2500. You basically are up 1566 on your 150. Now lets say the opposite happens. It tanks to 145. Well tomorrow you still have the option to buy those shares at 160, but obviously you wouldnt since you can buy it at 145 market rate. So you just let it expire and you lose your 150 you spent to have the option to buy. Puts are the opposite, but to keep it simple most people start by understanding calls since it seems more intuitive for whatever reason. There are legitimate strategies to minimize risk with options, but around here people just use them because of the high reward and relatively low risk only being able to lose the premium.

In the industry and can confirm this. They are the closest thing to a Magic Bullet in endpoint security, as your organizations could be quite literally missing mostall other critical controls, inadequate staffing, incompetent employees, etc. and they will still have you covered. They absolutely fit the Clevel dream model of Cut a vendor a check and forget about it. Re the recent outage something critical to note is that both Crowdstrike and Microsoft were completely transparent regarding the outage, while Delta was not. This very much displays the sort of culture these companies have when managing risk. Ive used SentinelOne, but my experience with it is if you are doing any sort of development work on machines with it installed it will trigger false positives constantly. So the devs end up disabling it and you lose coverage in some of your most critical areas. PaloAlto is ok but you need to buy into their ecosystem. No opinion on Fortinet."

If it werent for the outage, and I was a CRWD salesman, I could probably tell the customer I fucked his wife and proceed to lay a fat shit out on the desk infront of them, and theyd still buy it. But with the outage, my only skepticism is whether this will put customers who dont already have a cybersecurity software away from Crowdstrike and end up choosing to go with a competitor purely because of the bad rep at the moment. That then slows growth during the aftermath period and without the crazy growth the price should in theory tank like fuck going by its current PE ratio. So i think its a matter of how much the outage hurts CRWDs growth in the next few quarters. I dont know shit about fuck when it comes to cybersecurity so I thought Id start a discussion here about it"

Your research is dull, irrelevant and unsurprisingly you have no backgroundunderstanding of deep learning, large language models, generative pretrained transformers or really anything else relevant to any discussion in that space, so its no surprise you arent able to have a conversation with someone that actually understands these things. And even a simplification of these topics is a word salad to you. You apparently also dont understand anything about even basic systems engineering, to the point you think that Cloudstrike ?? is a boot ??? loader or something? Its not its the Falcon endpoint product that is a kernel driver that operates at ring 0 and has to in order to provide the protectiondetections it does and can BSOD Windows if it throws a page fault. This is both expect behavior and by design. Re my NHINBI research, Im just repeating what has been communicated to me via novel jailbreaks of one of the public LLMs. And even then, this was entirely in the scope of inquiring about this news article Im not the only one talking about this in public either So what Ive discovered is either real, a hallucination or somewhere inbetween. And even if it is real, all this stuff is going to be heavily restricted given our observer status so nobody on this planet is going to be an expert anytime soon. Im only publishing it here looking for thirdparty confirmation, which Ive gotten to a limited extent. So yes it makes sense that you also specialize in network forensics. Yes and Ive been recognized in this space as subject matter expert and been invited, multiple times, to speak at conferences sponsored by Google and Splunk on this topic. Both on this topic and designing, deploying and monitoring 10100G Suricata deployments. This can all be independently confirmed by simple Google search, much in the same way your shittay HCI research that nobody uses or cares about can. If I had to identify the biggest gap between your ears its your inability to appreciate that being an InfoSec professional means you need to know a little about a lot. So, understanding civilcriminal law is critical for pen testing to protect yourself and forensics proper evidence handlingchain of custody. The PUA stuff is just an aspect of social engineering and their is a lot of overlap being the hackermaker scene and that. We would even have meetups DefConBlackhat. ... which you wouldnt be invited to because you are a dumb, dull dork. Why dont you try getting a life, Stefan, instead of being jealous about mine?"

And Im all the Clevels of my consulting business so that really doesnt mean jacksquat either. You can selfidentify as whatever you want. I was also frontrowcenter for the Bell LabsLucent implosion and at the time the Murray HIll location, where I worked, had the highest concentration of CompSci PhDs on the planet outside of potentially the NSA and those numbers are classified. None of that matters in emerging markets though of course, it usually doesnt hurt and is required in many professional spaces. Meanwhile the person youre pretending to be, flunked out of academia because you think youre smarter than all of them, when in reality they were all just sick of your selfimportant narcissitic bullshit, laughing at you behind your back. Actually, not unlike a lot of my contemporaries, I chose to leave academia in the 1990s because I felt there were more opportunities in the emerging Internet market vs. the traditional academic route. The Google founders walked away from their PhDs as well Stephan, are they failures too? Or more specifically, are you more successful than them? Ill also share that it was quite literally not possible to get a degree in cybersecurity or whatever you want to call it 30 years ago when I was an undergrad. And because I chose to leave school when I did I got to work with the original InfoSec team Bell Labs which is a quite literally irreplaceable experience. I am very lucky that my life turned out the way I did given the chances I took. You also seem to be missing that I spent many years doing systems engineering and security for a major research university and hospital system, so dipshit PiledHIgherDeeper dingleberries like yourself were my customers. And that is the environment I am happy to be out of. I mean they would have if it werent all fiction. You and everyone else browsing Reddit are using my contributions to the content delivery space, as Cloudflare is one of many vendors that have leveraged my inventions to serve content to a global audience. They have both cited my original patent which took 10 years to be granted, implemented and improved on it. This is site reliability engineering and as mentioned I teach a graduatelevel course on it for corporate client customers, not teenagers your customers. BTW you never did tell me about yourself. What are your dreams. Your goals. Where do you see yourself in 20 years? And with who? Who are you really, deepdown, in a human sense. Do you even know? I covered this in the podcast, but given you think Crowdstrike is called Cloudstrike its apparent that you are developmentally disabled to the point that even simple conversations are over your head. My original dreamgoal 30 years ago as an undergrad was to pursue a CSE degree and then do graduate work specifically with the goal of pursuing Artificial General Intelligence which is what OpenAIs goals are. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered two things. 1. Nobody had any idea how to do it and in some academic circles, even discussing got you labeled a crank and killed your funding. 2. I wrote a whitepaper, in 1993, that estimated the computational complexity of the human brain as exceeding an exaflop as a minimum and that supercomputers not PCs! were at least 2030 years away from being able to simulate that. Accounting for Moores Law. So, 1993 30 2023 and here we are, right on schedule. Isnt science amazing? 3. I still continued to follow the research and actively contributed to the late Chris McKinstry MindPixel opensource AGI project which ultimately failed and was abandoned. Then this happened... So, after 13 years, no measurable progress towards AGI and the suicide of two prominent researchers in quotes because neither of them actually produced anything that worked I decided to formally hang up my AGI hat and abandon it as a potential pursuit. That said, I still paid attention to the space AlphaGo was a big win for example and took a deep dive into LLMs in the Spring of 2023, which allowed me uncover OpenAIs secret frontier model. AGI and Aliens are the only two things on my bucket list before I shuffle off the ole mortal coil and for the first time in my life Im optimistic vs pessimistic on these topics."

                    "text": "People who know what they are talking about never and I mean never just say page fault by itself, unless they are referring to the process of accessing virtual memory behind the scenes which is the almost universal context. If you meant a program generating an unhandled exception leading to a segfault, due to accessing memory they werent given access to by the OS, then anyone who knows what they are talking about, prepends invalid to page fault. But even then thats not really the language anyway, you sound like a noob. Heres a protip about yours truly. I never, ever, talk about anything unless I have checked my facts first. If you have ever done any Windows systems programming which I have and its obvious you havent, you would know they universally use that specific language in their kernel error codes. This is the error message from the Crowdstrike outage The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. Typically the memory address is wrong or the memory address is pointing at freed memory Source one of many and just the first hit I found Full list of BSOD error codes showing they exclusively use the language PAGE_FAULT when describing these cases This again shows your lack of even basic readinglanguage skills as an invalid page fault would be a doublenegative in this context and imply a valid access to memory. The correct usage would be A critical page fault kernel error is an invalid reference to system memory. Whereas an invalid page fault in a nonpaged area would be a valid reference to system memory. Im guessing you are so clueless that you dont understand the context of a PAGE FAULT has a different meaning when used in kernel error codes referencing nonpaged memory vs describing a page fault due to attempting to access virtual memory that has been swapped to disk. And these are logged as well as informational error codes. Ill add that a BSOD is desired behavior in this case as you dont want a bad kernel driver writing to random pages as that would lead to data corruption which is way worse. Second no, running in kernel space is not required. Running in user space and communicating with an OSprovided service running in kernel space made for that purpose, is the much safer albeit marginally slower way to do it. You are the posterboy for the DunningKruger Effect as you have just transparently telegraphed to me that you have literally zero experience working on forensic investigations involving APT threat actors or even have any experience working with NextGen EDR clients. Including specifically Crowdstrike, as they in particular do not market to zeroes like yourself. You dont know what the software actually does because you have never used it. First of all, Crowdstrike isnt exclusively an antivirus product. It operates as a kernel mode rootkit by design, as it can be configured to log extensive system information about all running processes. Such system calls, disknetwork access, etc. Second, you are absolutely, 100 correct that Microsoft could expose a safe usermode API to allow a system process running as Administrator to access all the same information. However, there is a big problem with that because the bad guys in general and APT actors in particular will write kernelmode rootkits that not only can trivially evade usermode detectionlogging, they can actively spoof systems calls and replace error codes see StuxNet for example. So instead of disabling the usermode EDR product which could be detected, they could hijack it and inject whatever they want via their kernel rootkit. So do shut up already with your droning claims of expertise already and go get a macbook, it will protect you from running thirdparty stuff in kernel mode by default. I think you need that. Already have one and I hate to break it to you but the vast majority of InfoSec peeps run nix. Either OsX or Linux. I have a windows gaming laptop, which is fine, but I dont use it for anything other than entertainment."

Their new ARR model enables customers to buy their tech on an OPEX basis vs CAPEX. That means more new wins more land and expand and at an accelerated pace. This stock price will only continue to go up and up. So if you short you just might lose in a big way. Shorting is a huge risk here. But go ahead if you believe you’re correct that they will lose market share vs grow market share. Good luck!"
