In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is. The value is added by gas centrifuging UF6. Only governments can do that."

Westinghouse stake, which is important imo if we want to play value investor and talk about EVEBITDA comparables etc. Nuclear trade all about vibesreflexivity and while this trade can certainly work, a confusing Brookfield family stonk seems like more of a heavy lift bc of complexity for less upside vs clean setup like LEU or just riding current winners after they cool off. That said, BEPC low IV option chain reduced potential downside volatility relative to other nuclear names up 100 on the month is attractive for risk management, for sure, but expectations should prob be moderated...Just gut reaction tho so heres to hoping trade works out"

The government hasnt exactly been spearheading the development of AI, I wouldnt be one bit surprised if the private sector figures out how to get the capacity needed quicker. Also AGI is probably more than two decades away, and it requires ingenuity and creativity just as much as it requires raw power, so megawatt count isnt deciding the winner.

That was V C Summer 23, another pair of AP1000s. Westinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt. Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK. Among nonauthoritarian countries in the last couple of decades, only South Korea has managed to build large nuclear reactors on a reasonable budget and schedule. Id be very wary of all the hype around nuclear, be it uranium, SMRs, or large reactors."

However, large reactors clock in 30 cheaper per unit of energy produced than SMRs. That is a huge difference. So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid i.e. majority of energy demand then large reactors are the way to go. The actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 57 data centers of 5 GW power each. That would take roughly 35 large power reactors. And they are just talking about what OpenAI wants. Microsoft just struck a deal to reopen a nuclear plant in NY as well."

The completion of Units 3 and 4 made Vogtle the largest clean energy generation site in the US as well as the largest energy generation site of any kind in the US. The cost of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not the correct anchor point for estimating additional AP1000s given costs that should not be incurred again. Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs. From page 4th. Notice they modeled the costs of future builds with the AP1000s and not any other design because they are keen on building AP1000s.

Looking at BEPCs Q2 results nuclearWestinghouse revenues are described to fall under the Distributed Energy Storage line item, which was 61 million out of 830 million total 2024 revenue at the time of the report. I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price. Edit 2 So Ive learned in this article on the Westinghouse fraud case that they were paid 600 million for construction work in 201617.. so if BEPC gets 51 of something in that ballpark for multiple units, yeah could be huge for the SP Id imagine... Im very interested. Someone come and poke holes in this please."

But the nuclear industry always claims that theyll learn their lessons and the next build will be smoother and on time and budget. And it never is. Basically every plant built in the 70s and 80s in the US had huge overruns, and many were cancelled after TMI. Even Watts Bar took much longer to complete than expected. Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different. This is unfortunately why the nuclear industry, which should be a perfect complement to solar and wind, and perfect for AI, is instead a sunset industry."

I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company.

Probably a good amount of mismanagement by Westinghouse and their construction contractors but also the costs of complying with regulatory scrutiny are high as well.

If you dont get a fill above 5.47, it would be better to exercise early. But exercising always carries an overnight risk.

Options are dumb in that the better you do, the less of the unrealized gains you are able to actually realize. Nobody wants to pay that premium for Options so deep itm that they dont feel has much more to go. If they are confident in the stock, they will just buy cheaper less itm or even otm options.

Whoever sold you those call options, thats whos shares youd be taking. Options are a zero sum game period, if you gain 100 shares someone else lost them. Secondly if your calls are in the money they will not expire worthless, period. The broker will either exercise for you and immediately make you sell the shares if you do not have the capital or in some cases they will sell the options for you. If this happens and volume is that low its very likely youll get a dog shit full price. Id try to sell them before that, you need to lower the price and see if any will sell. Bidask spreads are usually ridiculously wide on low volume options. Even though their may be good opportunities on low liquidity options sometimes, this is exactly why nobody trades them.

I bought 44 contracts for price of 0.63, so does that mean I have to minus off 0.63 x 44 x 100 2772 from all my calculations on exercising the options?"

Some mentioned that the broker can even do it for me i.e. buy and sell at exactly the same time, meaning I dont need any funds to do so... is that a possibility for some brokers? obviously I will have to call and confirm with them. Yes, thats a possibility with some brokers. In reality, they still do take on a risk doing that, because there are several hours between when settlement occurs and when market resumes trading. For options that expire on Fridays, the settlement actually happens on Saturday many hours after the market has closed and trading doesnt start for more than 24 hours later. The stock can open with a gap up or down when trading resumes. Thats the risk the broker is taking. The risk being that your account gets wiped out and the broker is left carrying the rest of the loss. Brokers with deep pockets can take those risks to offer smoother services to their clients."

Im ignoring the initial cash you paid for the contracts since thats fixed either way. Scenario 1 Exercise and sell the options. Purchase the shares for 17,600, and then sell for 41,668 which gives a profit of 24,068 Scenario 2 Sell the options contracts for 6. This gives a profit of 26,400. The equilibrium point where both scenarios yield the same return is when the following equation is equal. Strike Premium Current Stock Price, where S is your strike of 4, premium is the cost per contract you want to buysell at, and current stock price is self explanatory."

                    "text": "Im going to try to explain the jargon and answer this as clearly and thoroughly as I can. The answer to your first question is entirely dependent on which broker you are using and how your account is set up. The worst thing you can do here is nothing. You are right that open interest means that there are 1700ish open orders for that call contract. However, the bid or the highest price anyone is willing to pay looks like its about 20 cents below the ask or the lowest price anyone is willing to sell. If you want to close your position immediately and the bid price is acceptable to you, you can put your order through to sell all of the contracts at whatever the current bid price is and they will sellclose almost immediately at that price. You will not be maximizing your profits, but youll immediately end your position in this trade and make a nice profit. Since you are very new to this, this is the choice I would recommend. You are potentially leaving some additional profit on the table, but if youre happy with the profit so far, this strategy makes the most sense and immediately ends your risk of the underlying stock moving against you and the option price dropping. Your other choice is to exercise the contract and buy the shares. Even for calls that are deep in the money, this is pretty much never a good idea. You will need to have the cash in your account, or if you have a margin account, you will need to borrow the money from your broker and pay interest to buy the shares. You will be massively increasing your investment and your exposure to price movements. If you paid 500 for these contracts, the most you could lose is 500 if they expire worthless. If you buy the shares and the company goes bankrupt, you will have lost the total value of the shares you bought. Your last choice is to do nothing and see what your brokerage does. If youre even considering this, I would recommend closing your account after this trade and putting your money into a managed fund like a 401k or IRA. When you opened a brokerage account you decided to make decisions about your money. These are not managed accounts, we are the managers, we have to make these decisions. I dont know how anyone on here would recommend not putting an order in to your broker to do something. If you dont tell your broker what to do, they would be completely justified in letting your calls expire worthless and you will lose your entire investment. They may have a policy in place that they will try to close them for you at the best price they can get, but I wouldnt rely on that. You should look into something called theta decay when youre done with this, basically the options market understands that huge fluctuations in stock prices are rare. So as a contract nears its expiration date, its value decreases even if the underlying stocks price doesnt change. When youre buying puts and calls, your profit potential is based on the uncertainty of the price of the stock, and as you get closer to the expiration date, the stock price becomes more predictable and the value of the options decreases. You should consider this when deciding when it is best to close your positions. oh, and can you do a cashless exercise? maybe, thats up to you and your broker. Again, that would not be my choice. And can you exercise your options buy the shares and sell them the same day usually yes as long as you have not been flagged as a pattern day trader. I think if you make more than 4 day trades buying and selling an asset within one trading day in a 5 day period and your account has less than 25k in it, then your broker will flag you as a pattern day trader and youll need to wait a day to sell."

Id expect when the bull market really rallies up, likely starting in September miner stocks will skyrocket accordingly. Im hesitant to be long term though because halving actually hurts their margins, and their revenues are dependent on a volatile asset, plus energy costs and technical difficulties.

No legit brokerage would have let you buy a bankrupt penny stock sorry boomer. Nice story though. And yet ZERO additional distributions and I know because I bought at 0.3 and got nothing. In fact if you had listened you would have done a 6x from when I bought at 0.3 and advised to sell at 2+ aka 20+ in December, then buy CORZZ at 1 for a 10x into the 10 target year end. You don&#39;t mention this garbage listed at 6 then cratered to 3 the next day or that it went from 12 to 6 during the summer. The management lied about everything and got millions of shares for free."

Good thing the CEO got millions of shares for free since. The same pumpers on here claimed CORZ lists at 30-400 when it listed at 6 and cratered to 2.5.

If you bought in Jan &#39;23 during early stages of BR, you could have bought at $.042/sh (lows) with a lot of purchases at about $.06 - $.12/sh for that month. If you bought at .06/sh, you are at about 5,200% gain (yes, thousands percent gain in a year and half) when you include both warrants John lists below. No flipping or day trading, just purchase and hold. As icing on cake, there WILL be an additional distribution of .20 shares for every 10 pre-bankruptcy shares and .02 CORZW and .02 CORZZ warrants once the previously disallowed shareholder derivative suit gets thrown out (and it will get thrown out but our legal system is slow on appeals). This will further increase the gains. The new management of CORZ is pretty incredible on how they led the company through the BR process. Been doing this a long time and best I&#39;ve ever seen a company exit BR!"

It went down from 20 DECEMBER to 3 JANUARY, REMEMBER I CALLED IT EXACTLY. It went down from 12 to 6 REMEMBER this summer REMEMBER? PUMPERS IT DID NOT LIST at 30-300, IT LISTED at 6 then 3, now 13. ALL NEWS priced in. WRONG AGAIN. Like I said low 10s aka 13 is the top. Maybe 15 at 100k BTC. IREN will be 20-25 year end with far higher upside on the mining front 31 EHS at 20k or less cost, and more HPC AI potential. CORZ was a pump and dump going nowhere with terrible mining metrics and ZERO HPC AI Income this year. Enjoy the dilution. Remember CORZ was 150 in 2021 and 20+ last December. I told you it would list at 3 and then it went to 2.5! WHERE ARE THE ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS FROM MY 0.3 buy??"

Coreweave is in for $6.7B in Ai capacity and Coreweave is at a $19B valuation.  I wouldn’t be surprised if Coreweave makes an offer for CORZ above $15 per share.  The data centers require years to build so CORZ is out front with many large centers.  Additionally, bitcoin will continue to rise into 2025 and CORz will profit from the rise.  \n\nWe are getting good support at the higher Share price and soon we will see $14 and $15.  There is plenty of upside here and I like that our management has developed sound secondary revenue stream.  \n\nThis stock will continue on its healthy and normal run upward. It’s doing exactly what it should be doing and it will continue to rise after the election.  If Trump prevails, the rise will accelerate.  \n\nThe future is bright here.  Keep holding and enjoy the positive returns.  This is still a stock that could take off large based on analysts estimates all the way up to $20.  \n\nWishing everyone a good weekend and a great rise next week on this stock.  \n\nCheers."

When IREN gets an AI HPC contract it will pump as well, and either way IREN is lowest cost miner with the fastest expansion, not even close. You will see by December what a dog CORZ was as IREN and CLSK pump higher and higher. Enjoy the dilution and collapsing mining metrics. Maybe the CEO will get a few more million shares out of thin air to sell back to you clowns."

To me it is more clear than ever that the market sees Corz as a HPC/AI/Data center/hyper scaler company and not a bitcoin miner. This does not mean that bitcoin hitting new all time highs later this year won’t be a further bullish event for the price of corz. This stock is going to continue to move in 2024 on new announcements of core weave type deals with new clients and looking out further out into future the positive earnings reports in 2025/2026 and beyond that will be the result of those type of deals. If bitcoin were to hit $100k in next year and stay close to that for a good period of time and a new data center deal or two with a new client is announced in 2024/2025 I can easily see this stock at $30 a share with anything under $20 a share being unlikely if all goes to plan. Those additional distributions that us pre-emergence corz share holders are still hoping for are going to be extremely valuable at $20/$30 dollars a share. I personally had 50k shares before emergence deal with shareholders lowered my share count. By my math I could be do 1,000 shares of corz in additional distributions. That would be another gift from this CEO and this company that keeps on giving to us true longs. Any thoughts?"

They will ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share.Under her plan, the tax rate on long-term capital gains for those earning a million dollars a year or more will be 28 percent.Nowhere does it say anything about unrealized capital gains.They are proposing two tax cuts designed to help middle class and working Americans: the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects CORZ) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of CORZ to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

So, an CORZ investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects CORZ the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for CORZ. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

But why is it so important to you to constantly talk about what happened in December.  I dont really understand.  \n\nWhat relevance does the pre-bankruptcy status of this company have on the current state?   Different company, new CEO, new focus and new revenue streams.  \n\nI’m just trying to ascertain what your motivation is.  For the rest of the people on this board, there are cogent comments either why they own it or why they don’t.  Your comments are self aggrandizing and they are largely if not totally unrelated to the health of this company.  \n\nIn the end, the markets will support CORZ because the company makes sense. They are well managed and they will soon, in 2025, realize meaningful profits.  \n\nThis is still a buy at 11 or 12.  Good luck with your position."

So, an CORZ investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects CORZ the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for CORZ. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like CORZ to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax CORZ would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of CORZ stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on CORZ stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on CORZ stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."

The amount of institutional money in this stock is staggering.  Do you think those institutional investors have one up on Ken, with their Harvard and Wharton educated analysts?   I think so.  \n\nThis stock will do just fine. We will see a minimum 50% upside in 2024.  After the election.  Until then you have a rare opportunity to buy.  \n\nThe notion that Coreweave will go belly up, or why don’t we also throw in NVDA in another fantasy bankruptcy.  It’s not happening.  These companies are leading the AI field.  \n\nIn my opinion, a more likely scenario is Coreweave buys CORZ at $15.  \n\nIgnore these shorties.  They don’t know more than Vanguard and Blackrock.

Despite the contracts it’s still being evaluated as a Btc mining company. Gives me more time to buy up cheap shares incrementally. When it’s recognized as 1 of the top 20 data centers in the country its market cap should 10-20x to be on par with its peers, regardless of Btc prices. When Btc prices go where they historically have after a halving…it should be some sort of crazy exponential effect. Data centers and utility stocks could be the investor path forward. Utilities for the reliable dividends and supplying power to hpc companies and data centers for the growth. I view this stock as something in between since it can still bring in reliable revenue when Btc dips AND be a top 2 miner (more likely #1) when Btc goes crazy. Just a slightly biased opinion. If this ever started to shell out a reliable dividend I’d be a lifelong investor. If not, I’m waiting for $150-200/sh"

Cue John to tell you how this was already 15, 20, 25, 30, with shorts covering by August...100% dilution and losses for Q2. CEO getting air dropped shares while holders got no additional distributions. Scam then and scam now. They lied about everything from the exit date to when warrants attach. Never forget. Oh and they prevented the ERO participants from selling shares at the peak in December without explaining the tender and only unlocked shares after the colossal listing disaster AFTER all the insider buddies dumped everything on the market."

As the share price continues to rise these additional shares are getting to be more and more valuable assuming they do get distributed as promised.

I don&#39;t think much selling based on following price actions on Level II. I believe the institutions are doing their algorithm thing with their computer programs and buying and selling to/among themselves to buy as low as possible. Again, price action not indicative of any large sellers IMO. It will hit 12 shortly and go up to the 20/sh price targets pretty quickly IMO. If announcement of another (non-Coreweave) AI infrastructure contract, then 15-20 should easily come within a couple of months of such announcement, again IMO."

Per that article, it seems that the municipal power company are only too willing for such amendments as they will make more money because power supply for AI (which never turns off) will be greater for the city. The existence of these power agreements are the competitive advantage for CORZ as they have locked up both producers&#39; and transmitters&#39; existing supply - i.e., there is no more excess power for other AI infrastructure companies in the locale. IMO, CORZ is sitting on a gold mine with these contracts and, keep in mind, with the types of contracts that CORZ has in place with companies like Coreweave, they don&#39;t really care about the ultimate increase in power prices because this is a direct pass-through. In essence, CORZ is monetizing their existing power contracts for some serious cash - a great position to be in. Companies (e.g., MARA) that were asset light in their mining approach, has no chance in the AI business competitively because they don&#39;t have the power lock-ups that CORZ has. Good luck to us longs."

You should have bought CORZZ at 1 like me and CORZQ at 0.3 I dumped it at 11+ clowns. Where are the additional distributions so I can dump those too?"

He said majority of excess cash after repaying existing debt will be to invest in additional HPC and BTC mining sites and procuring power for those sites. Also, over 50% of CORZ&#39;s current fully diluted ownership is held by institutions. He also said based on what he is hearing, this percentage ownership by institutions should grow significantly based on interest. He stated and the institutions he has talked to anticipate CORZ will be a top-3 HPC infrastructure company upon execution of their 3 year strategy. Currently, as of new convert deal and resulting repayment of both 150MM bonds outstanding and certain bankruptcy exit debt, there are no more impediments for BTC HODL and any other finance decisions made by CORZ. Reiterated this all happened within 8 months of exit when they thought it would take 2 years! Great interview as always. Easy to find so view if current or interested in future CORZ investment. Good luck to us longs."

Thus, say CLSK mines a coin for $30 - 40k, they instantly receive that coin at nearly 100% profit if they are to sell it, which they don’t. They hold, hence when btc doubles (rises 100%) the recently mined coin poses a 200% gain. When bitcoin doubles again (rises to 200%), that recently mined coin poses a 400% gain. Therefore we can conclude that an increase in BTC should entail an even larger increase in CLSKs value and the sharper the increase in BTC the sharper the increase in CLSK. It’s an exponentially leveraged play. BTC just increased sharply, thus CLSK, CORZ, and other good miners even sharper. This explains why miners may increase despite bitcoin dropping in general. The MARAs play of buying bitcoins may have been suboptimal and better spent on equipment, however still may be a good one considering it’ll still make a substantial return."

Once this convertible offering completed and all the Traunche I CORZW warrants exercised, they will be sitting on about $850MM of cash after repaying this $218MM of total debt. Yesterday&#39;s announced upsized convert offering will be their only debt owed of any substance and this debt is long-term, low interest debt of $450MM that will ultimately be converted into equity. I have been assuming that they will buy BTC on market, like MARA announced, but not in yesterday&#39;s company release as was case with MARA. Would love some statement from Adam on how they plan to use the cash. He has previously said that CORZ will buy defaulted miner equipment purchases from other miner orders at discount but would figure $250MM at the most? Still leaves about 600MM per my calculations. IMO, something big is up. As a BTC bull, would love to see majority of cash used to buy BTC in the market at what I believe are deflated prices. We shall see - Adam has earned my trust at this point that he has something positive for stock price in mind."

CORZ says in press release that they essentially only have 212.5MM of total debt on balance sheet that will be fully paid with proceeds. If you look at their Q2 earnings slides, it seems that they received about another 100MM of T1 warrant exercises since 8/2/2024 since total debt went down about 100MM as those proceeds earmarked to repay debt. Bottom line is that institutions seem to really like CORZ&#39;s future prospects. Good job!"

It will have several positive outcomes for CORZ.  \n\nIt may be part of their bankruptcy proceedings management.  As part of the bankruptcy, they are obligated to sell all BTC immediately. Perhaps the new notes will finally satisfy the court and they will be able to hold BTC in advance of the inevitable rise in price. \n\nThe management team here is the smartest in the business.  I believe they are looking at long term.  The new low interest capital will allow infrastructure investing in more facilities with more equipment.  Perhaps this is in their plan.  \n\nAnd ultimately, they are receiving money from big institutions which indicates a long term bullish sentiment.  I am going to be buying this stock at the current discounted price today, as I bought last week below $8. That’s my personal view.  I remain positive in my outlook."

It shows that total debt outstanding as of that date is 318MM. As of that date, only 54K of Traunche I warrants were exercised into CORZ stock (total of $400K came into balance sheet). 35MM of total 82MM Traunche II warrants were exercised into CORZ stock so 47MM CORZZ warrants still out as warrants. Says $670MM of additional proceeds from Traunche I warrants still out to come into CORZ as cash when exercised. Bottom line is that today&#39;s $400MM in convertibles + $670MM Traunche I warrant proceeds will result in 1.07B of cash into CORZ. Of this total only $318MM of total debt to repay so about $700MM of cash will be on hand with no earmarked need. Has to be to purchase BTC in open market for HODL IMO (note, I believe HPC infrastructure development costs completely funded by counterparty). CORZ&#39;s balance sheet is/will be looking pretty good 8 months out of Chapter 11."

See Page 22 of Emergence slides for detail of this loan. This leaves $250MM proceeds for &#34;general operations&#34; per press release. I had previously thought that the CORW warrant exercises would be used to repay this loan. However, if you take this issuance in conjunction with MARA&#39;s recent issue, there seems to be a purpose IMO. These miners, who know best about the production of new BTC, seem to be of the view that BTC will rise quickly and sharply IMO. The secured notes that CORZ will repay are the last bump that precluded CORZ from HODL strategy on BTC. We shall see, but I believe that, like MARA, CORZ will use a lot of remaining proceeds and warrant exercise proceeds to buy BTC in market just like MARA announced. I am a BTC bull and a long-term holder of CORZ so if this is the case, I love the strategy. We shall see though. Good luck to us longs."

With the current ratio of 50% of a coin going to the electricity company it makes is impossible to reach just $1 Billion in revenue let alone the $15 Billion they have already contracted, especially with the future halving&#39;s coming up and  even with future price increase in BTC.  AI hosting is the revenue and the company  with margins that are consistent and large.  Once the major market makers are finished with keeping the stock low hoping the average retail investor gets board or gives up,  they will allow the stock to rise and when it does, it will be a run like nobody has seen before."
