Reddit,2024-10-22,"I was a scientist in the nuclear industry in the 80s and 90s, its going to be a decade before I retire. Ive worked on reactors, reprocessing and warhead production. In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is. The value is added by gas centrifuging UF6. Only governments can do that.",Neutral,0,0.9990798234939575,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"The DD is indeed bending reality. In addition to Vogtle 34, there was another project that survived the postFukushima wipeout of US new nuclear builds. That was V C Summer 23, another pair of AP1000s. Westinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt. Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK. Among nonauthoritarian countries in the last couple of decades, only South Korea has managed to build large nuclear reactors on a reasonable budget and schedule.

Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs. From page 4th. Notice they modeled the costs of future builds with the AP1000s and not any other design because they are keen on building AP1000s.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Thanks for posting this DD. Looking at BEPCs Q2 results nuclearWestinghouse revenues are described to fall under the Distributed Energy Storage line item, which was 61 million out of 830 million total 2024 revenue at the time of the report. I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price. Edit 2 So Ive learned in this article on the Westinghouse fraud case that they were paid 600 million for construction work in 201617.. so if BEPC gets 51 of something in that ballpark for multiple units, yeah could be huge for the SP Id imagine... Im very interested. Someone come and poke holes in this please.",Neutral,0,0.9669090509414673,Reply

But the nuclear industry always claims that theyll learn their lessons and the next build will be smoother and on time and budget. And it never is. Basically every plant built in the 70s and 80s in the US had huge overruns, and many were cancelled after TMI. Even Watts Bar took much longer to complete than expected. Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different.

I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company.

And, if it really is that I want to exercise before expiry, am I allowed to borrow margin for that purpose, or someone mentioned it can be a cashless exercise where the broker will not even need my money if its the same day? I think I should have enough allowable margin to buy it although I would want to sell it relatively soon after anyway I think, or maybe on the same day if they allow?",Neutral,0,0.9996064305305481,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-13,"Im going to try to explain the jargon and answer this as clearly and thoroughly as I can. The answer to your first question is entirely dependent on which broker you are using and how your account is set up. The worst thing you can do here is nothing. You are right that open interest means that there are 1700ish open orders for that call contract. However, the bid or the highest price anyone is willing to pay looks like its about 20 cents below the ask or the lowest price anyone is willing to sell. If you want to close your position immediately and the bid price is acceptable to you, you can put your order through to sell all of the contracts at whatever the current bid price is and they will sellclose almost immediately at that price. You will not be maximizing your profits, but youll immediately end your position in this trade and make a nice profit. Since you are very new to this, this is the choice I would recommend. You are potentially leaving some additional profit on the table, but if youre happy with the profit so far, this strategy makes the most sense and immediately ends your risk of the underlying stock moving against you and the option price dropping. Your other choice is to exercise the contract and buy the shares. Even for calls that are deep in the money, this is pretty much never a good idea. You will need to have the cash in your account, or if you have a margin account, you will need to borrow the money from your broker and pay interest to buy the shares. You will be massively increasing your investment and your exposure to price movements. If you paid 500 for these contracts, the most you could lose is 500 if they expire worthless. If you buy the shares and the company goes bankrupt, you will have lost the total value of the shares you bought. Your last choice is to do nothing and see what your brokerage does. If youre even considering this, I would recommend closing your account after this trade and putting your money into a managed fund like a 401k or IRA. When you opened a brokerage account you decided to make decisions about your money. These are not managed accounts, we are the managers, we have to make these decisions. I dont know how anyone on here would recommend not putting an order in to your broker to do something. If you dont tell your broker what to do, they would be completely justified in letting your calls expire worthless and you will lose your entire investment. They may have a policy in place that they will try to close them for you at the best price they can get, but I wouldnt rely on that. You should look into something called theta decay when youre done with this, basically the options market understands that huge fluctuations in stock prices are rare. So as a contract nears its expiration date, its value decreases even if the underlying stocks price doesnt change. When youre buying puts and calls, your profit potential is based on the uncertainty of the price of the stock, and as you get closer to the expiration date, the stock price becomes more predictable and the value of the options decreases. You should consider this when deciding when it is best to close your positions. oh, and can you do a cashless exercise? maybe, thats up to you and your broker. Again, that would not be my choice. And can you exercise your options buy the shares and sell them the same day usually yes as long as you have not been flagged as a pattern day trader. I think if you make more than 4 day trades buying and selling an asset within one trading day in a 5 day period and your account has less than 25k in it, then your broker will flag you as a pattern day trader and youll need to wait a day to sell.",Neutral,0,0.9998171329498291,Reply

Yahoo,2024-10-29,"Per John&#39;s posting below, I&#39;ll give you the percentage gains. If you bought in Jan &#39;23 during early stages of BR, you could have bought at $.042/sh (lows) with a lot of purchases at about $.06 - $.12/sh for that month. If you bought at .06/sh, you are at about 5,200% gain (yes, thousands percent gain in a year and half) when you include both warrants John lists below. No flipping or day trading, just purchase and hold.

Yahoo,2024-10-19,"Corz is on solid ground.  Still mining and also selling capacity for AI. This is called sound business strategy.  Coreweave is in for $6.7B in Ai capacity and Coreweave is at a $19B valuation.  I wouldn’t be surprised if Coreweave makes an offer for CORZ above $15 per share.  The data centers require years to build so CORZ is out front with many large centers.  Additionally, bitcoin will continue to rise into 2025 and CORz will profit from the rise.  

We are getting good support at the higher Share price and soon we will see $14 and $15.  There is plenty of upside here and I like that our management has developed sound secondary revenue stream.  

This stock will continue on its healthy and normal run upward. It’s doing exactly what it should be doing and it will continue to rise after the election.  If Trump prevails, the rise will accelerate.  

The future is bright here.  Keep holding and enjoy the positive returns.  This is still a stock that could take off large based on analysts estimates all the way up to $20.

Yahoo,2024-09-26,"Bitcoin hits $65k and Corz is down today when almost all other miners are up and some are up big on this positive bitcoin movement. To me it is more clear than ever that the market sees Corz as a HPC/AI/Data center/hyper scaler company and not a bitcoin miner. This does not mean that bitcoin hitting new all time highs later this year won’t be a further bullish event for the price of corz. This stock is going to continue to move in 2024 on new announcements of core weave type deals with new clients and looking out further out into future the positive earnings reports in 2025/2026 and beyond that will be the result of those type of deals. If bitcoin were to hit $100k in next year and stay close to that for a good period of time and a new data center deal or two with a new client is announced in 2024/2025 I can easily see this stock at $30 a share with anything under $20 a share being unlikely if all goes to plan. Those additional distributions that us pre-emergence corz share holders are still hoping for are going to be extremely valuable at $20/$30 dollars a share. I personally had 50k shares before emergence deal with shareholders lowered my share count. By my math I could be do 1,000 shares of corz in additional distributions.

Yahoo,2024-09-17,"Here is where we stand with tax policy:Kamala Harris and Biden together stated last winter that they would liketo tax long-term capital gains as &#34;ordinary income&#34;. So, an CORZ investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects CORZ the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for CORZ. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her.

Yahoo,2024-09-07,"Here is a rundown of policy differences. This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like CORZ to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax CORZ would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of CORZ stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on CORZ stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on CORZ stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal.",Neutral,0,0.9883650541305542,Main

When it’s recognized as 1 of the top 20 data centers in the country its market cap should 10-20x to be on par with its peers, regardless of Btc prices. When Btc prices go where they historically have after a halving…it should be some sort of crazy exponential effect. Data centers and utility stocks could be the investor path forward. Utilities for the reliable dividends and supplying power to hpc companies and data centers for the growth. I view this stock as something in between since it can still bring in reliable revenue when Btc dips AND be a top 2 miner (more likely #1) when Btc goes crazy. Just a slightly biased opinion.

Yahoo,2024-08-27,"Worth reading is the Aug. 20th North Texas Daily article about CORZ&#39;s Denton facility power contract amendment to allow for AI hosting from original mining only operations. Per that article, it seems that the municipal power company are only too willing for such amendments as they will make more money because power supply for AI (which never turns off) will be greater for the city. The existence of these power agreements are the competitive advantage for CORZ as they have locked up both producers&#39; and transmitters&#39; existing supply - i.e., there is no more excess power for other AI infrastructure companies in the locale. IMO, CORZ is sitting on a gold mine with these contracts and, keep in mind, with the types of contracts that CORZ has in place with companies like Coreweave, they don&#39;t really care about the ultimate increase in power prices because this is a direct pass-through. In essence, CORZ is monetizing their existing power contracts for some serious cash - a great position to be in. Companies (e.g., MARA) that were asset light in their mining approach, has no chance in the AI business competitively because they don&#39;t have the power lock-ups that CORZ has.

Yahoo,2024-08-14,"Very nice pricing on the convertible debt offering! Upsized to $460MM ($400 initial +$60 oversubscribed allocations - it is going to be the full 460 IMO). Based on upsizing from yesterday&#39;s initial 350MM amount means a lot of institutional demand for CORZ convertibles (shows institutions bullish on future CORZ stock price above $11 convert price embedded in convert price - 30% premium vs closing price). 3% cash interest rate (by comparison, the $150MM notes being repaid had 12.5% rate). CORZ says in press release that they essentially only have 212.5MM of total debt on balance sheet that will be fully paid with proceeds. If you look at their Q2 earnings slides, it seems that they received about another 100MM of T1 warrant exercises since 8/2/2024 since total debt went down about 100MM as those proceeds earmarked to repay debt. Bottom line is that institutions seem to really like CORZ&#39;s future prospects. Good job!",Positive,1,0.9813397526741028,Main
Yahoo,2024-08-14,"I believe people are misunderstanding this situation.  The new convertible notes are replacing old notes which are 4X higher in interest.  It will have several positive outcomes for CORZ.  

It may be part of their bankruptcy proceedings management.  As part of the bankruptcy, they are obligated to sell all BTC immediately. Perhaps the new notes will finally satisfy the court and they will be able to hold BTC in advance of the inevitable rise in price. 

The management team here is the smartest in the business.  I believe they are looking at long term.  The new low interest capital will allow infrastructure investing in more facilities with more equipment.  Perhaps this is in their plan.  

And ultimately, they are receiving money from big institutions which indicates a long term bullish sentiment.  I am going to be buying this stock at the current discounted price today, as I bought last week below $8. That’s my personal view.  I remain positive in my outlook.",Positive,1,1.0,Main

It shows that total debt outstanding as of that date is 318MM. As of that date, only 54K of Traunche I warrants were exercised into CORZ stock (total of $400K came into balance sheet). 35MM of total 82MM Traunche II warrants were exercised into CORZ stock so 47MM CORZZ warrants still out as warrants. Says $670MM of additional proceeds from Traunche I warrants still out to come into CORZ as cash when exercised. Bottom line is that today&#39;s $400MM in convertibles + $670MM Traunche I warrant proceeds will result in 1.07B of cash into CORZ. Of this total only $318MM of total debt to repay so about $700MM of cash will be on hand with no earmarked need.

Yahoo,2024-08-13,"350MM convertible note issue with potential for 52.5MM over-subscribers issuance (which I assume will be exercised) for total 400MM convert deal. I see what they are doing. They said in release that they will pay off the 150MM new secured (non-convert) loan that had a 12.5% cash interest rate. See Page 22 of Emergence slides for detail of this loan. This leaves $250MM proceeds for &#34;general operations&#34; per press release. I had previously thought that the CORW warrant exercises would be used to repay this loan. However, if you take this issuance in conjunction with MARA&#39;s recent issue, there seems to be a purpose IMO. These miners, who know best about the production of new BTC, seem to be of the view that BTC will rise quickly and sharply IMO. The secured notes that CORZ will repay are the last bump that precluded CORZ from HODL strategy on BTC. We shall see, but I believe that, like MARA, CORZ will use a lot of remaining proceeds and warrant exercise proceeds to buy BTC in market just like MARA announced.
