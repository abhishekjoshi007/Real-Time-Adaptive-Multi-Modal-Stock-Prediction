Reddit,2024-08-15,"I dont like Starbucks, never really have. But its an interesting thought exercise If you were given 85 million signing bonus plus an even sicker compensation package, what changes would you make to prove you were worth it? Myself, my forte is in making services and products undeniably great, and letting quality drive the business side. Not to the exclusion of shrewd business strategy and tactics, but I just put the priority on having something great that people want, and letting that be the flywheel. So for me, Id finally accept the incredibly common perception that Starbucks actual coffee is mediorceburnt. Weve seen others publicly and with humility accept and fix that... see McCafe, DPZ, CMG, etc. For those who say you cant make that change! I say you cant expect big changes unless you make changes. For those who say the old is good enough, I point to the stock performance as proof its not. Id be the best quality and go with a nicer but more broadly appealing taste profile. As SBUX, wed have the scale and resources to get the very best while still benefitting from scale. Im not sweating about margins in the first wave of this transformation because frankly a drink that you can charge a food price for suggests margin not be a problem over time. Second Id embrace some tech. People are kind of over the myth that you need a slow paced barista teasing out your drink for five minutes. CafeLux and Nespresso have shown you can get 90 of great coffee or cold drinks without lifting a finger. Id seek to take the best of learnings from those and apply them to a faster service model. Maybe that means the barista role is to focus on the part only they can do, and do best, but spares them from the other 90. Thats still TBD, but the goal of pumping out the actual drinks, cold or hot, WAY faster is not negotiable. In parallel wed have some kind of highly mediamentionable value choices. Perhaps not the 99 cent coffee that every pundit thinks they were the first to think of, since it would only be reinforcing the oldbad taste and also trading short term traffic surge which isnt the problem for weaker reputation and perception. But maybe some quick and easy 3 buck options that are enough to generate broad public knowledge. The taste and speed have to be newsworthy upgrades. The value options must also generate a buzz, but should be aligned with supporting not undermining the first two priorities. There would be more phases, but the emergency mission would be whole new supply and taste, combined with huge efficiency boost by automating that which can be. That phase alone probably justifies yesterdays 20 billion move.",Positive,2,0.7761634588241577,Reply

This guy better do a real good job with how much they are handing over. Do you know what I mean? Its a big job sure but this mentality of thinking just this guy can do the job looks stupid to me. Maybe Im wrong, I guess the important thing to them is that they spend the money on the guy they think has the best odds of accomplishing their goals.

Because there are often measurable differences in companies decisions and the value therein between CEOs when the rest of the company makeup remains largely the same. The easiest examples of this would be Jamie Dimon and Steve Jobs, both of whom pretty easily can be shown to have had billions of dollars of impact on shareholders vs. their peers. Major differences in performance of companies is indicative of deeper issues throughout the company, not of the decisions of a single person How do you think those issues get resolved? Who decides how to resolve them? I also think youd find plenty of leaders within these companies who are more than capable of doing the job without needing 20M bonuses Im sure I can find someone to do your job for less than you currently do it for, however much that is. What someone needs isnt relevant. What someones value is, as determined by the rarity of their skillset, is. If the company viewed the other leaders within the company as equally competent to lead the company as the CEO, but cheaper, they wouldve simply hired those leaders instead. But the difference between a good CEO and one 1 worse than that good CEO is hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars for very large companies. Duke Energy literally pays McKinsey to completely control restructuring of their entire company. No. Theyre paying McKinsey to execute a restructuring for them. Thats not outsourcing decisionmaking to McKinsey the company made the decision to restructure, and they hired experts people who had, ya know, done this sort of thing before to come in and tell them the best way to do it. Who do you think would be a better fit to do that job internally? theyve got a CEO getting 20M bonuses while they lay people off and restructure the entire company every year. ... Every year?

My wife is a lawyer and has personally settled cases that their company expected to win because settling was the cheaper option. 2. The lawsuit had to do with defects with the car, and the central point had little to do with Teslas or Musks claims about autonomous driving. As for Thunderf00t I think just being a YouTuber doesnt automatically discredit you. It doesnt mean hes wrong, it just means that Im not going to go watch his video on the offchance he might be right. He doesnt have any credentials to make his videos worth watching to me why would I consider him trustworthy? And Thunderf00t happens to be a reputable researcher in chemistry Why do you think that makes him an expert on EVs or Tesla? Theranos. 11 years 3 months prison for CEO Theranos and Holmes being guilty of fraud doesnt make TeslaMusk guilty of fraud. In fact, the fact that she was prosecuted for fraud suggests that our legal system does, in fact, chase these allegations. So why did Holmes and Theranos get prosecuted, and Musk doesnt, when Musk is easily more notable and publicfacing? 2016 article Elon Musk says fully selfdriving Tesla cars already being built No, thats the clickbait headline. The article actually says that he said All new Tesla models are being built with hardware to enable them to be fully selfdriving, Elon Musk has announced. Having the hardware to be selfdriving doesnt mean that the car is currently capable of selfdriving. The German government has called on Elon Musks company to stop using the Autopilot branding Ok? That doesnt mean hes committed fraud lol. As Elon Musk promises full selfdriving, experts worry Tesla is using consumers as guinea pigs Nothing in this article suggests that Musk has made fraudulent claims. alleging that the Autopilot system in Tesla cars How is this linked to Musk making fraudulent claims? sued after they were later presented with price hikes and delays How is this criminal fraud? They sued for damages and won them because Tesla didnt live up to its contract, but thats not fraud, and its especially not fraud from Musk something his company doesnt deliver on is not personal liability for a criminal offense. This one is unresolved and I trust musk will be condemned This is maybe the only one that would prove your point... but its unresolved, and its odd that you think hes going to lose, given that hes been sued for false claims in the past and the case was dismissed. And there are so many more including child labor, racism, labor rights..... This sentence represents the issue with your entire comment.

I&#39;ve seen numerous scenarios run for either candidate winning, and you get wins either way. Either Pete B. as Transportation Secretary may gain even more influence (and already has the back of Ouster), or you get so much anti-China trade sentiment that anyone operating autonomous platforms or even simply ADAS, or even a tractor/combine near a US Military base - none of those will be allowed to have a Chinese-Hesai sensor that can map out the environment.

If you wanted to be even more conservative in your Fair Value analysis, you could use TTM P/S 5 that puts a more conservative mark at $10.30 but that is still above the current OUST trading range.",Neutral,0,0.9999877214431763,Main

(not exactly sure what this means other than processing fpga/uP/etc..)The information that I can find on the DF sensor basically is the same as above, but significantly includes two other items:5) Global Shutter.6) Digital Flash.I do not have experience with Lidar, but I do know something about camera design and RTL logic design in FPGA&#39;s.  Global shutter (as opposed to a rolling shutter) means all the pixels are exposed to the image (the light) at the same time.  This is why they don&#39;t have motion artifacts and yes, it&#39;s a big deal.  Digital Flash would burst broadcast VCSEL laser emitters simultaneously, which you can see would work well with a Global shutter.  So I have two basic questions and I&#39;m not even sure if anyone will know, but please shout out if you do.1) All of the OS series device datasheets have a specification for &#34;Rotation Rate&#34; in the range of 10 or 20 Hz.    What is this talking about?  2) Are the differences between the OS and DF series of devices summed up in the Global Shutter and Digital Flash capabilities or am I missing an important item?Lastly, question #2 is not meant to say &#34;That&#39;s not enough&#34;..  actually that&#39;s a huge deal, but I am still curious for the answer.thanks,david",Neutral,0,0.9998482465744019,Main

It&#39;s Lose-Lose for the USA, because there is proof that Huawei obtained US Tech under the table from TSMC, as the precise match in spec&#39;s could not have been arrived at any other way (China did not have the means to get there before the tech transfer). While you can see many stories being spun by TSMC because it doesn&#39;t want this incident to affect their company, they&#39;re lying through their teeth. Taiwan has over 1M people commuting to mainland China now - monthly/weekly/daily even, depending on income level and the status of the job. The Chinese have successfully intermarried with Taiwanese and you&#39;ll see Taiwan &#34;won&#34; without a shot fired, or even if it is a military seizure - it will be much less than expected because the people are shifting pro-China and compromised as they fade from traditional Taiwanese independence in their values. Why this matters for Ouster - they cannot trust outsourcing to Taiwan for any patented/proprietary production at this point, for subcomponents.

Most of us know - Ouster&#39;s debt was paid off in August, but after Q2 closed, so it did not hit the books yet, and - it&#39;s not on any brokerage house&#39;s data set for OUST, and if you click &#34;Statistics&#34; here in Yahoo Finance, you&#39;ll see the old balance of Debt.Just consider - any 3rd party, individual investor/trader at Retail level, or the highest-tier Analyst at a big institution - OUST will look totally different as an investment after this upcoming 10-Q is released. Debt position will be cleaned up. Cash remaining after paying off Debt will be resolved, but the reduction in costs of the $1M Debt payments will be gone, further showing Ouster&#39;s effectiveness at Cost Controls as they approach the runway for Profitability.This is just to say that - even the random stock pickers out there, are more likely to pick OUST as a Buy at this point, and not just because of TTM P/S Ratio valuation analysis as I tend to gravitate toward - the many other stats are getting cleaned up this quarter, along with yet another improvement in Year-over-Year Revenue Growth.

They made the excuse that an expected sale in the quarter was not booked. Maybe they thought it sounded like a good excuse when Ouster used it last quarter. Regardless, MVIS was justifiably sold off today, because their early release of earnings tried to announce a move into Industrial sales of LiDAR, and that they had talked to Auto OEMs and had participated in several RFP/RFQs (they basically said - MVIS deserves a Participation Trophy).

The takeaway is that the 3.1 firmware has the capacity to separate very nearfield masses from others.  This in turn gives them the ability to filter out obstructions on the glass of the sensor.  I expect there is some pretty decent math going on behind this in that they still have the full image, without the artifacts of the obstructions on the glass.  The demo is a live image as the camera is being sprayed with a water bottle.  The new firmware image does not seem to change at all.

Yahoo,2024-10-14,"Both Robosense and Hesai have been getting pounded as they sell off. There was a change in the Chinese Stimulus program, as the EV and related industries abroad may get cut off, due to ongoing policy changes already happening now, and expected to worsen for China&#39;s trade if Donald Trump is elected. Chinese Automotive Industry related companies inside the USA may be forced to shut down, and the many ventures in Mexico and Canada now appear to be at risk also, as they were attempts to skirt tariffs. The surprise move has been the manufacturing Unions in the USA, now shifting toward GOP support instead of longstanding Democrat alignment that was assumed to be permanent. Things change when factories close in our country, and even worse when foreign companies show up down the road from the closed plant, or just across the border in Mexico, to do the same job. Will this be the end of Hesai in the USA? Likely, it will be Bye, Bye, Hesai if Trump is elected. There is already Bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to continue to push against Chinese Robotaxi sales and operations inside the USA, LiDAR sales/operations as well, and that list could grow.

Today&#39;s news reemphasized other issues with Tesla that I haven&#39;t voiced much here, but you should consider the growing list:GEICO denied/cancelled policies for Tesla Cybertruck, as the liability/risks are too lengthy and more being added as inspections and wear reveal significant design flaws.Cybertruck design added aluminum components in areas where Vertical Loads are significant for towing trailers, which means a Cybertruck could rip itself apart if it has a max Gross Weight trailer load, and now the 3rd party engineers looking at this flaw are saying that Cybertruck may need to be reduced to very light trailers that only put around 100 pounds on the tongue. No doubt - Cybertruck&#39;s electric motors have plenty of torque to pull heavy loads, but those heavy loads still put weight vertically on the tongue and hitch, which means Tesla engineers obviously haven&#39;t worked with trailers and truck suspensions much at all in their careers.Tesla Optical sensors degrade over time, with clouding much like headlamp covers, leading to degradation of photons passively received.

Free cash flow was -22m last quarter despite debt increasing quarter-over-quarter. An important point here being that debt was not a factor in the company operating well below breakeven last quarter.

Assuming the debt payment hits paper this quarter we are looking at a potential crisis as beaten down longs. Quite simply, if revenue remains relatively flat quarter-over-quarter cash flow will be beyond bad.

Revenue is projected at 27-29m after coming in at 26.9m last quarter. So it’s really not looking great….

Yahoo,2024-09-27,"On the debate about ATM sales of stock and being mindful of shareholders, there is a somewhat compromise that the company could pursue, and should do so at their earliest opportunity to express their plans for longer term management of the Outstanding Shares and Implied Shares. Ouster could publicly state that once profitable, they will start to use a portion of cash gained, to buy back shares that they&#39;ve had to sell ATM. In fact - go as far as to say 1-for-1, all ATM sold shares will be bought back once profitable, over the first 3 years that OUST is a profitable company. That - would help give some assurances to current shareholders that the management is not being flippant with ATM shares sold.As many of you know - I had a divergent view in Spring 2023, that OUST should have bought &#34;up to 5 million&#34; shares which would have only cost $20-25M back then (stock was in $4-5 range when I first brought this up). Oh, the raging responses of &#34;Cash is King&#34; etc. Well, as I argued - &#34;Takes Money to make Money&#34; overrides your theory, as does valuation data and OUST price went into oversold &gt;80RSI status in the $14-16 range. Ouster could have doubled their money, at minimum, if OUST buy-back shares at $5 sold at $10, and netted $25M at minimum, would have gained at least half the amount necessary to pay off debt and if sold at a higher amount, such as their ATM sales at $12-14 range, the entire debt could have been paid.

It&#39;s Elon&#39;s hope that he can manage to keep paying very little for cheap optical sensors so he doesn&#39;t have to commit the money for more expensive electro-optical sensors. Another flaw is that optical sensors degrade over time with clouding of lenses and/or covers much like headlight covers, whereas active laser pings still get through even when LiDAR covers get old. Elon Musk isn&#39;t always right, and he&#39;s especially wrong to try and leap into full autonomy with Tesla Robotaxi, unless he gives in and commits to a LiDAR multi-sensor array.",Neutral,0,0.5366465449333191,Main

Would be good to review how much control that CEO Angus Pacala and his executive staff hold at this point, in % terms, since many ATM sales later, the stock has been diluted and the ATM sales have been at a greater pace/volume than Angus and the exec&#39;s have bought shares.

Probably a good question at the next Earnings Call.While Austin Russell holds 70% control via LAZR B-shares, it&#39;s not as clear cut as to who holds sway over Ouster at the moment, and this sell-off does present opportunities for Ouster to lose control and be bought out - at a less favorable price, which is another angle that could be played here, by the nefarious actors that rummage the board.

What many outside California don&#39;t realize, is that Silicon Valley pays a lot of money to lobby State Govt and the Governor to elevate wages, because a costly human is the best incentive to buy robots instead.If you want proof, search for this headline:Chipotle Starts Replacing Workers With Robots to Bypass California’s Minimum Wage LawsThere are at least a dozen articles out for this specific issue, and many other companies are going the same route. In the past, at lower Minimum Wage Levels, the cost of buying robots to work in fast food was prohibitive, but not now. Just be aware that Silicon Valley lobbies your own State Governments also (and Governors) to raise Minimum Wage across the entire USA (and this effort is going global).One could argue it&#39;s a Chicken vs Egg debate, but in Silicon Valley, the Golden Goose comes from government, to essentially push out low-wage workers while their tech companies get enriched with automation investments and purchases. I&#39;m a huge supporter of what Ouster is doing for Autonomy, but this is one area where California has laid a rotten egg.",Neutral,0,0.9887531995773315,Main
Yahoo,2024-09-23,"Hey Puck, instead of hiding behind all your Alternate/Alias Accounts, howabout you actually tell us here how and why you think Hesai will outclass other LiDAR companies, including Ouster.

I will even &#34;Sign Out&#34; to come back in and read your post (that&#39;s the technique to still seeing Muted accounts in Yahoo btw).My questions for you would be:How do you verify and have certainty that the Chinese production numbers for Hesai are even accurate, considering they are not audited?What was the real reason that the infamous former Hesai CFO resigned from his position?Even if Hesai continues to manufacture LiDAR Sensors in China, for Chinese-produced vehicles, how does Hesai overcome the low-margins sales to Chinese Auto OEMs?Why would HSAI actually be a good investment, even if one were pro-China as a Chinese Citizen? How does Hesai&#39;s past performance in low-margin Auto component sales add up to any future success, considering their market is getting limited and margins are shrinking?Why would the US Government not take action against Hesai at this point? How is Hesai innocent?Do you really believe that Hesai is guiltless from IP Theft and Patent Infringement for Ouster Technology? Hesai already pays for past violations to Velodyne, but do you think Hesai was innocent in that case also?If HSAI is removed/delisted from US Stock Market listing, will you still hold the stock?",Neutral,0,0.9976750016212463,Main

Inflow over the last 12 months was 37 Institutional Buyers amounting to $34.2M of stock, with Outflows of only 9 Institutions at $1.76M of stock. If you factor this in vs outflow as a ratio, OUST is among the best stocks for Institutional inflow over the outflow. Interestingly, some of the more recent Institutions buying OUST include Pension plans, who invest for long term.Ouster paid off all their debt in August of this year, and is one of only two LiDAR companies among the dozen that I track, that are debt-free.Book Value per Share sat at 3.62 before the debt payoff.Short Sales stock count was 6M and could have gone to 7M. While this may not seem like a &#34;Value&#34; statistic, those Short-Sellers will eventually cover, amounting to upward pressure on the stock just like any other Buy.

Yahoo,2024-09-20,"How is Ouster different than their peers? Ouster pursued all the Verticals or sectors outside of the Auto Industry primarily, in ramping up sensor development and with their R&amp;D focus over the years. Ouster applied most resources toward what is now the OS Family of Sensors - not Auto OEM grade/sized, but more of a universal option to put LiDAR on as many different platforms as possible. The OS Family is in the Auto Industry, as post-OEM mods such as panel vans, buses, and semi-trucks.The OS Family opened up a wider variety of Use Cases for customers to develop next-gen solutions, and is why Ouster now has hundreds of customers that have experimented with the OS Family.Amazon uses this same approach, and helps explain why Ouster gets great Margins for their sales (up in the 40% Gross Margin range), because Amazon uses Proteus robots in the warehouse to offset personnel costs. In any business, normally the largest cost driver are the personnel costs. This affects the Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS, an acronym to remember). Amazon will gladly pay a premium for an Ouster sensor, to reduce personnel costs. Whereas a fickle Retail Consumer shopping for an Automobile, may not want to use their limited funds to buy an expensive LiDAR add-on option. In addition, the Auto Industry itself is fickle as to what vendors they buy car parts from (just check how your car stereo speakers change year after year, as one example).Ouster is succeeding because it helps lower COGS in multiple industries.",Neutral,0,0.9544312357902527,Main

I&#39;d like to see INDI and OUST form a partnership where OUST makes the sensors that INDI puts into their going systems. What INDI primarily develops and manufactures - dashboard electronics to include many modern car dashes that have Google Autoplay and Apple&#39;s auto systems as well. You&#39;ve probably used INDI products before, and didn&#39;t know it (their brand doesn&#39;t appear on the &#34;stereo&#34; on the dash), especially if you&#39;ve rented a newer vehicle.  INDI hit their 52-week low recently, and I was waiting for signs of a reversal and I&#39;m not certain it has reversed yet but anything below $4 should be a &#34;safe&#34; Entry Point for INDI. Not advertising for the stock, just making sure Ouster investors put INDI on your radar because what they&#39;re doing has high potential to look for outsourcing of the LiDAR sensors as Ouster comes to market with the new upgraded DF Sensor. If INDI were to shut down in-house development of LiDAR, to favor outsourcing, it&#39;s a big deal as to who they would buy LiDAR from (they&#39;re already embedded with Auto OEMs btw).",Neutral,0,0.9999059438705444,Main

Ouster&#39;s Gemini software also gets packaged into the deal.Why ITK Engineering in itself is the gold nugget - it&#39;s a fully-owned subsidiary of Bosch. Why that matters - Bosch made a conscious decision a year ago, to discontinue in-house development of LiDAR sensors. Remember that news? At the time, it was hinted at that Ouster could get Bosch&#39;s business for Auto OEM sales, but that&#39;s a follow-on discussion at this point. The bigger story is that ITK Engineering is a major artery for sales into European industry, in many forms, and that means Ouster has a going relationship with a major Component manufacturer that has chosen their product AND software for ongoing development.Don&#39;t underwhelm this news, when you put 1+1 together - what are the implications for Bosch developing Auto OEM components, once Ouster&#39;s DF Sensor is market-ready?

Another source says a Fed Reserve insider has warned that they may face data that signals &#34;Recession&#39; and then blame would be aimed at the Fed for acting too slowly - with a hint that we could see a Rate Cut triggered to as deep as 1 Basis Point (1%). What I take from reading this and other recent Fed related articles - we are about to see history repeat itself from the Carter-to-Reagan economic shift period, where the Fed would do rapid cuts and even increases as the economy gyrated, with cuts being 1% moves and not just the small 1/4% ones we&#39;ve become more accustomed to in the modern day.

Yahoo,2024-09-04,"The Chinese Consul General of New York was just expelled, a follow-on decision after the arrest of the Chinese Agent that was a former aide to NY Governor Hochul. This latest decision comes as result of coordination between NY and the State Dept, but signals yet more arrests and/or purges of Chinese agents and officials could be coming to a state near you.There is a growing anti-China sentiment in DC and many states now, and this only lends more support to ongoing efforts to take action against Hesai and similar companies that are forward-based operations of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).And here&#39;s a familiar story - the arrested Chinese Agent was receiving the bribes/payoff money via her spouse. We&#39;ve seen a lot of govt officials&#39; and politicians&#39; spouses achieve significant wealth in the last couple decades. And we wonder why so many factories in the USA closed and outsourced production from China - often with the closed US factories&#39; tooling and assembly lines packed up and shipped to China.The MO of this arrested Chinese Agent - to block any meetings requested by representatives of Taiwan, who sought an audience with NY Officials (to include the Governor).",Neutral,0,0.9988899827003479,Main

Many of those will be repeat customers and some will scale up.  My guess is that infrastructure(Smart Grant $500mil) will scale up prior to robotics even though Serv has begun it&#39;s build out.  It could be that the military will be first to scale up and that&#39;s likely considered robotics so there&#39;s that.Security is an additional vertical.  I see some overlap there with infrastructure.  ADAS is not yet ramping and until our new chip and form factor reduction are out it probably won&#39;t happen wrt revenues.

website:
In the past three years, traffic accidents have left more than 120,000 people dead and sent more than 10 million to the emergency room. That&#39;s 6.27 people in an ambulance to the emergency room every single minute. In the same time frame, the American economy has lost over $120 billion each year due to traffic with drivers spending an average of 97 hours in congestion annually. That&#39;s over 3 days, per driver, of lost time, each year. With accurate safety and traffic analytics that inform actionable changes from city and traffic planners these problems are solvable.

I pay attention to the posts here, and some of you may have missed it at the time - one of Rola&#39;s last posts here on the OUST board, that was either deleted by him or removed by Yahoo - stated that there was anger at UBS for Ouster recently paying off their $42M debt in August, a Line of Credit that had been put in place as a refinancing deal, about 6 month ago (replaced a prior Loan Shark deal with horrible rates). This UBS deal came with a catch - OUST had to put up over $50M in Restricted Cash to hold the Line of Credit with UBS. Considering that UBS had over $1M per quarter in Interest payments going to them, and that the Restricted Cash deposit over $50M had to be freed up back to OUST, the comment by Rola has merit. As many here know, Rola often gave what was borderline Inside Information on this board, like he practically knew Ouster&#39;s legal counsel.UBS can be ruthless, especially the Swiss headquarters (they have secondary headquarters in Germany btw. While I often default to criticism of Hesai, who always has an axe to grind here, I think Rola probably had the best insight as to how we ended up here.

Often an overlooked aspect of stock buybacks, but shareholders that experience an increased share price are not yet taxed, whereas if the company paid a dividend instead, that would have been taxed.The company finds their stock undervalued. Management knows if the company will meet expectations, yet if the stock price does not reflect either their past performance metrics (P/S and/or P/E), and is not fairly valued for known future performance (PEG), a company would wisely buy back its own shares in anticipation of meeting or exceeding performance that near-guarantees the company buys back shares at a price lower than what it should trade toward later.",Positive,1,0.7064233422279358,Main

Although we had the benefit of an Institution-led run-up last Quarter, partly due to timing of Ouster being added back into the Russell 3000 Index, Ouster was also not yet becoming the clear winner in the LiDAR race.  Now? There is real fear out there - of Ouster&#39;s competitors, and of the financial Institutions that wrongly guessed as to who would become a successful LiDAR developer and manufacturer. Those Institutions only have themselves to blame - in many cases, they put lower tier Analysts on the task of determining who the best LiDAR companies are, and as often happens, they were fooled by glossy tri-folds and Investor Presentations while the Analyst did not fully understand the Hard Science of the underlying technology - Electro-Optical LiDAR Sensors. These are mostly analysts that in their day job, normally cover Auto Parts companies that make tires and brakes.  Very few &#34;Pick a Stock&#34; firms picked Ouster to emerge the victor. While we do have Vanguard and Blackrock support, they are &#34;buy everything&#34; firms and don&#39;t selectively pick winners.That fear of Ouster&#39;s competitors - both geo-political (Hesai, Robosense) and tech/sales wise (all other US-based LiDAR) has made enemies.

Conclusion, anyone selling at these levels is selling at a valuation of 2.15x revenues for a business that will increase revenues by 30% this year.

Cantor over-bought into MVIS a long time ago, essentially placed their bets on MicroVision winning out in LiDAR, and made a big mistake. They have an interest in recouping lost money in MVIS, and have not bought into OUST like they could have, to this point. Citi, who also chose poorly, over-leveraging themselves into LAZR at higher prices, always favoring high Price Targets on LAZR while low-balling Price Targets on OUST. Their analyst covering both LAZR and OUST was in the bottom 20 of over 6,000 analysts for performance. Won&#39;t be surprised if he was fired already.GS, who favors INVZ, was a holder of INVZ shares and helped orchestrate their secondary offer, although things may have turned and GS may have sold off all INVZ holdings at this point. GS was never favorable toward OUST and is still on the sidelines for an analyst to cover Ouster. Considering that OUST went public via SPAC, and GS has typically been anti-SPAC, there&#39;s that aspect also.Speaking of SPAC, there&#39;s a long list of anti-SPAC institutions, some of which have still not bought into OUST, out of &#34;principle&#34; of their own internal rules.

While they have other Airport installations also in the works - a place like Orlando is such a tourist hub, it is a good reference point because many of us have been there before.

I continued to research and discovered Ouster. The difference between Ouster and the perceived LiDAR leader Luminar could not be any more stark.

Yahoo,2024-08-06,"I’ve now decided it would be irresponsible for me to invest in OUST, although I do believe LiDAR has an excellent future.  I was fully disappointed in the manner I was responded to, and the accusations that were made.  Reading the posts, there are obviously more people that feel that way.  I’m going to stick around as the commentary is quite revealing and eventually my original questions will be answered.",Negative,-1,0.99950110912323,Main
Yahoo,2024-08-06,What I don’t understand is why bscoms aliases trash other companies while OUST is by far the worst of the worst.  It would be out of business if it didn’t assume Velodyne’s technology and cash by merging.  It would have been delisted if it didn’t do a 10:1 reverse share split.  It’s lost $940 million…think about that.,Negative,-1,0.9999101161956787,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-05,A bit of market manipulation to the downside today. OUST dropped over $1 and yet fewer than 100K shares had traded at the time. We&#39;ve seen 100K share sell blocks that moved the stock far less than $1 in the past. Today is all about sentiment and the MMs are feasting on the panic.,Negative,-1,0.9787823557853699,Main
