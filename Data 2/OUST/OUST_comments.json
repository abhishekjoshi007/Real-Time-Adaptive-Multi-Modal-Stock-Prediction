But its an interesting thought exercise If you were given 85 million signing bonus plus an even sicker compensation package, what changes would you make to prove you were worth it? Myself, my forte is in making services and products undeniably great, and letting quality drive the business side. Not to the exclusion of shrewd business strategy and tactics, but I just put the priority on having something great that people want, and letting that be the flywheel. So for me, Id finally accept the incredibly common perception that Starbucks actual coffee is mediorceburnt. Weve seen others publicly and with humility accept and fix that... see McCafe, DPZ, CMG, etc. For those who say you cant make that change! I say you cant expect big changes unless you make changes. For those who say the old is good enough, I point to the stock performance as proof its not. Id be the best quality and go with a nicer but more broadly appealing taste profile. As SBUX, wed have the scale and resources to get the very best while still benefitting from scale. Im not sweating about margins in the first wave of this transformation because frankly a drink that you can charge a food price for suggests margin not be a problem over time. Second Id embrace some tech. People are kind of over the myth that you need a slow paced barista teasing out your drink for five minutes. CafeLux and Nespresso have shown you can get 90 of great coffee or cold drinks without lifting a finger. Id seek to take the best of learnings from those and apply them to a faster service model. Maybe that means the barista role is to focus on the part only they can do, and do best, but spares them from the other 90. Thats still TBD, but the goal of pumping out the actual drinks, cold or hot, WAY faster is not negotiable. In parallel wed have some kind of highly mediamentionable value choices. Perhaps not the 99 cent coffee that every pundit thinks they were the first to think of, since it would only be reinforcing the oldbad taste and also trading short term traffic surge which isnt the problem for weaker reputation and perception. But maybe some quick and easy 3 buck options that are enough to generate broad public knowledge. The taste and speed have to be newsworthy upgrades. The value options must also generate a buzz, but should be aligned with supporting not undermining the first two priorities. There would be more phases, but the emergency mission would be whole new supply and taste, combined with huge efficiency boost by automating that which can be. That phase alone probably justifies yesterdays 20 billion move."

I just dont understand why they dont spend time and resources searching for someone who thinks they can do it and has a plan. To me, it seems lazy and disgusting. This guy better do a real good job with how much they are handing over. Do you know what I mean? Its a big job sure but this mentality of thinking just this guy can do the job looks stupid to me. Maybe Im wrong, I guess the important thing to them is that they spend the money on the guy they think has the best odds of accomplishing their goals. And id take the money too, but its hard to not feel negative about one man getting all this money but I do suppose he has a big job ahead that will likely be stressful. But doesnt everyone feel that way about their jobs....ok Ill stop. Lol. And I read a comment, they have taken out seating. Yeah Im sure you need to get paid a few million for being that issue to light lol. I hardly ever go there because Im not into spending my money on that, dont go to Dunkin either. But the one thing I can recall about Starbucks is how the food in display looks like fake cardboard or something and isnt appetizing looking at all. I felt like asking if food is real. I think I tried it once bc I wanted to know if it was real lol, it was good I believe but I was definitely hungry after still. Idk they want to sell us small food and expensive coffee and theyll pay a lot money to do it. His first idea probably will be adding burritos to the menu. Lol"

My friend is a nurse. They went from 9 to 3 nurses on her ward. So all the nurses are overworked patients are more unhappy but in the end, the numbers look better as they have less costs. So as a result, the board gives themselves a bonus which is almost equivalent to the cut costs...

If it was me, Id axe half the menu, focus on core product offerings similar to what Intelligentsia does and theyre the best coffee chain in the US imho, close stores that arent seeing high foot traffic, segregate in store service from the orders that come in via apps as customers tend to wait for long periods in stores due to baristas fulfilling app orders, and Id reduce prices a bit no one wants to pay 68 for subpar coffee .

Teslas misleading marketing, he said, has had the dangerous effect of providing overconfidence and building you up to thinking its safer than it actually is. Wiki list of Tesla lawsuits In the list you can find In August 2022, a consumer class action was filed alleging that the Autopilot system in Tesla cars contains a hazardous defect which causes the vehicle to suddenly and unintentionally brake, a phenomenon dubbed phantom braking.3637 As of March 2024, the case is unresolved. This one was settled because the solar tiles were fake In 2021, Tesla Solar Roof customers who had signed contracts with the company sued after they were later presented with price hikes and delays. Following the courts consolidation of the individual cases, Tesla created a program offering to return the prices to their original amounts to those affected.177178 In 2023, Tesla settled the lawsuit for 6 million. This one is unresolved and I trust musk will be condemned Deceptive Autopilot and Full SelfDriving advertising edit In September 2022, a proposed class action federal lawsuit was filed against Tesla for Elon Musk allegedly misleading customers who since 2016 bought or leased Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full SelfDriving features with his predictions that Teslas would soon be fully autonomous cars.43 Over 300,000 vehicles were recalled due to being unsafe around intersections.44 As of March 2024, the case is unresolved.45 And there are so many more including child labor, racism, labor rights....."

In fact, the fact that she was prosecuted for fraud suggests that our legal system does, in fact, chase these allegations. So why did Holmes and Theranos get prosecuted, and Musk doesnt, when Musk is easily more notable and publicfacing? 2016 article Elon Musk says fully selfdriving Tesla cars already being built No, thats the clickbait headline. The article actually says that he said All new Tesla models are being built with hardware to enable them to be fully selfdriving, Elon Musk has announced. Having the hardware to be selfdriving doesnt mean that the car is currently capable of selfdriving. The German government has called on Elon Musks company to stop using the Autopilot branding Ok? That doesnt mean hes committed fraud lol. As Elon Musk promises full selfdriving, experts worry Tesla is using consumers as guinea pigs Nothing in this article suggests that Musk has made fraudulent claims. alleging that the Autopilot system in Tesla cars How is this linked to Musk making fraudulent claims? sued after they were later presented with price hikes and delays How is this criminal fraud? They sued for damages and won them because Tesla didnt live up to its contract, but thats not fraud, and its especially not fraud from Musk something his company doesnt deliver on is not personal liability for a criminal offense. This one is unresolved and I trust musk will be condemned This is maybe the only one that would prove your point... but its unresolved, and its odd that you think hes going to lose, given that hes been sued for false claims in the past and the case was dismissed. And there are so many more including child labor, racism, labor rights..... This sentence represents the issue with your entire comment. It seems that I need to remind you that Im not making any argument about Musk being a good person. You said He should be in prison for financial fraud And now youve simply proceeded to not make any arguments about that, and have moved the goalposts to other topics which I did not make any comment about. Control your thoughts and stay on topic. This is not a place to comment generally on Musk, because I dont give a fuck about Musk. I care about you making claims that he should be in jail for financial fraud without making any solid argument for him having actually committed that act."

Youll say oh but thats not a crime to add fake cheers in a video ok shut up and listen. The reason his downfall is taking such a long time is precisely because of people like you and his whole image being that of a genius entrepreneur. I strongly recommend you watch at least one Thunderf00t video where he debunks Musk, itll take you less time than to keep arguing here. Thunderf00t is credible and he is in fact an expert on EVs more than 99 of people because what makes EVs special is the battery and hes a chemist. His channel is a debunking channel. He debunks fake inventions and things that get covered on the news while obviously gigantic scams.

Our health system is predatory to the extreme and only accessible to the wealthiest among us. Our police force is murderously violent, and protects corporate interests above the citizenry. Our financial systems have been completely overrun by billionaire fraudsters and now operate on boom and bust cycles that pilfer public funds. Our food production has been brutally industrialized and our food itself has been stuffed with toxic additives and overprocessed to squeeze out every last cent of profit. Unions and workers rights have been demonized and systematically deconstructed. Worker pay has been under gradual decline for half a century, while housing has become yet another investment vehicle causing costs to skyrocket. Our politicians, fully and openly bought by the oligarchs, obstruct any attempt at change while engaging in public hedonism. And all the while, we are drowning in unending propaganda pushing American exceptionalism, praising rugged individualism, and demonizing kindness, generosity, and collectiveness. So, yeah. Things arent great here. The capitalists have us in a pretty dark hole, but were working on it.

So he is hired to cut costs, like a lot of other temporary CEOs. I believe the real brain rot is in shareholder and wall street attitude towards fully matured business models. They should be on cruise control paying out dividends or securing their large moat. Instead they must produce innovation or margin expansion and act like they are about to release a cancer cure at all times. 2x returns on PE expansion or it aint worth it, even to a retiree stock portfolio. Those investors if so desperate should honestly sell their starnucks and look for newcomers in the coffee market if they want 3x returns, but no.

If you are good and can get offers from many companies, you have a higher negotiating power. That is why their bonus doesnt get cut as often. Theyre not going to start cutting executive bonuses first Starbucks suffered from a bad CEO. That is why they fired the CEO and hired a new one. That already contradicts what you said. Not even cutting bonus. Just fire. Contrary to the popular belief, execs are important. If execs do badly, the company will suffer. That is why they are paid higher than anyone else, so the company can attract good CEOs."

Gross profit is simply the revenue minus COGS. That, in this case, is rideshare revenue minus electricity costs and tire costs, and nothing more it doesnt consider things like debt or cost of capital. Its not farfetched to think that a robotaxi could bring in that kind of gross profit per year."

The old, dugin board and execs never articulated any actual plan they might have for fixing the share price of the worst Dow stock, just trashing of Peltz. That same old and negative board is the same one thats presided over a decade of being the most shareholderaverse stock possible.

Sure, itll probably take a hit short term and Im already in as of this morning, but there are longer term prospects that Im more focused on. My issues with DIS arent investmentrelated, theyre operational. In short, they just need to get their sht together. With a new CTO and team incoming, I believe theyll get there.

But Im talking about the other 99 of the time since their selfish and destructive proxy vote. One thing is they announced a big price hike on streaming. Whether that works or drives away customers we cant know yet. But we do know that it doesnt take any special genius to say how about we jack the price? Even Laxman could have come up with that one. The other thing is announcing capital heavy villains park renovations. It remains to be seen how that will affect the stock short term or long term. In theory, heavy capital spend now might not be good for the shareholders they already fleeced with their smear campaign money burning, or their listless destruction of 37 of the company value in just the last few months. Long term, who knows? Maybe it will be perceived as an investment that will have a much delayed Return On investment.

Selling Pixar to MAPPA, Walt Disney Animation Studios to Pure Flix, Lucasfilm to The Epoch Times, Marvel Studios to The Daily Wire, 20th Century Studios to X Corp Elon Musks company, and so on. As for your other point There are others in Disneys industries that are absolutely eating while Disneys board has burned away 37 of their already diminished market cap. Well, your examples mostly specializes on one specific thing while Disney works on a lot of entertainment sector at once. And before you mention Universal, even they apparently seem to have attendance rate issues with their theme parks as of now. P.S.

Some of the Disney stock value issues could also be due to PeltzPerlmutter supporters giving up on Disney after Peltz lost at least when it comes to earlier ones and there was also a Disneyland strike that almost happened just a few weeks ago.

No ones writing accolades about Netflix original, but they are smashing earnings because they can keep their cost down to predictable level.

Many institutions sell stocks to log in the entry, even if they intend to buy back later. Once we get past tomorrow, Oct 31st, we enter a more bullish period for the market as we approach the window for the Christmas rally period as well. With such a heavy separation of the market&#39;s view of Election Day, that&#39;s the next big hurdle, and one could argue that Ouster wins either way, because in either case you would have either anti-China sentiment (DJT) or a pro-West Coast sentiment (Ouster in San Fran, a district that KH is beholden to, including Sister Nancy P. and her fickle husband). I&#39;ve seen numerous scenarios run for either candidate winning, and you get wins either way. Either Pete B. as Transportation Secretary may gain even more influence (and already has the back of Ouster), or you get so much anti-China trade sentiment that anyone operating autonomous platforms or even simply ADAS, or even a tractor/combine near a US Military base - none of those will be allowed to have a Chinese-Hesai sensor that can map out the environment. Feel free to counter-point/argue here, I&#39;d enjoy seeing the pros/cons of either side winning, but I think the wins for Ouster balance out no matter who wins."

Perhaps this is China&#39;s answer to &#34;No Chinese LiDAR&#34; on vehicles sold inside the USA/Western world due to security concerns related to LiDAR&#39;s ability to map out the environment (we wouldn&#39;t want Chinese LiDAR mapping out an area near or inside a US Military base, as example)."

If you wanted to be even more conservative in your Fair Value analysis, you could use TTM P/S 5 that puts a more conservative mark at $10.30 but that is still above the current OUST trading range."

For these higher risk stocks that are quite different from my normal holdings of boring REITs that pay distributions and rarely move much in stock price, OUST is at a very low point in its valuation curve. Could OUST go a lot lower and present an even better Entry Point than today? Sure, any stock could. The super-volcano under Yellowstone National Park could blow up today, kill off 1/3 of the United States, crash our stock markets to half or below current value, and every stock in America is on sale. Chances of that happening today? Yahoo wouldn&#39;t let me post all the zero&#39;s to the right of the decimal point before entering the 1, for something like one quadgoogle(th) of a percent chance (I think that would be 400 zero&#39;s after the decimal). We don&#39;t invest based on those odds. It&#39;s just easier to say &#34;It&#39;s safe to buy under $10&#34; and not even list the 30 cents above $10 that still count towards Fair Value. Why it just doesn&#39;t matter - Ouster&#39;s customer-driven company holds tremendous potential, except just like that Super-Volcano, any of their 850 customers could &#34;erupt&#34; in a good way, and expand their fleet.(edit) and FYI, my normal MO is to buy at least a dozen or more blocks of stock when it&#39;s beaten down, just to ensure I dollar-cost average as I catch the Falling Knife. It&#39;s a technique."

Notice the compare/contrast they do as they pause the video to show Optical Sensors&#39; effects when rain lands on the Optical sensor, in contrast to LiDAR continuing to fully operate, even when the rain is also landing on the LiDAR&#39;s laser emissions area. The firmware update was the same one that reduced minimum range to zero, so notice in the video how the sensor&#39;s portrayed scan is clear from the platform outward, as it&#39;s a much cleaner scan now."

Technically, &#34;last quarter&#34; was 3rd Quarter since we&#39;re in 4th Quarter now, and that Q3 is not public, no 10-Q to review yet, data is not yet auto-loaded here in Yahoo stats. Debt was &#34;paid off&#34; in August, mid-Q3, after Q2 books were closed and not in Q2 10-Q, so not in Yahoo Statistics here nor any other brokerage house&#39;s auto-data pull from published reports. That was a verbal statement and part of the Q2 Earnings Conf Call, that the CFO said the debt was paid in August. That was now over 2 months ago, so we don&#39;t yet know complete picture yet, because it&#39;s within Ouster&#39;s ability to easily start new debt of a small amount that would not have to be publicly reported, and even that could be an arrangement in this ongoing quarter, which would not hit the upcoming reported Q3 10-Q. Just being detailed and precise on this, because the &#34;truth&#34; changes by the day, and by the reports you can see, and what verbal information the CFO will say in the upcoming call on Nov 7th.As for &#34;where&#34; on 10-Q to see Debt, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Liabilities, in the section for non-current liabilities."

Did you know what significantly changed when computer motherboards were made to manage the electrical power for the computer/device? It meant that the motherboard and its management of both power and data - could potentially flow data in/out of the power supply as well. If you&#39;re not tracking what this leads to - data can be moved in/out of computers via the power cord and electric grid, not just by whatever means you connect to the internet. China probably has data-retransmission capabilities connected to most nations&#39; electric grids."

If you recall the prior discussion on TSMC - first they tried to deny, now they&#39;re starting to acknowledge the truth:&#34;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) said on Tuesday it has informed the United States of a potential attempt to have it manufacture AI chips for China&#39;s Huawei in circumvention of export controls. The U.S. government restricted the export of high-end AI chips to China two years ago, citing the need to limit the Chinese military&#39;s capabilities.&#34;And this is only the initial response after the evidence is overwhelming.  The ability to trust and use Taiwanese companies to carry out the most high-end of chip-making, or any subcomponent of computers, sensors, or data-processing - those days are coming to an end. The USA will have to reel in its best technology to a domestic-only approach. That day is coming sooner than you think. For one thing, if China makes a move on Taiwan, that day is already upon us.Ouster and other companies had better start looking at their entire supply chain and proof it for both China and Taiwan."

Some of us suspect Velodyne basically leveraged their patents to force the suit to happen and result in the merger. \n\nVelodyne could see the writing on the wall. They were directly competing with Ouster for many of the exact same clients. Over time, Ouster was probably going to get the Amazon bot business (early Proteus designs had both Velodyne and Ouster sensors) and more, thanks to their superior digital lidar on a chip tech. To avoid a long, slow descent into declining revenues and bankruptcy, Velodyne sought to merge.\n\nOuster wanted to avoid the costly lawsuit and get Velodyne&#39;s cash, talent and, likely, legacy patents.\n\n2. Ouster&#39;s DF sensors owe their existence to the acquisition of Sense Photonics Photonics. The Sense people figured out much of the solid state tech that Ouster is merging with their own. Lots of employees have come and gone with these mergers... not sure what the significance of Finkelstein was or was not..."

What did Velodyne get from this merger?2) On the purchase of Sense Photonics:a) Ouster bought the technology that advanced where they were trying to go.?) Why did the not keep Hod Finklestein?3) Bonus Question - :)1) Almost immediately after the Sense Photonics purchase the SP CTO went to Aeye, Inc. He only stayed a year and then went to Meta to lead their &#34;camera and depth reality labs&#34; organization. I assume he is part of the Meta Orion smart glasses program. Did his time at Aeye move their program forward to where they should be considered a threat?Lastly, I have about 8 rejected wordings of another post that I wanted to put up, but I can&#39;t get yahoo to let me do it.  Anyone understand the threshold for rejected posts?thanks,david"

(not exactly sure what this means other than processing fpga/uP/etc..)The information that I can find on the DF sensor basically is the same as above, but significantly includes two other items:5) Global Shutter.6) Digital Flash.I do not have experience with Lidar, but I do know something about camera design and RTL logic design in FPGA&#39;s.  Global shutter (as opposed to a rolling shutter) means all the pixels are exposed to the image (the light) at the same time.  This is why they don&#39;t have motion artifacts and yes, it&#39;s a big deal.  Digital Flash would burst broadcast VCSEL laser emitters simultaneously, which you can see would work well with a Global shutter.  So I have two basic questions and I&#39;m not even sure if anyone will know, but please shout out if you do.1) All of the OS series device datasheets have a specification for &#34;Rotation Rate&#34; in the range of 10 or 20 Hz.    What is this talking about?  2) Are the differences between the OS and DF series of devices summed up in the Global Shutter and Digital Flash capabilities or am I missing an important item?Lastly, question #2 is not meant to say &#34;That&#39;s not enough&#34;..  actually that&#39;s a huge deal, but I am still curious for the answer.thanks,david"

It&#39;s Lose-Lose for the USA, because there is proof that Huawei obtained US Tech under the table from TSMC, as the precise match in spec&#39;s could not have been arrived at any other way (China did not have the means to get there before the tech transfer). While you can see many stories being spun by TSMC because it doesn&#39;t want this incident to affect their company, they&#39;re lying through their teeth. Taiwan has over 1M people commuting to mainland China now - monthly/weekly/daily even, depending on income level and the status of the job. The Chinese have successfully intermarried with Taiwanese and you&#39;ll see Taiwan &#34;won&#34; without a shot fired, or even if it is a military seizure - it will be much less than expected because the people are shifting pro-China and compromised as they fade from traditional Taiwanese independence in their values. Why this matters for Ouster - they cannot trust outsourcing to Taiwan for any patented/proprietary production at this point, for subcomponents. I realize Thailand has the fabs to assemble the sensors, but some of the guts come from Taiwan. This is yet another reason to call your Congressman and tell them you want to remove dependence on China AND Taiwan for our chips and all the parts and pieces required for computerization (and automation).https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-says-prompt-action-ensure-113227813.html"

Thus - next-gen nuclear power, preferably Thorium fueled (such as variants of Molten Salt Reactors or MSRs, among many others) where the wholesale cost for electricity could be as low as .4 Cents/KWH. For those that know what normal wholesale rates are, that&#39;s about 90% less than any other low-cost power like current Light Water Reactors (LWR) that are the only type among our large-scale nuclear power plants around the country, and even the cheapest of coal is also much higher percentage wise. You may get to 2.5 Cents/KWH from the cheapest of LWRs and Coal, maybe, at the lowest, but with new regulations and personnel costs, it&#39;s getting more toward 4 Cents/KWH, same as Natural Gas. Those MSRs btw, can be such a small format, any factory could buy one - the size of an SUV or shipping container, just park it outside the plant and plug it in for 10-20 years until it needs to get refueled and/or replaced."

These are the types of things &#34;real design engineers&#34; need, are looking for, want, have to have in order to work through the problems of their specific implementation.  I could go on for quite a bit on this, but after I realized this was much more than a company of hope and marketing but actually had products and development platforms I decided to go look for the same on some of the other seemingly similar companies..  Nada..  Show me another company where you can actually look at real engineers that have questions posted to the support area of the website and Ouster FAEs answering the questions?I know something about this environment..  and I&#39;m telling you, these guys are way out front."

Most of us know - Ouster&#39;s debt was paid off in August, but after Q2 closed, so it did not hit the books yet, and - it&#39;s not on any brokerage house&#39;s data set for OUST, and if you click &#34;Statistics&#34; here in Yahoo Finance, you&#39;ll see the old balance of Debt.Just consider - any 3rd party, individual investor/trader at Retail level, or the highest-tier Analyst at a big institution - OUST will look totally different as an investment after this upcoming 10-Q is released. Debt position will be cleaned up. Cash remaining after paying off Debt will be resolved, but the reduction in costs of the $1M Debt payments will be gone, further showing Ouster&#39;s effectiveness at Cost Controls as they approach the runway for Profitability.This is just to say that - even the random stock pickers out there, are more likely to pick OUST as a Buy at this point, and not just because of TTM P/S Ratio valuation analysis as I tend to gravitate toward - the many other stats are getting cleaned up this quarter, along with yet another improvement in Year-over-Year Revenue Growth. We should expect an entirely new group of Retail Investors to enter OUST after this upcoming 10-Q is out."

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) already made the point that collaboration occurs in LiDAR factories in Mainland China, and Chinese military equipment is already showing up at Trade Shows with Hesai LiDAR on it. Hesai is skirting oversight by selling as a subcomponent provider when the direct sale is to the vendor of the component. Sure, Hesai doesn&#39;t sell directly to the People&#39;s Liberation Army (PLA). Instead, Hesai sells to the Component vendor to the PLA. Just remember - we don&#39;t have the smartest people working for Govt these days."

I think I may buy myself a new bandsaw. I have a very nice 18&#34; Rikon, but I&#39;ve had my eye on an even nicer Laguna for a while now. I could give the Rikon to my son which would move him up as well. I wish there was a way to post pics here..Also, I noticed that said to someone in this thread a day or two ago that you would send him an email. Does that mean 1) you knew him and had a comms. connection prior to here or 2) is there a safe way to exchange contact information on this thread?thanks,davidAlso, I just noticed a very familiar number at the bottom of the first image in the Serve article.. &#34;2,000 of Serve Robotics new third-generation robots are set to wheel into new cities and neighborhoods in 2025.&#34;"

For those that know - Magna is headquartered in Canada (Puck probably knows them well).  With sub Magna Steyr in Austria, there&#39;s a good probability that Serve gains a leg-up to expand operations in Europe as result, but very TBD. For now, Serve is simply focusing on US cities to expand to. Not sure that they&#39;ll operate in Canada (in winter) - they may need to fatten the tires or make a tracked version instead."

They made the excuse that an expected sale in the quarter was not booked. Maybe they thought it sounded like a good excuse when Ouster used it last quarter. Regardless, MVIS was justifiably sold off today, because their early release of earnings tried to announce a move into Industrial sales of LiDAR, and that they had talked to Auto OEMs and had participated in several RFP/RFQs (they basically said - MVIS deserves a Participation Trophy). That Sumit Sharma, I tell ya - he makes us all appreciate that Angus Pacala is the CEO of Ouster."

The takeaway is that the 3.1 firmware has the capacity to separate very nearfield masses from others.  This in turn gives them the ability to filter out obstructions on the glass of the sensor.  I expect there is some pretty decent math going on behind this in that they still have the full image, without the artifacts of the obstructions on the glass.  The demo is a live image as the camera is being sprayed with a water bottle.  The new firmware image does not seem to change at all.  Well worth looking at..  and obviously a very strong selling point to many of their potential customers."

Pre-profitability Growth stocks such as OUST and all other LiDAR companies in the Western world, should be valued using Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio analysis, with TTM P/S 5 as the most conservative mark. This is age-old wisdom from the 1930s, after the 1929 crash when Stock Market Analysts had to get away from Speculation. If you don&#39;t have profits, you can&#39;t factor P/E, PEG nor FWD P/E either. P/S can be factored, however. It&#39;s a rear-view mirror approach, forcing the upstart company to &#34;prove it&#34; with Performance Data. This valuation method results in the safest way to assess value instead of the glossy tri-folds at Investor Conferences, and the speeches that CEOs give. Luminar, in contrast, tries to push their Order Book that include sales projections that don&#39;t have signed deals. Ouster instead only bases their future on signed deals in their Booked Orders, making Ouster much more conservative fiscally. This is why you can put more trust in Ouster earnings projections than their peers, and TTM P/S 5 = $10.30 as a minimum Fair Value mark. The current price level around $7 is a safe Entry Point for the stock, even if the 10-Q comes in line at the middle of the earnings range (Fair Value goes up even if they only hit the middle as Y-over-Y would have grown)."

Fabrinet (FN), the old Seagate HDD factory, makes legacy sensors (not sure if anything like OS or only the truly legacy stuff now). Then Benchmark (BHE) makes the newer stuff, and I think the entire OS Family line of sensors, but someone else may know more of the specifics if that wasn&#39;t precise. What I&#39;ve argued in the past - negotiate with FN and BHE to come up with a US-based facility as Plan B, try to get Dept of Defense funding when/if a US-based production facility for military sensors is needed at high rate. Ouster&#39;s internal capacity in San Fran can do some production but I don&#39;t know what their monthly/annual production rate is, if they did ever have to bring it all home. I think it would be better to have FN or BHE set up something in the USA instead of Ouster. I&#39;m still humored about my old comment about &#34;Dorien&#34; who used to post here a lot. There is a &#34;Darien Spencer&#34; that is COO, and he used to work for Seagate (probably the FN connection btw). I pointed out way back, that Dorien was very knowledgeable and maybe was Darien Spencer (hiding behind a single vowel) - never saw &#34;Dorien&#34; post in Yahoo again after that, no kidding (and I think he changed his handle, as I may have accidentally &#34;outed&#34; him). FYI, of the 2, I&#39;d rather invest in BHE than FN but I&#39;d be interested to hear others&#39; take on those companies for the longer term."

It was to prove how quickly they could surround the island of Taiwan in one day. China&#39;s goal is to win Taiwan without a shot fired. They will attack and take it, if their calculus calls for it but they will stay patient for an opening. If we put you in charge of negotiations, you&#39;d just give them Taiwan for free, right Harry Balz?"

There was a change in the Chinese Stimulus program, as the EV and related industries abroad may get cut off, due to ongoing policy changes already happening now, and expected to worsen for China&#39;s trade if Donald Trump is elected. Chinese Automotive Industry related companies inside the USA may be forced to shut down, and the many ventures in Mexico and Canada now appear to be at risk also, as they were attempts to skirt tariffs. The surprise move has been the manufacturing Unions in the USA, now shifting toward GOP support instead of longstanding Democrat alignment that was assumed to be permanent. Things change when factories close in our country, and even worse when foreign companies show up down the road from the closed plant, or just across the border in Mexico, to do the same job. Will this be the end of Hesai in the USA? Likely, it will be Bye, Bye, Hesai if Trump is elected. There is already Bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to continue to push against Chinese Robotaxi sales and operations inside the USA, LiDAR sales/operations as well, and that list could grow. The interesting thing is that under the Biden Administration, this movement has been favorable, on the surface, but the current President has not forcefully acted upon it even though he&#39;s in a Lame Duck situation. The current administration has paid lip service to being tough on China, while not fully carrying that out on paper."

LAZR sliding towards all-time low. Also solidifies their Reverse Split. Money will exit LAZR, some will go to OUST. INVZ also languishing in hopes of a rescue via news of any sort, but they will also face delisting or RS. Tesla is also going to shed investors who are looking for the real deal in Autonomy, after the Sci-Fi make-believe event last week. To this point, the only major articles talking &#34;who wins when Tesla loses&#34; (for Robotaxi) point to Uber and Lyft. There&#39;s a delayed reaction, but Ouster is a winner also, because OUST supplies 3 of the top-4 Robotaxi companies (and maybe all 4 if Waymo is confirmed). Oh, and word on the Street is that China is preparing to pack up certain US based companies if Trump wins, especially Auto related (bye bye Hesai). The Chinese stimulus is being held back from certain Chinese Auto industry companies because of what could change."

He spells words in their Euro version, and he&#39;s probably on a typical European Fall Vacation. On the other side of the fence, we have former &#34;Ted&#34; that name-changed to &#34;Harry Balz&#34; (classy name there Ted), and interestingly Ted was giving the same flawed argument a week ago, as if Ouster&#39;s growth is only from getting Velodyne&#39;s customers - that new account &#34;Joey&#34; just tried to make today. I find that very interesting that they argued the same point, in the same way. Almost scripted. Joey also became very argumentative once Hesai was criticized. Almost looked like it was Ted or Puck who forgot to log off Joey (that happens a lot around here - the multi-account spammers forget to switch accounts).  So - what will &#34;Break the Phalanx&#34; with you guys at this point? Will it be OUST returning to double digits, up in the $15 range? Or maybe it will be Hesai closing down all U.S. based operations, and HSAI delisted from US Stock markets? And for you &#34;mike&#34; - you have done your homework, right, to look at past performance around 10-Q reporting periods when a good earnings report comes out from OUST? I&#39;d assume you&#39;ve seen that pattern, that a good earnings report can drive the stock up 10% or even a lot more, and it can go quickly and create a Short Squeeze once that level of volume kicks in."

It&#39;s very clear what their strategy is outside of automotive if you simply read basic information about the Verticals they sell into. That you claim there are little references is laughable, as it&#39;s quite obvious with basic research. You appear to ask that as if criticizing Ouster when the opposite is true. Plenty of 10-Q/K and Earnings Call Audio/Transcripts and articles galore about Ouster focusing outside Automotive. You frame all your questions as if you&#39;ve done research, then ask that last one as if you did no research. It&#39;s baffling, unless you&#39;re simply here with an Agenda."

TBD. Ouster&#39;s management has been ultra-conservative fiscally when it comes to making revenue forecasts. They don&#39;t hype themselves or the stock. We&#39;ve had fairly stable reporting periods other than last quarter, for a long time now. The Year-over-Year revenue growth is more important, they&#39;re hitting those numbers well (last quarter was in the 36-39% improvement from year ago). The CFO has said that very thing - as if Ouster does have a bit of a cyclical pace it is getting into, where the last quarter of the year is now the largest, as a going trend. The CFO said the Annual Revenue Growth rate will be 30-50%, but that Q-over-Q will not pace that way. No complaints here. There&#39;s a lot of tech companies that wish they had consistent 30-50% Y-over-Y growth."

Where does the funding come from?- Latest quarter results reflect a 4% sequential revenue increase to $27M. Apparently there was a delay (in shipping ?) one large order. Has Ouster indicated who the customer is and why the delay?- Why is the revenue forecast only $27- 29M for the current quarter? Has this been adjusted upward since the last report, due to the large order delay?- Has Ouster decided to focus on non automotive autonomous business? I see very little reference to this very important area for the more expensive and likely better margin sensor sales."

First thing I noticed in the video was a familiarly shaped sensor on top of the vehicle. After just a bit of page scrolling on their website the name on the sensor brought a huge smile to my face.They have a patent on MPDM.  I hope they fully defined it and that it is as broad as it should be.Think about what you see on your smart phone driving app.  It tells you where the traffic, roadwork, easy sailing, etc..  is for your current trip.  It does this via a “LTE” connection to the nearest tower.  That’s where NTT comes into the picture.  So the obvious idea behind the news article is the May Mobility platform has a LTE transceiver it can use to give/get pertinent data to make better driving decisions via the cell-phone network or some other band they have allocated that NTT is in control of.Don’t know what Rf links Ouster has, but some type of LTE optional feature could be very useful for customers who see the value of linked devices, but don’t have the ability (for multiple reasons) do it themselves👍"

I&#39;ve seen where certain IC manufacturers would intentionally make their devices unfriendly to connect to with anything other than their own complimentary chips.  Sometimes it works out well, other times it sunk the ship.   Ouster could drive a communications protocol with sub libraries and structures each of which would have information specific to what usage the sensor was in.  It could then broadcast that information (the structure) to the autonomous machines that would use the data to improve their performance.  In the case of traffic control it would consist to things like (current  &amp; time at (stop/caution/go)), jaywalker, emergency vehicle, malfunctioning signal, etc...  then the robo-auto_entity that could receive the broadcast packets and decode them could use them.  It would be a way to allow (in house developed auto manufacturers&#39; lidars) to also take advantage of the Ouster Blue City implementations and possibly get the support of these same manufacturers.  If they were successful at this it would internally connect their technology to the auto manufacturers which could be very positive down the road in multiple ways."

At the same time, It seems very reasonable that the first actual automotive usage for this technology will be these &#34;in town&#34; robo-taxi/bus services and point to point trucking routes.  I am aware of the trucking providers that use Ouster, but not as clear on the robo-taxi/bus manufacturers.  If Ouster plays this correctly, they could/should own the robo-taxi/bus manufacturer slots.  Pitch the combined AI ability of the robo-taxi/bus entities working in tandem with the Blue-City control of in-town traffic.  Nobody, other than Ouster, has the capacity to claim the real-time traffic control system is actually communicating and working with the autonomous robo-taxi/bus traffic.  Seems like a no-brainer to me..  Where is Ouster being used in the Robotaxi &amp; RoboBus providers?"

In fact, Tesla is not even in the Top-3 for all of the product reveals.Robots: Amazon Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Apple, and nearly a dozen total companies making individual/personal Robots (many Chinese and Japanese companies also) are all ahead of Tesla&#39;s Optimus. A way to describe it is that Optimus has toddler/preschool level scripted responses and mirror-image response mechanisms, whereas their competition has graduate level autonomy. Optimus is 10 years behind their best competition.Robotaxis: Google/Waymo, GM Cruise, Zoox, Hyundai/Motional, and all the Chinese Robotaxi companies - are all ahead of Tesla, with those first 4 already achieving Certification levels above Tesla that will take years to catch up. A Forbes article called it a 7-year difference between top company Waymo and Tesla, primarily because the pace to achieve Level 5 Autonomous Driving (Full Autonomy) is nearly there for Waymo right now, whereas Robocab will be delivered in 2 years, not Level 4 by then, and TBD to achieve Level 5. So who will buy Robocab in 2 years when it may sit idle awaiting legal Certification to operate? Reminder, Elon decided to have no steering wheel or pedals in Cybercab, which may make it a brick until Level 5 Certified.Robobus: Multiple autonomous buses already on the road all over the world, some at airports. Not likely a sought-after vehicle by commercial limousine services."

I don&#39;t know if they lucked into it, or if they actually had the idea and executed on it, but either way they&#39;re way out front now in multiple industries with a mass producible solid state solution and not competing with every Thom, Dickwo, and Hari for the slot.

Tesla, as result, is also a competitor of Hesai and all other Chinese LiDAR companies. Last, Market Cap and R&amp;D expenditure levels have nothing to do with whether 2 companies compete.

Today&#39;s news reemphasized other issues with Tesla that I haven&#39;t voiced much here, but you should consider the growing list:GEICO denied/cancelled policies for Tesla Cybertruck, as the liability/risks are too lengthy and more being added as inspections and wear reveal significant design flaws.Cybertruck design added aluminum components in areas where Vertical Loads are significant for towing trailers, which means a Cybertruck could rip itself apart if it has a max Gross Weight trailer load, and now the 3rd party engineers looking at this flaw are saying that Cybertruck may need to be reduced to very light trailers that only put around 100 pounds on the tongue. No doubt - Cybertruck&#39;s electric motors have plenty of torque to pull heavy loads, but those heavy loads still put weight vertically on the tongue and hitch, which means Tesla engineers obviously haven&#39;t worked with trailers and truck suspensions much at all in their careers.Tesla Optical sensors degrade over time, with clouding much like headlamp covers, leading to degradation of photons passively received. This is like having an elderly person with cataracts as the autopilot. Bad eyes, no matter how good Dojo is.Chinese dependency for batteries and vehicle production long term. Elon doesn&#39;t prioritize Western production long term."

The CCP maintains plausible deniability for their involvement with all of China&#39;s hacking operations, while subsidizing all of their best hackers along the way. There is no such thing as &#34;private vs government&#34; business in China. The CCP is intertwined in everything that China does. Even their mafia, the Chinese Triad, is an arm of the CCP &#34;off the books&#34; for operations internal and external to China. Most of the Chinese restaurants inside the USA are indirectly owned and controlled by the Triad, and NPR did a story on the restaurant network for green-carded Chinese citizens who arrive into the US and funnel through NYC and San Fran as an initial reporting station, to then be farmed out to Chinese restaurants throughout the USA, often rotating the personnel, all of them live/sleep as if in China (on mats in rented houses with maximum occupancy), some restaurants are also prostitution centers, as all the restaurants are &#34;collection assets&#34; of the Triad in a role similar to the CIA in foreign countries. This is one reason the females at Chinese restaurants rotate a lot. These networked restaurants and other assets help as a feedback loop to the hackers back in China - it is interconnected in ways you don&#39;t realize. Look up the term &#34;Fifth Column&#34; and you&#39;ll see what they are."

He was low-tier CFO and the Engineer CEO didn&#39;t have the best staff yet.

Apparently the city has already applied for round 2 of the Smart Grant.  If the project is successful(Nashville is giddy) they become eligible for up to $15million in additional federal funding.Stage 1 of the Smart Grant is $2million.  My guess is that Ouster got most or maybe even all of that.  The program total is $500million over 5 years.The project had strong community support in part because the LiDAR sensors anonymatize as opposed to cameras.

None are missing, the ruling party cannot take them from me.I may sell them at anytime, without consent of the ruling party.  If hungry, I can sell three and have a hamburger.

Luminar has ties to Russian Oligarchs via GVA Capital, and growing Chinese influence to include a Chinese Geely/ECARX executice on the Luminar Board of Directors, and soon after that person joined LAZR&#39;s board, they started exploring options to shift LiDAR manufacturing to China. Hesai and all other Chinese LiDAR developers and manufacturers are under orders from the CCP that China&#39;s military (PLA) must have full access to LiDAR facilities, to include any foreign companies operating R&amp;D or manufacturing facilities in China (to extract their IP for military use)."

If OUST must double their current revenue to turn profitable, that&#39;s all it would take. The Ouster executives won&#39;t say this because they can&#39;t speak for their hundreds of customers with varying timelines (and varying chances of success to &#34;win&#34; in their particular industries). Recurring revenue from software will also start to build like a slow-rolling snowball but it&#39;s going to snowball from here.  Ouster&#39;s entire business model, currently, is reliant on independent companies that they don&#39;t control, to buy their product and services. Smart Infrastructure only gives them a slight bit more control because of software, but one of Ouster&#39;s greatest disadvantages, as we&#39;ve now seen - their future forecasts are totally dependent on external influences and companies that have varying levels of success. Ouster can still succeed in that froth of variability - as long as there&#39;s so many customers that the odds are in their favor."

It should be no surprise that Hesai was planted on US Soil and in US Markets, as their primary mission is to extract technology while experimenting on commercial assets (with full intent to use those results on military platforms of the future).The participation on various stock boards by pro-China/Hesai accounts, Russian accounts (2 different Russians spamming Luminar&#39;s board now btw) -- none of this is surprising at this point."

They do this because they think there&#39;s more leverage, as they know parents don&#39;t want to have to take vacation/sick time to care for kids that they thought would be off to school. Most Unions in the modern day do not represent what Unions were originally formed for - safety in the workplace, and fair wages. There&#39;s no Union requirement for safety - our Federal and State regulations have caught up, no more child labor, and plenty of lawyers to carry out lawsuits. In terms of workplace safety - Unions are now obsolete. &#34;Fair wages&#34; are also legislated now, with minimum wage thresholds already in place. Unions are instead just a collective wage bargaining organization to push for wages that aren&#39;t a bargain at all, which is why foreign manufacturing is sought after at home and abroad. Chinese manufacturing supplants US Union workers. US non-Union workers supplant European Union workers (thus, the reason Euro Auto manufacturers come here to the USA). We&#39;re a bit overdue for more than just Union-busting, we need to see an era of Union-destruction and dissolving."

Frankly, they sound like greedy troglodytes, and our ports would be outclassed by foreign advancement to the point that we could see shifts in business at foreign ports over our own US domestic ports, for businesses that have choices on where they may want to hub their distribution center and such.  This would be like a Union supporting those who own and care for horses to be trying to stop the development and use of automobiles on the roadways. It&#39;s a remarkable thing that this Union thinks it can win such a silly argument, to preserve their union-member jobs when the day of reckoning has come and gone for ports to adopt automation."

Strengthening the financial position and a sign that the CFO feels comfortable about cash levels.Have a look at the &#39;statistics&#39; tab here on YF and you will see the twelve trailing months (ttm) Operating Cash Flow was -78.78M. The cash flow has improved over the last quarters with higher revenues and gross margins. Next quarter revenues will likely come in at 28M+ and although its not spectacular growth compared to the last quarter (and Ouster stockprice has been punished for this guidance too much already) it is still 6M more year over year.But lets not forget that last year the gross margins were only at 14% as the company was working on synergies from the merger.They have done a great job at increasing the gross margins up to 34% and the goal is to get it even higher.So really the Q3 effect on the cash flow will be rather positive compared to last year and the ttm number will improve again.As Ouster keeps growing revenues and gross margins keep going higher (helped by software sales) analysts now predict they will be cash flow positive by the end of 2026.Hence the analyst pricetargets."

An important point here being that debt was not a factor in the company operating well below breakeven last quarter.\n\nAssuming the debt payment hits paper this quarter we are looking at a potential crisis as beaten down longs. Quite simply, if revenue remains relatively flat quarter-over-quarter cash flow will be beyond bad.\n\nRevenue is projected at 27-29m after coming in at 26.9m last quarter. So it’s really not looking great….\n\nAt this point I would expect a similar market reaction to last quarters earnings this quarter.\n\nCash flow is going to be a problem this quarter."

Most the group was ecstatic talking about being &#34;debt free&#34; moving forward and was very disappointed when I pointed out that while that may be true, the moves that were going to make this happen had not hit paper yet.You could hear a pin drop in the room as I added that free cash flow was -22m last quarter so this quarter could easily be another extremely rough one with the debt payment included this time around. Even more disturbing was that the cash flow was like this as debt increased quarter over quarter. We are operating below breakeven to say the least I&#39;m afraid.With cash presumably lower assuming little to no dilution it could get very, very ugly again after earnings if our quarter-to- quarter growth remains fairly stagnant. The group protested that we were &#34;all set&#34; because year-over-year growth remains strong , to which I responded, &#34;While that may be technically true, we are running out of quarters&#34;.A day of sad revelations indeed for Eric, bscoms, Kevin, Penny Stock Troll, Tam, me, Vartenis, and the old guard dog himself Smart Asset.We beaten down long and staying strong!

That - would help give some assurances to current shareholders that the management is not being flippant with ATM shares sold.As many of you know - I had a divergent view in Spring 2023, that OUST should have bought &#34;up to 5 million&#34; shares which would have only cost $20-25M back then (stock was in $4-5 range when I first brought this up). Oh, the raging responses of &#34;Cash is King&#34; etc. Well, as I argued - &#34;Takes Money to make Money&#34; overrides your theory, as does valuation data and OUST price went into oversold &gt;80RSI status in the $14-16 range. Ouster could have doubled their money, at minimum, if OUST buy-back shares at $5 sold at $10, and netted $25M at minimum, would have gained at least half the amount necessary to pay off debt and if sold at a higher amount, such as their ATM sales at $12-14 range, the entire debt could have been paid. Ouster management can do better."

Tesla does hold a market leading ADAS product in FSD, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s safe, and ADAS is not Full Autonomy. Sales vs accident rates aren&#39;t looking good for ADAS FSD, and will get worse as Tesla Robotaxi will also be problematic on the roadway. You gotta start doing more homework instead of spamming to understand the stratification of Autonomy levels vs ADAS. You should know this as a HSAI investor, unless you&#39;re merely trading HSAI to make a buck, but with all your &#34;love of China&#34; seeping into your posts, I would have thought you&#39;d be proud of HSAI also being ahead of TSLA for Autonomy certifications (courtesy of Ouster&#39;s tech, of course).Tesla has been a customer of both Luminar and Ouster to try and &#34;calibrate&#34; the optical sensors for Tesla to perform more toward the full capabilities of electro-optical LiDAR sensors. It&#39;s Elon&#39;s hope that he can manage to keep paying very little for cheap optical sensors so he doesn&#39;t have to commit the money for more expensive electro-optical sensors. Another flaw is that optical sensors degrade over time with clouding of lenses and/or covers much like headlight covers, whereas active laser pings still get through even when LiDAR covers get old. Elon Musk isn&#39;t always right, and he&#39;s especially wrong to try and leap into full autonomy with Tesla Robotaxi, unless he gives in and commits to a LiDAR multi-sensor array."

Would be good to review how much control that CEO Angus Pacala and his executive staff hold at this point, in % terms, since many ATM sales later, the stock has been diluted and the ATM sales have been at a greater pace/volume than Angus and the exec&#39;s have bought shares. Sure, we like to see them buy shares, but it&#39;s a pittance in contrast to ATM Sales of stock at this point. Who&#39;s in control at Ouster? Probably a good question at the next Earnings Call.While Austin Russell holds 70% control via LAZR B-shares, it&#39;s not as clear cut as to who holds sway over Ouster at the moment, and this sell-off does present opportunities for Ouster to lose control and be bought out - at a less favorable price, which is another angle that could be played here, by the nefarious actors that rummage the board. There was a group of Hedge Funds &#34;hired&#34; by someone, for some purpose, that helped drive down OUST over the last couple months. It&#39;s easy to tag HSAI with blame, and some measure of the pain is due to those great &#34;Americans&#34; over there in California and the Cayman Islands. There are probably other reasons why, Institutions going Long is a default."

These are only vetted Chinese who are near-guaranteed to uphold the CCP&#39;s best interests, no matter that they have educational credentials and/or work experience to do Green Card work in high tech, or at the low-end wage-earner as waitresses in the many Chinese restaurants/buffets owned and operated by the Chinese Triad (their mafia but with state ties/support so it&#39;s &#34;off the books&#34; operations by the CCP). These 10M are what by-definition will be, guaranteed, the &#34;Fifth Column&#34; (look up that term), should any war with China directly or by proxy, start in earnest. That 10M number does not include the many military-aged males we&#39;ve now seen flooding into Mexico and then crossing as an organized group in Southern California crossing points especially. Again - how does a Chinese citizen get permission to leave China and fly to Mexico on a 1-way flight? Those are also &#34;vetted&#34; Chinese but they will operate in the USA without the knowledge of the US government, so the even more nefarious actors are among them - just watch for more train derailments, and food processing plant fires, and even - so-called &#34;wildfires&#34; that are actually arson. Just a matter of when, not if, that the Fifth Column is activated."

It&#39;s actually concerning, though, because the Chinese stimulus money appears to be selectively flowing now. Look no further than HSAI, as example. They hit daily avg volume in only an hour of trading today.(Edit) btw, trading in HSAI in their first hour of the day, as the heaviest volume of the day, sends a clear signal that it&#39;s money from China, as that would be late in the day in Mainland China at the major cities with brokerage houses. Should be a pattern that gets noticeable if there is a steady diet of stimulus money being injected into Chinese stocks abroad (although any stock could get Chinese money, it&#39;s more likely to be aimed at pro-China companies, even if they&#39;re &#34;American.&#34;)."

So there&#39;s work on the part of Ouster and Genetec to convince those 42,500 customers to commit to add LiDAR sensors and the upgraded software, but it&#39;s a start. No other LiDAR company is talking Security Systems today. This is exactly where a company wants to be - a new market with little competition and a long list of customers to visit and sell to. There are a lot of &#34;Easy Win&#34; sales contracts that will come from this Genetec partnership."

In all your posts you have never given any useful information about why MVIS is a sound investment. You can only try to externally project because you&#39;re locked into a Loss on MVIS that will never recover. You&#39;ve had plenty of time to diversify your portfolio over the last several months. You could have joined in at UUUU as example, even though Puck and his many accounts tried to talk it down. That one is up over 25% because Uranium is a hot topic. LiDAR is a hot topic in the making as well. While Ouster doesn&#39;t need the help of the US Govt to succeed, the upcoming policy changes will certainly boost OUST and crush HSAI. That&#39;s one of the reasons the spammers are here - trying to drag OUST down before HSAI&#39;s day of judgement. Ouster does need to improve its own image and status, it&#39;s not perfect, but its flaws are fixable. The flaws in HSAI and MVIS hold permanence, and are mostly unrecoverable."

Nearly a year ago now, on the HSAI message board in Yahoo, Puck accidentally replied to an ongoing conversation with the wrong account, as if it were the same account carrying on the argument. He was essentially &#34;busted&#34; as a multi-account Yahoo spammer. Puck proceeded to go on a rant about how &#34;everyone does it&#34; and then went so far as to say that we Ouster investors with only a single Yahoo account weren&#39;t doing it right, weren&#39;t taking advantage of the system like he does, to use multiple accounts. For the few of us in that period of time, it was a watershed moment to see Puck for who he really is. Since then - Puck has tried to post wherever many of us pro-OUST accounts go externally - and immediately post to tell that message board that we have multiple accounts, and spam Yahoo boards, etc. Aside from that, Hesai has had problems due to their legal battle with OUST and the US Government. Puck just can&#39;t help himself, he has schizophrenia and is proud of it."

Anyone have a problem with that? What happens if each of Genetec&#39;s customers buy just one single Ouster sensor? Now do the math for an average of 5-10, or more. Ouster should hire Austin Russell to create an Order Book to resolve the sales potential here. And this is before we talk recurring revenue for Software sales/service over time, which is what really steadies Ouster&#39;s revenue stream as LiDAR becomes more a commodity over time."

We&#39;re past that now. Blue Skies? Not exactly, as there could be an October surprise (good or bad), but there&#39;s a purposeful push for our own US Fed to politically act (because they are political no matter how the media tries to spin otherwise) with the .5% Rate Cut now in the bag, more to follow, and now China injecting Stimulus money globally and cutting rates across the board also, especially long-term mortgages, and telling their Chinese citizens to essentially &#34;buy something, anything&#34; with freed up capital. It&#39;s like the Wild West on the Streets and Trading Floors today, and now through Election Day. The push is to try and make the US Economy look like geniuses are running the country right now. I don&#39;t think it will work (for the Election results the Fed and Xi want), but it will pay off with stock price increases."

There&#39;s a huge tug-of-war as our US Political system collides with Trillions of dollars from China. On one hand - the potential for high tariffs of goods from China, on the other hand imported cash from China isn&#39;t tariffed as it invests and buys foreign assets (to include US Assets, stocks, property, maybe even your child&#39;s soul). It&#39;s a Brave New World out there, with some people who have a &#34;Love of Money&#34; problem - suddenly embracing all things China, while others are wanting to put up a stronger hedge of protection against Chinese influence on our US economic and political systems.  If you haven&#39;t researched the Korean War before (which should have been called the First Chinese War instead, considering the numbers of Chinese fought against and killed in contrast to Koreans) -- when China entered that war it was a bit of a surprise that their hundreds of thousands of troops crossed over. That&#39;s what this is right now - the monetary equivalent of China entering that war."

Meaning, auto-stimulus injects can occur if any Chinese stock is sold into a particular percentage loss threshold (no details given on how they will actually monitor and manage this, it&#39;s more or less a Big Brother-has-your-back message to Chinese investors). Essentially, China has adopted a &#34;No Stock Left Behind&#34; policy, for their Public Companies at home and abroad.These and other initiatives were part of a formally published list (I&#39;ve not seen an organized list translated to English yet, of exactly what the Chinese Govt officials proposed, this is a summary from a US Financial expert). It is also possible that stocks such as LAZR see the benefit, because Chinese citizens could be invested in a company such as LAZR, and Geely Group and ECARX have a guy on the Luminar Board of Directors, and Luminar is potentially shifting high-rate production to China in the future (Chinese capital injected into LAZR could be seen as if &#34;incentive payments&#34; for Austin Russell to shift more toward Chinese dependency for Luminar).  Although Luminar is only a microcosm of what could now transpire on our markets, with winners vs losers based on how much pro/con the public company has for its competition and/or cooperation with China."

Case in point has been the California Minimum Wage shift that has elevated to $20/hour now. What many outside California don&#39;t realize, is that Silicon Valley pays a lot of money to lobby State Govt and the Governor to elevate wages, because a costly human is the best incentive to buy robots instead.If you want proof, search for this headline:Chipotle Starts Replacing Workers With Robots to Bypass California’s Minimum Wage LawsThere are at least a dozen articles out for this specific issue, and many other companies are going the same route. In the past, at lower Minimum Wage Levels, the cost of buying robots to work in fast food was prohibitive, but not now. Just be aware that Silicon Valley lobbies your own State Governments also (and Governors) to raise Minimum Wage across the entire USA (and this effort is going global).One could argue it&#39;s a Chicken vs Egg debate, but in Silicon Valley, the Golden Goose comes from government, to essentially push out low-wage workers while their tech companies get enriched with automation investments and purchases. I&#39;m a huge supporter of what Ouster is doing for Autonomy, but this is one area where California has laid a rotten egg."

Let&#39;s hear your actual Investing 101 argument in favor of Hesai. Would love to read it. I will even &#34;Sign Out&#34; to come back in and read your post (that&#39;s the technique to still seeing Muted accounts in Yahoo btw).My questions for you would be:How do you verify and have certainty that the Chinese production numbers for Hesai are even accurate, considering they are not audited?What was the real reason that the infamous former Hesai CFO resigned from his position?Even if Hesai continues to manufacture LiDAR Sensors in China, for Chinese-produced vehicles, how does Hesai overcome the low-margins sales to Chinese Auto OEMs?Why would HSAI actually be a good investment, even if one were pro-China as a Chinese Citizen? How does Hesai&#39;s past performance in low-margin Auto component sales add up to any future success, considering their market is getting limited and margins are shrinking?Why would the US Government not take action against Hesai at this point? How is Hesai innocent?Do you really believe that Hesai is guiltless from IP Theft and Patent Infringement for Ouster Technology? Hesai already pays for past violations to Velodyne, but do you think Hesai was innocent in that case also?If HSAI is removed/delisted from US Stock Market listing, will you still hold the stock?"

So then you shift to a new narrative as if you had forgotten about trying to criticize all my posts on other LiDAR boards, as if that was REALLY what brought you here, but you conveniently forgot to criticize me first thing, after making this new account 8 hours ago. So if I really motivated you to create your account and come into OUST and post here, you waited over 8 hours and a few posts into your Yahoo existence to say so?You&#39;re not even a good liar. How many shares of HSAI do you own? Do you work for HSAI?"

The year-on-year growth that we saw these last quarters was organic growth, not the effect of adding Velodyne customers.The Gemini deals mentioned in the lates ER&#39;s are very significant and regularly we see proof of existing customers scaling up. The Serve announcement of putting 2000 robots on the streets in the next year was just huge.No new business is profitable from the start. Especially for lidar It takes a lot of money to develop new products. Just setting up the whole organisation and worldwide network also takes time.The adoption of lidar has been slower than hoped, but Ouster now sees strong growth in all verticals. Your suggestion that there is no yoy growth is just false.The yoy growth is within the financial framework, on a path to profitability, that was presented in the Q3&#39;23ER (30-50% yoy growth, 35-40% gross margins, OPEX at or below Q3&#39;23).The fear of running out of money is unjust with about 90m needed as operating cash flow (OCF).With gross margins at 35-40% and revenues above 150m in 2025 they will only draw down the cash on hand by less than 40m even without any ATM sales. There is enough cash on hand to make it to OCF possitive and then to profitability.Fully paying off the debt shows the CFO is very confident about the cash position.Ofcourse Ouster would have options for more funding if they wish.If anything this would be a good time to invest in Ouster as the difficult years are behind us."

We probably won&#39;t see any updated Price Target from these firms until after Q3&#39;s Earnings Report is released.Institutional Ownership inflow vs outflow. Inflow over the last 12 months was 37 Institutional Buyers amounting to $34.2M of stock, with Outflows of only 9 Institutions at $1.76M of stock. If you factor this in vs outflow as a ratio, OUST is among the best stocks for Institutional inflow over the outflow. Interestingly, some of the more recent Institutions buying OUST include Pension plans, who invest for long term.Ouster paid off all their debt in August of this year, and is one of only two LiDAR companies among the dozen that I track, that are debt-free.Book Value per Share sat at 3.62 before the debt payoff.Short Sales stock count was 6M and could have gone to 7M. While this may not seem like a &#34;Value&#34; statistic, those Short-Sellers will eventually cover, amounting to upward pressure on the stock just like any other Buy. If all those shorted shares were to cover, that is worth at least $2 or more of share value."

The alternative strategy pursued by most in the sector of going straight to the shiny object of ADAS has proven a failure.Strategy is nothing without execution and Ouster&#39;s huge number of customers is clear evidence of execution of the strategy. In the hundreds if I&#39;m not mistaken.Put together the hundreds of customers with the potential to scale in each vertical and you have the formula for truly massive potential revenues.I came to this board a little over a year ago drawn by some excellent posts that addressed real content..ie engineering, company strategy, real numbers and more.  I&#39;ve not seen any posts that reveal anything that would dissuade me from remaining long.  Granted, I have many posters on ignore but I only do that after multiple non-content posts.M thought as to why Ouster has not yet been discovered include the fact that LiDAR itself is still relatively unknown and the use cases even more so.  I do an unscientific poll by asking people if they are aware of or know anything about LiDAR and the responses tell me the technology is not yet pervasive.  Understandable that the company is another level deep wrt recognition(share price).Unless something changes I will continue to add."

He claimed that Quanergy would have &#34;zero&#34; range distance, something that Ouster only recently achieved in the OS Family btw. My understanding is that Angus Pacala was doing line engineer work and helping advance their tech, while the CEO was failing them all. Probably became some motivation for Angus to start his own company with Mark Frichtl and distance themselves from such individuals being CEO."

Ouster pursued all the Verticals or sectors outside of the Auto Industry primarily, in ramping up sensor development and with their R&amp;D focus over the years. Ouster applied most resources toward what is now the OS Family of Sensors - not Auto OEM grade/sized, but more of a universal option to put LiDAR on as many different platforms as possible. The OS Family is in the Auto Industry, as post-OEM mods such as panel vans, buses, and semi-trucks.The OS Family opened up a wider variety of Use Cases for customers to develop next-gen solutions, and is why Ouster now has hundreds of customers that have experimented with the OS Family.Amazon uses this same approach, and helps explain why Ouster gets great Margins for their sales (up in the 40% Gross Margin range), because Amazon uses Proteus robots in the warehouse to offset personnel costs. In any business, normally the largest cost driver are the personnel costs. This affects the Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS, an acronym to remember). Amazon will gladly pay a premium for an Ouster sensor, to reduce personnel costs. Whereas a fickle Retail Consumer shopping for an Automobile, may not want to use their limited funds to buy an expensive LiDAR add-on option. In addition, the Auto Industry itself is fickle as to what vendors they buy car parts from (just check how your car stereo speakers change year after year, as one example).Ouster is succeeding because it helps lower COGS in multiple industries."

This exact point of Y-over-Y vs Q-over-Q was stressed at the last earnings call btw, and the CFO was clear that regardless there only being 4% Q-over-Q there would still be a 30-50% Y-over-Y Annual Growth rate.

Hence the negative reaction after the ER.I think it&#39;s likely revenues will make a jump again around the start of the new year as it has done so in the last few years too.Management has been very clear that they see growth in every vertical and that they expect Ouster revenues to grow within that financial framework in 2025 and in the years after.That growth combined with the 35 to 40% gross margins, and OPEX at or below Q3&#39;23 will get Ouster to profitability while maintaining a healthy balance sheet."

It&#39;s pretty obvious that the start point was around the Q1 report where they beat the estimates by $0.19.. Ok that makes good sense and it puts a data-point down for current growth rate and expected growth rate.Aug - beat by $0.09 - pushed SERV order - paid 40M in debtIs it fair to believe the growth rate and expected growth rate numbers from previous quarter are still intact with the explanations given above?I think the only real answer to that question will come in the next report....  but you don&#39;t get to count the pushed SERV $, because it has to be applied to Q2 to keep the growth slope intact..  I&#39;m not sure exactly how to bring the debt paydown into that same graphic, but it does apply (in a positive sense).Q&#39;s:1) If the SERV order had not been pushed is there any way to know how much impact that would have had on the &#34;beat by&#34; #?  (use all 2,000) 2) for the $40M.. same question and we have data for this one..  The way to get the firms interested again I would think has to be prove that you have and continue to maintain the same growth rate that attracted them in the first place..  thoughts?"

It operates at a 1550nm wavelength which works better for longer distance because of the longer wavelength.As for disadvantages: Those lasers are significantly more expensive. Rain and fog degrade that wavelength 4 to 5 times more than the 905nm wavelength. It is 95% worse in snow. It also consumes about 10 times more power and generates more heat.FMCW LiDAR signal is also analog so it needs to be converted to digital whereas Ouster&#39;s LiDAR comes out of the sensor as a digital signal. Ouster&#39;s signal needs the computer to compute for velocity but FMCW&#39;s instantaneous velocity signal needs to be converted from analog to digital. As computation speed increases whatever advantage FMCW has becomes smaller and smaller but the disadvantages remain the same.Mobileye was working on FMCW LiDAR but recently announced they had quit development of it apparently deciding the disadvantages outweighed the advantages."

It was a reality check for the upcoming Reverse Split that some hoped to avoid. Worse than the RS - the Equity Offer is in writing also at this point, for 800 Million Shares (which is questionable whether that remains as-is or is factored down with RS). Even if the RS shrinks that, it&#39;s still heavy dilution coming to current LAZR shareholders, combined with post-RS shorting of the stock that always happens. Looks like LAZR will be headed below that 60 cent Fair Value level that I mentioned previously. There&#39;s a growing list of regrets over at the LAZR board now, although Atul is now the lead hypemaster in hopes of LAZR turnaround."

I&#39;d like to see INDI and OUST form a partnership where OUST makes the sensors that INDI puts into their going systems. What INDI primarily develops and manufactures - dashboard electronics to include many modern car dashes that have Google Autoplay and Apple&#39;s auto systems as well. You&#39;ve probably used INDI products before, and didn&#39;t know it (their brand doesn&#39;t appear on the &#34;stereo&#34; on the dash), especially if you&#39;ve rented a newer vehicle.  INDI hit their 52-week low recently, and I was waiting for signs of a reversal and I&#39;m not certain it has reversed yet but anything below $4 should be a &#34;safe&#34; Entry Point for INDI. Not advertising for the stock, just making sure Ouster investors put INDI on your radar because what they&#39;re doing has high potential to look for outsourcing of the LiDAR sensors as Ouster comes to market with the new upgraded DF Sensor. If INDI were to shut down in-house development of LiDAR, to favor outsourcing, it&#39;s a big deal as to who they would buy LiDAR from (they&#39;re already embedded with Auto OEMs btw)."

The company appears in a death spiral, stock was down 30% today to 31 Cents, and Delisting notices already went out a month ago. Appears inevitable to go into bankruptcy and/or Reverse Split (and RS may only delay the Bankruptcy). They filed for a convertible loan and the market isn&#39;t keen on their plan. You can pretty much write off LDTC as a LiDAR company at this point, if not also writing them off completely as any kind of company. All prior discussion amounted to no IP of significance worth saving from LDTC, not worth buying out either, as their inferior LiDAR IP is already gone. To this point, no evidence that their software holds potential. I have already removed LDTC from my &#34;LiDAR Industry&#34; stock tracker. I only track 11 LiDAR stocks now."

My take - Robosense investors/institutions backing them, think they&#39;re ok since they aren&#39;t primarily in Smart Infrastructure for their LiDAR sensor sales. Hesai is mysteriously up today also, in the face of the news, although only 1/4 normal volume.What the Chinese Investors/backers of Robosense and Hesai may not realize, is that this is merely the first of many legislative actions put toward Chinese LiDAR, and more restrictions are still being crafted in DC that will ultimately deny any/all Chinese produced LiDAR from US sales (possibly all Western nations as well). It&#39;s just the &#34;first shot across the bough&#34; and many more volleys will be fired in the future. Are we at war with China? No, not yet, but we are starting to see our Federal Congress/Legislature start to act like we need to have more preparedness in the face of possible future wars."

Radio Silence, and even the news rags that post in Yahoo aren&#39;t releasing a story - not even an AI-generated story, on Luminar&#39;s pending Reverse Split. I&#39;ve checked Dow brokerage news feeds also, that push news to brokerage houses - same thing, not a single mention of Reverse Split proxy filed by Luminar.

Velodyne had nothing to do with the OS-Family, as the OS-Family&#39;s R&amp;D and production were going before the Velo merger was even considered. As for next-gen DF Sensor, the bulk of that Tech/IP knowledge actually came from Ouster&#39;s well-timed acquisition of Sense Photonics, as they were starting in on LiDAR-on-a-chip tech when Ouster chose to buy them out.Velo&#39;s actual tech is now Legacy, although still helping inform the future, their product lines are phasing out.

I will be blunt - I probably rent as many cars as anyone here on the board, and all the modern vehicles across all price levels with ADAS - are horrid. First thing you do in a new rental - turn off all that ADAS garbage. The &#34;ride experience&#34; is basically an attempt to bring video game controller &#34;shakes&#34; of the steering wheel into the driver&#39;s steering wheel. If you change a lane on the highway without using the turn signal - ADAS vibrates your steering wheel, and in some cases it tries to steer against you, then causing reaction/over-reaction as you fight the wheel. Some brands&#39; ADAS are worse than others (worse - I say, because none are &#34;good&#34; and all have enormous flaws). The dashboard electronics are failing also - try to connect with Google or Apple play, and many vehicles have &#34;Error&#34; messages for the dashboard hardware not having the latest software. This is a trending thing for rental car companies btw - having vehicles with electronics that fail their customers, and &#34;Fleet Vehicles&#34; are being requested to come without a lot of this stuff installed on it, but we will see how Auto OEMs respond. So, no - ADAS isn&#39;t the answer, it&#39;s a failing tool in the auto industry at the moment because of nanny-like actions the car takes against the driver."

No significant news that provides clarity as to why.Hesai is only 28 cents off their 52-week Low (and may be all-time low as well).INVZ is being held above 50 cents by some institution(s) but that could break and there may be capitulation as LAZR also sells off. When INVZ is forced to either delist or perform a Reverse Split, the RS is expected to be their choice.INDI makes dashboard components that bring in Apple and Google connectivity for vehicles, but also have a system with their own LiDAR (a lesser product in their portfolio). INDI has potential to discontinue in-house LiDAR and choose a more capable vendor. INDI has traded at their All-time Low due to concerns for RIF of personnel and revenue backlog isn&#39;t as strong as expected.AEVA is only 19 cents off their 52-week low. No significant news, so the stock is drifting with the negative sentiment.LIDR was headed for $1.00 but has been propped up at $1.10 for now. The Pump-and-Dump schemes have ceased for now.The surprise for Tuesday was MVIS getting a Meme rally to put the stock over $1CPTN still waiting for acquisition to complete, dead money."

And then there&#39;s the US Government - US Dept of Transportation and their SMART program giving grants for many one-off experiments that have LiDAR installations, with Ouster being the vendor for most of those with LiDAR requirements, and any of those could transition into full deployments after the experiments are proven out, and the government always over-pays for anything related to roads (and most Road Construction contracts are always &#34;local companies&#34; for political reasons, as reminder, as politicians bring home the bacon, I mean pork). NVIDIA is more than a partner, in contrast to other LiDAR companies that all say NVIDIA works with them - for bench-testing hardware to ensure both NVIDIA hardware and LiDAR hardware function together, but Ouster has something more than their peers - NVIDIA CEO appeared at a demonstration event with NVIDIA manufactured robots, and they had Ouster LiDAR sensors on them, meaning that NVIDIA expanding into robotics would more likely buy from OUST as a true customer, and not merely a partnership. Long list of Trucking/logistics companies modding vehicles for automated hauling, from the &#34;last mile&#34; deliveries that are simple, to long-hauls mostly between two points just off highways."

Ouster appears unwilling to use the big names of the companies they sell to as a marketing tool.There was the news of collaboration with Bosch in development of a promising use case with Ouster sensors on factory walls guiding electric cars through the factory on their own.There was management&#39;s discussion of the two biggest mapping companies in the world with Billions of customers utilizing Ouster. No names mentioned but the only two I know that have billions of regular customers are Google and Apple. I&#39;m happy to say the names even if they are unwilling.Those are my favorites but it is just the tip of the iceberg as many new young companies are utilizing Ouster and any one of them might be the next huge name in industry. See Serve robotics as a fine example of one getting lots of positive attention recently.Then you can get into the many expanding opportunities with Gemini and Blue City for smart monitoring of infrastructure and traffic. The big names there are actually States like Utah and companies that monitor airports. That vertical is just starting to take off.Ouster probably won&#39;t ever use the big names as marketing the way others do and the proof will hopefully be in the quarterly revenue."

My hope is that it&#39;s a US company...either Ford or GM would be just fine.  An ADAS rollout could well be dovetailed to some city infrastructure LiDAR as well.  Lots of possibilities.If indeed this is a forerunner of an ADAS sensor I would hope Ouster has some software to go along with it."

The market loves pumping preprofit growth companies up above fair value and then beating them down below fair value. Nobody really knows for sure where it is going right now of course. I know where things are going when the interest rate cut news hits though. Ouster knows too. It was smart that they paid off loans when they did even if the market punished them for it. They are in prime position for when things turn the corner. If the DF sensor is everything we hope then even better"

China could put pressure on companies competing with Chinese corporations, or could influence the capital injected into foreign markets.Long-term goal for China is to take all of their 145 separate brokerages and only have 3 remaining in forcible consolidation by 2035. This one is the largest, and is clearly one of the final 3 that will remain.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-merges-two-brokerages-create-153218025.html"

If you hadn&#39;t read the complete news release before, see the article titled &#34;How 3D lidar is propelling yard and dock logistics towards safer, more efficient operations&#34; but here&#39;s a caveat that may not jump out at you initially.ITK Engineering in Germany is behind this development and sales, where Ouster sensors are part of their packaged deals. Ouster&#39;s Gemini software also gets packaged into the deal.Why ITK Engineering in itself is the gold nugget - it&#39;s a fully-owned subsidiary of Bosch. Why that matters - Bosch made a conscious decision a year ago, to discontinue in-house development of LiDAR sensors. Remember that news? At the time, it was hinted at that Ouster could get Bosch&#39;s business for Auto OEM sales, but that&#39;s a follow-on discussion at this point. The bigger story is that ITK Engineering is a major artery for sales into European industry, in many forms, and that means Ouster has a going relationship with a major Component manufacturer that has chosen their product AND software for ongoing development.Don&#39;t underwhelm this news, when you put 1+1 together - what are the implications for Bosch developing Auto OEM components, once Ouster&#39;s DF Sensor is market-ready? And DF Sensor could become a new subcomponent in ITK Engineering&#39;s industrial build-outs, aside from OS Family retaining status there as well. We got Bosch. Will Bosch buy OUST?"

Translated - FSD&#39;s optical sensors are inferior and less safe than LiDAR equipped vehicles. Too bad that plain language doesn&#39;t hit the news, as the general public needs to learn the tech differences in Optical vs Electro-Optical sensors - especially if they will risk their lives on the road by taking their hands off the steering wheel and letting the car drive itself. Although there&#39;s a tinge of political opposition due to Elon Musk, it&#39;s also about the risks of allowing an unproven technology to literally &#34;run free&#34; on public roadways. Sadly, we will see more accidents and deaths due to Tesla FSD, that will become better than paid advertisements for LiDAR."

Another source says a Fed Reserve insider has warned that they may face data that signals &#34;Recession&#39; and then blame would be aimed at the Fed for acting too slowly - with a hint that we could see a Rate Cut triggered to as deep as 1 Basis Point (1%). What I take from reading this and other recent Fed related articles - we are about to see history repeat itself from the Carter-to-Reagan economic shift period, where the Fed would do rapid cuts and even increases as the economy gyrated, with cuts being 1% moves and not just the small 1/4% ones we&#39;ve become more accustomed to in the modern day. Regardless, if Data signals &#34;Recession&#39;&#34; then all bets are off, because if we start seeing Recession in the news going into Election Day, things could go crazy. Anyone want a repeat of 2008-9 crisis?"

Luminar was probably dinged from this announcement. Volvo will no longer follow the complete transition to EVs by 2030, and expects to retain Hybrids in their product mix (and we could see a further revision to retain gas and/or diesel models). None of this matters for Ouster, because their entry to Auto OEM amd ADAS will not see favorable business from the Geely Group, as Geely has tentacles in Luminar&#39;s Board of Directors. It&#39;s a long shot for Ouster or any other western LiDAR company, to earn Geely&#39;s business. What we are really seeing with Geely Volvo vs old Swedish Volvo, is a move toward what the market thinks. Old Swedish Volvo didn&#39;t think and operate this way. They took pride in achieving the pinnacle of safety and reliability. That old Volvo is now gone, never to return again. That&#39;s the real story of the day in the Auto Industry."

Why are you complaining if you&#39;re Long the stock? Are you trying to sell the stock in the next month? The next quarter?

This latest decision comes as result of coordination between NY and the State Dept, but signals yet more arrests and/or purges of Chinese agents and officials could be coming to a state near you.There is a growing anti-China sentiment in DC and many states now, and this only lends more support to ongoing efforts to take action against Hesai and similar companies that are forward-based operations of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).And here&#39;s a familiar story - the arrested Chinese Agent was receiving the bribes/payoff money via her spouse. We&#39;ve seen a lot of govt officials&#39; and politicians&#39; spouses achieve significant wealth in the last couple decades. And we wonder why so many factories in the USA closed and outsourced production from China - often with the closed US factories&#39; tooling and assembly lines packed up and shipped to China.The MO of this arrested Chinese Agent - to block any meetings requested by representatives of Taiwan, who sought an audience with NY Officials (to include the Governor)."

Many of those will be repeat customers and some will scale up.  My guess is that infrastructure(Smart Grant $500mil) will scale up prior to robotics even though Serv has begun it&#39;s build out.  It could be that the military will be first to scale up and that&#39;s likely considered robotics so there&#39;s that.Security is an additional vertical.  I see some overlap there with infrastructure.  ADAS is not yet ramping and until our new chip and form factor reduction are out it probably won&#39;t happen wrt revenues.  An ADAS contract and announcement however are not out of the question.  2026 is the likely year for ADAS level 3 and above so our existing verticals will tide us over.I&#39;m not in a hurry and already have a significant position."

This isn&#39;t Capitulation Day, yet, for INVZ, but when it happens, you will likely see any Institutions holding the stock heading for the exits at whatever price they can get, and the stock potentially cuts in half. Could create negativity in short term for LiDAR stocks in general, depending how it plays out (expect propaganda news stories on the &#34;failure of LiDAR to deliver&#34; as a technology, or such).AEye (LIDR) has lost all their prior Pump-and-Dump schemers, volume totally dried up, and the stock is faltering again towards $1.00 but a reminder, LIDR just had a Reverse Split in the past year so there&#39;s no room for another RS to save themselves. The desperation at corporate level was clearly shown when the LIDR CEO started racing off to China to try and sell something/anything to China (bad decision). Considering the US Government efforts to consider restrictions on Chinese LiDAR, he made a bad choice.AEVA on their second straight selloff day, was down 16% yesterday after one of the founders/insiders sold some of their position off, but the stock is thinly traded so news like that spiked it downward.Hesai is down again, and Robosense traded off their all-time low yesterday. This appears a clear hint that even the Chinese market is nervous about their business in the Western world."

When he accidentally made a counterpoint from a different Yahoo account, which personalized his response in a way that showed it was clearly the same dude responding using a different Yahoo account - Puck admitted in a reply that he used multiple Yahoo accounts, then went on an &#34;everybody does it&#34; excuse rant as if we weren&#39;t playing by his normal rules of multi-account aliasing here in Yahoo. We basically &#34;outed&#34; Puck as a multi-account spammer trying to boost HSAI and it really made me wonder if he&#39;s incentivized to do this on multiple platforms (and multi-acct hyping for HSAI with compensation). This is one of the main reasons that Puck and his gang are here (some are aliases, some are probably aligned or in his same Boiler Room operations). And he constantly accuses all of us in OUST as if we&#39;re the ones with multiple aliases, because he&#39;s also a trained Saul Alinsky type - front-loads accusations of what he is doing wrong, aimed at the other guy, to immediately deflect any potential blame going his way (a multi-acct spammer tries to legitimize his primary acct to the audience with false accusations of opponents as if they&#39;re the ones - who multi-acct spam). Just prepare yourself, because we&#39;re going to have an army of Puck clones the more that we allow Chinese influence into our country."

If you have a cogent analysis that indicates why Hsai is the better company then give it. Yes their sales are larger, but they are still losing a lot of money every quarter. It seems kinda a toss up to me. And they do have some legal issues.  That&#39;s a fact."

We could see a complete Institutional selloff of INVZ in the near future, and it would be a negative day for LiDAR in general (buying opportunity for OUST, when it happens).An insider of AEVA sold a small amount of their position, and the stock tanked 16%.Robosense is trading right now in Hong Kong at its all-time low as well, bouncing off that price tonight. Robosense has a &#34;guilt by association&#34; aspect with Hesai&#39;s ongoing problems. Simultaneously Hesai has been weakened by all the political pressure from the US Government now compounding its existing problems, to include lingering questions as to why the Hesai CFO resigned (he was already investigated by the SEC previously, already resigned from a Chinese solar scam company in the past also). Is Hesai double/triple counting sensors produced and putting them back on the shelf? That was one of the accounting tricks of the past.As for Broad Market, there&#39;s a Dark Cloud out there, that is lingering and it could be something unexpected.

Those extreme measures - have resulted in lots of angry Chinamen and their invested partners in the USA (maybe NY Gov Hochul&#39;s Chinese Agent, just arrested, was one of them).In other news, it was great to see the movie &#34;Reagan&#34; tonight - highly recommend going to the theater and seeing that movie, with a great backstory about our nation&#39;s continual war against Communism and the attempts to destroy us from within.  This Hesai process shows that this same war against Communism faces a Maoist problem as well."

That&#39;s 6.27 people in an ambulance to the emergency room every single minute. In the same time frame, the American economy has lost over $120 billion each year due to traffic with drivers spending an average of 97 hours in congestion annually. That&#39;s over 3 days, per driver, of lost time, each year. With accurate safety and traffic analytics that inform actionable changes from city and traffic planners these problems are solvable. Vision Zero is within reach and we&#39;re taking significant steps to make it a reality. \n\nWill be buying more when market correction has passed.\n\nand so far, congrats short! what a ride.."

In the normal Operating cost areas, Ouster&#39;s losses are coming down in every key line item that matters. The CEO and CFO have done a good job at cost cutting and it&#39;s not that difficult to compare the last 4x 10-Q/K and see the Q-over-Q reduction in costs. What skews the reports are the write-downs/offs from the Velodyne acquisition, and then there are Legal Fees accruing because your favorite Chinamen at Hesai want to steal Ouster&#39;s IP and infringe on their Patents, so Ouster must pay large legal costs to protect their IP. If Ouster did not have this Chinese problem at their doorstep (and possibly on the inside, for all we know) -- there&#39;d be a lot less &#34;loss&#34; each quarter, so I do blame some of the losses on the other side. You don&#39;t want to talk about these &#34;eaches&#34; line item entries though, right? You&#39;d rather generalize that the losses look worse each quarter, when in fact, if you remove the items that aren&#39;t recurring nor normal business, Ouster looks like it is tightening its belt and preparing to be a significant tech  firm that can meet high-production demands in the future.For one thing, try and name all the LiDAR companies that have zero debt on their books now. Ouster is one. Maybe MVIS also is debt free, but that&#39;s a special case of selling stock for 30 years as a commodity to keep their cash levels high."

I pay attention to the posts here, and some of you may have missed it at the time - one of Rola&#39;s last posts here on the OUST board, that was either deleted by him or removed by Yahoo - stated that there was anger at UBS for Ouster recently paying off their $42M debt in August, a Line of Credit that had been put in place as a refinancing deal, about 6 month ago (replaced a prior Loan Shark deal with horrible rates). This UBS deal came with a catch - OUST had to put up over $50M in Restricted Cash to hold the Line of Credit with UBS. Considering that UBS had over $1M per quarter in Interest payments going to them, and that the Restricted Cash deposit over $50M had to be freed up back to OUST, the comment by Rola has merit. As many here know, Rola often gave what was borderline Inside Information on this board, like he practically knew Ouster&#39;s legal counsel.UBS can be ruthless, especially the Swiss headquarters (they have secondary headquarters in Germany btw. While I often default to criticism of Hesai, who always has an axe to grind here, I think Rola probably had the best insight as to how we ended up here. He stated that UBS wanted to make back their perceived loss of future revenue from OUST.Just be mindful that companies like UBS use external Hedge Funds like hired hands."

The collective and coordinated hedge fund shorting of OUST comes with the fact that other professional Institutions won&#39;t fight against their coordinated decline of the stock, but instead wait for a clear bottom and reversal before buying back in. Professionals don&#39;t catch the falling knife, they pile on as the trend reverses and momentum sets in. Otherwise it would be Institutions vs Hedge Funds and they would rather be mutually beneficial than battle each other. Would be different if Ouster is being groomed for sale in an acquisition but in this case it appears as something else. Let&#39;s also not forget that Ouster may have made an enemy in UBS when they paid off their entire Credit line of over $42M, not just because of no interest payments, but UBS had to unleash the Restricted Cash of $52M held in reserve for Ouster&#39;s former Credit Line. Someone at UBS was angry about the payoff. Don&#39;t put it past UBS to be the one that hired Hedge Funds to earn back their &#34;lost money&#34; on a coordinated Short trade."

INVZ is dragging everyone down - it hit all-time low 60 cents today, likely Capitulation Day next week, and estimates are that if INVZ drops below 60 cents, most all Institutions will sell all their shares off and the stock will cut in half to 30 cents. That - is a bad trading day for LiDAR, but it will be a great day when INVZ is no longer siphoning off Capitol dollars that could have gone to a better LiDAR company (such as Ouster). You will start to see the Clowns of LiDAR topple, one at a time, some to not just get Delisted and/or Reverse Split, but to bankrupt and permanently shut down.

A stock buyback might be similarly misunderstood as their not knowing how to spend the money on growth so they are buying back stock instead.If a buyback were to be announced they would need to  make an extra effort to be clear that it is because they feel the stock is very undervalued and they are confident that they have enough of a cushion to reach profitablity and sustain growth with less cash on hand."

This is especially true if the company had a long period of using stock-based compensation in formative years and moving toward profitability there is enough cash to buy them back. Same is true for countering the dilution of prior equity offers or ATM sales of shares.Increases the Earnings-per-share metrics. Fewer Shares Outstanding means EPS calculations become more favorable for quarterly and annual reports, influencing stock analysts who center on the EPS performance.A way to return capital to shareholders, with limited taxation. Often an overlooked aspect of stock buybacks, but shareholders that experience an increased share price are not yet taxed, whereas if the company paid a dividend instead, that would have been taxed.The company finds their stock undervalued. Management knows if the company will meet expectations, yet if the stock price does not reflect either their past performance metrics (P/S and/or P/E), and is not fairly valued for known future performance (PEG), a company would wisely buy back its own shares in anticipation of meeting or exceeding performance that near-guarantees the company buys back shares at a price lower than what it should trade toward later."

Any Institution can pull up the TTM Revenue, sort out where they would put the Mark for Fair Value at their P/S Ratio (and many would choose P/S 5), and AI/Algorithms could be put on mission to trade toward that Fair Value range also. Point is - Shorts don&#39;t have the Data backing up their positions right now, and at any time a momentum play could begin that wipes them out of most gains. Long holders of the stock, and anyone buying in at these levels, this is an area where it&#39;s a &#34;Safe&#34; Entry Point into OUST."

It&#39;s a positive thing but brokerage house newsfeeds don&#39;t even receive Zacks stories anymore, for the respectable brokerage houses, anyways.Edit for Daniel - I didn&#39;t say Zacks themselves rated OUST a Strong Buy, I said the article reinforces a Strong Buy - because it does. The top half of the article is all about the ABR and at 1.80 for current Analysts, that equals &#34;Strong Buy&#34; - look at the graph up top showing 3 of 5 Analysts have OUST at Strong Buy (weighted balance = Strong Buy), then Zacks in their automated garbage form goes on to counter that analysis and says Zacks has a &#34;Sell&#34; themselves, because of changing future forecasts. This is why Zacks is a rag of an automated source, because they&#39;ve lazily automated their articles to the point they are contradictory. I will trust the Analyst data up front more than Zacks ethereal musings at the end of the article."

Anyone not in the sales transaction - we&#39;re just guessing, but we don&#39;t know yet how that breaks down on that agreement. Probably a good question for Ouster CEO in a future earnings call, or the CFO - to explain how software is baked into the sale, whether it&#39;s tacked onto each sensor, or it&#39;s flat fee on a separate line, but it&#39;s an extra cost either way.And one other unknown - let&#39;s say a sensor was sold in a prior quarter and as result the sensor sale revenue already accounted for in a prior published 10-Q, but some recurring payment/fee is due for software, that will clearly have to be its own line in the future but we don&#39;t know if Ouster will separate out their sales as they lay out revenue in the 10-Q (would be helpful to see the residual revenue generated for software from past sensor sales, as a separate line item).Last, I&#39;d defer to a lawyer for the License vs Fee discussion, but you could sell a license up front, then charge a fee/subscription to retain the License after an expiration date (typically 1 year, I would guess). So then there&#39;s separate lines of accounting for License (initial cost) vs Fee (recurring)."

This is a big deal, because large-scale military equipment going autonomous and having Ouster &#34;on board the program&#34; will really propel Ouster&#39;s name brand to the masses and make it a household name/brand.

Sure, it gives a CEO at an Earnings Call a way to parse out a 4-slice pie for Analysts who often don&#39;t want diatribe or details, but in reality - LiDAR is so new to the commercial side (even though 20 yrs old for Commercial and 60+ years old for military/NASA, but I digress) - regardless, LiDAR is still so new to most people, that it must be explained like Steve Jobs used to do with early tech talks he held.There are over 20 different NAICS coded Industries that Ouster sells into, and Auto Parts is only one of them. Recommend you look at the way NAICS codes lay out, and SEC SIC codes (OUST files per its SIC code btw), although among all LiDAR centric companies, there&#39;s at least 4-5 different SEC SIC codes being used (no consistency, leading to confusion). Since there is technically not a &#34;LiDAR Industry&#34; as a NAICS code nor SEC SIC code, it&#39;s just a slang term for now and not official. Same is true for Smart Infrastructure - that&#39;s not a NAICS or SEC SIC coded thing, it&#39;s just made-up. Back to Steve Jobs - you can make things up, even silly names like &#34;iPhone&#34; and &#34;smartphone&#34; but you must explain to the public what these terms mean. I don&#39;t mind Angus trying to get organized, but at the same time - he needs to know when to channel Steve Jobs and talk about all 20+ NAICS industries that OUST sells to, and not hold back."

And if you make a compelling argument as you just did, and about a dozen responses occurred in total that argued your position effectively, then see what happens? The Original Post at the top was Deleted, so all of those dozen posts go away once a top-level post is deleted. These are the type of people we are dealing with - it&#39;s like the old Boiler Rooms of the past, except they&#39;ve gone virtual. In some cases, more than one person logs into each account. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the &#34;Puck&#34; account has had at least 2-3 different people log into it. That&#39;s how a virtual Boiler Room works btw, they share accounts, make multiple accounts to give the appearances as if many people agree with and are like-minded for their arguments, etc. Then they accuse us as if we&#39;re the ones with aliases, as if I have multiple accounts, which I don&#39;t - this is my single Yahoo account for nearly 30 years running now.Any Impersonation post - use that 3-dot button to the right of the post, &#34;Report&#34; it, select the &#34;Profile&#34; option for the type of Report, and type out details of Impersonation and recommend Yahoo ban the account permanently."

The fact that they planned for this much computing requirement instead of finding some creative solution to integrate inside a single computer/GPU setup, shows that Luminar as a company is not ready for Primetime. They simply failed at the integration task, no matter the quality of their LiDAR sensor. Consider the additional power requirements for having all of these separate computing devices - draining electrical power from an EV and/or Hybrid, causing more heat than necessary that must be planned for in design work to ensure that heat is dissipated enough for each and every computing device to not exceed operating limits and continue to function (again, instead of one single computing device more easily planned for in terms of installation and heat dissipation). This smacks of a level of incompetence that is just flat out unacceptable for Auto OEMs to take Luminar seriously. This level of detail that I&#39;m listing here - this is enough of a &#34;foul&#34; on the part of Luminar, for some Auto OEMs to blacklist Luminar and never work with them."

The ADAS will be fully functional in 2025.The software will gather info on aberrant events the driver/car experience, send it to Volvo, who then incorporates them into the reprogrammed software sent back to the owner.  The self-driving will then be integrated/upgraded.This method is opposed to Waymo or Cruise which gather data with their respective taxi services.Great strategy in my book."

My Fair Value analysis didn&#39;t change to spike a fake number up toward $16, it has always stayed TTM P/S 5 until I elevated to P/S 7 because OUST now has a proven record of Year-over-Year revenue growth and remains committed to 30-50% Annual (not quarterly) Revenue growth. The Serve Robotics order of 2,000 sensors only reinforces Fair Value to P/S 7 mark at this point.Don&#39;t fight the math, and stop trying to play revisionist historian."

It&#39;s also been a trend for Boiler Room type operations to carry out pump-and-dump for LIDR and other thin stocks, and some of those firms put Ouster on radar because of the competition.  If anything - it&#39;s Ouster&#39;s success that has made it a target, because they are expected to stay solid with 10-Qs going forward and these swings are being ridden by the pros and at the expense of retailers with cold feet.Just watch the Percentage change in reporting for the amount of OUST Shares held by Institutions vs Retail Investors. That&#39;s the key metric to track right now, and no matter the growth in Shorted shares, the number of Long shares held by Institutions is going up, so those Institutions have Hedge Funds helping them get a Sale Price to enter the stock. It&#39;s simply the way some Institutions &#34;Buy Low&#34; - at the expense of ignorant or ill-informed Retail Investors/traders."

It will take time for dust to settle and I would tend to agree this time with &#34;4 AM stocks&#34; that ouster will be trading in the same range for couple weeks before deciding to bounce back or correct deeper plunging below 7. Yet, any long self respecting investor should still have some of position open, as there is always a surprise factor which can lift the stock so fast and so high that you wont have a chance to blink. Just my opinion. DCA is the way to go with this one, so good luck to everyone. Yes the stock is undervalued, yes it is without a doubt being played right now by big money, but look at the bright side - you can buy this still under-radar lidar company with stellar potential for double the book value. It is one of my favorite stocks on the market, so I am excited to see where Ouster is in 10 years."

Following those purchases the stock market writ large goes up but the share price of Ouster declines.The managers of all 3 of those financial firms are mistaken? Rhetorical question.....I think not.That leaves the probability(?) the share price is being manipulated. If so who and why?The likely culprits are the same 3 financial advisory groups(who). They are certainly in a position to manipulate a stock that trades maybe $5-10mil of trades a day. The money at the disposal of the 3 firms is greater than the money of 99% of the countries in the world.It would be nice to know exactly who has the 5mil + short position.  I suppose it&#39;s possible that some of that position could be held by the same 3 entities.  Or is it someone that knows a lot more about the future of LiDAR/Ouster than Blackrock, Vanguard, and State St?If the above house of cards is correct then how is the money made?Either 1) insider info re contract 2) takeover by known entityJust musing around until the game starts later today."

Ouster has already proven that the company should be worth at least $10.30 to $14.42 per share, no matter how fiscally conservative you want your analysis to be. At this level, OUST is at a safe Entry Point for new investors, and an opportunity to average-down for others.As for all the nonsense about a buyout - don&#39;t ever let anyone tease your emotions on that issue, it&#39;s something that is either real, and a real surprise when you hear of it, or it&#39;s a worthless rumor. Invest in what&#39;s real - Ouster&#39;s past performance, while awaiting a better future."

Some company out of Austin ....don&#39;t remember the name.One possibility of how it plays out is maybe 20 or so big cities with downtown traffic install a sensor then some months later order 10 or 12 additional.

Yeah, Q-over-Q wasn&#39;t as high as we&#39;d like, but the entire Annual growth is still tracking to be a 30-50% Revenue growth YEAR, no matter the delay of those 2,000 sensors that shifted right to 3rd Quarter and beyond.Speaking of that 2k Sensor sale - that&#39;s huge, not to be underwhelmed. At current Revenue pace, that&#39;s half a Quarter in sales, for that one customer alone. It&#39;s a binding deal, but they needed to fix something on their platform. Considering it&#39;s half a quarter in sales, you don&#39;t rock the boat for such a sale.Debt Free. The Ouster CFO talked this issue in the Earnings Call, and detailed that the debt was paid this month, in August, so it&#39;s a 3rd Quarter transaction and the 10-Q Balance Sheet will still show the debt, because that was the close-out for end-of-June. OUST is worth at least $1/share more with that $42M debt off the books. Reminder - UBS forced OUST to put up $52M in restricted cash for the Line of Credit, so OUST also freed up more cash than the debt owed (and paid).ADAS competition is coming to OUST (or better stated, Ouster is going to take it to the competition). Look at the Investor Presentation linked at Ouster IR page. Ouster is now pushing into ADAS competition in the Auto Industry. That speaks toward confidence in the ongoing development of DF Sensor. I don&#39;t blame the CEO for not talking spec&#39;s on DF Sensor, because it&#39;s a game-changer.Cost cutting. Look at 10-Q."

Although we had the benefit of an Institution-led run-up last Quarter, partly due to timing of Ouster being added back into the Russell 3000 Index, Ouster was also not yet becoming the clear winner in the LiDAR race.  Now? There is real fear out there - of Ouster&#39;s competitors, and of the financial Institutions that wrongly guessed as to who would become a successful LiDAR developer and manufacturer. Those Institutions only have themselves to blame - in many cases, they put lower tier Analysts on the task of determining who the best LiDAR companies are, and as often happens, they were fooled by glossy tri-folds and Investor Presentations while the Analyst did not fully understand the Hard Science of the underlying technology - Electro-Optical LiDAR Sensors. These are mostly analysts that in their day job, normally cover Auto Parts companies that make tires and brakes.  Very few &#34;Pick a Stock&#34; firms picked Ouster to emerge the victor. While we do have Vanguard and Blackrock support, they are &#34;buy everything&#34; firms and don&#39;t selectively pick winners.That fear of Ouster&#39;s competitors - both geo-political (Hesai, Robosense) and tech/sales wise (all other US-based LiDAR) has made enemies. A whole army of Hedge Funds was brought in to buy/short/prey on Ouster in the last week. Don&#39;t let the goons fool you into selling."

Silence is only golden if it turns out to be....idle mouths are no better than idle hands in this respect...and everyone knows the saying about idle hands. I tend to lean towards &#34;there must be a problem&#34; if I don&#39;t know the reason until I know the reason and do know there is not a problem! Know matter how much I believe in Ouster, Ouster in my opinion has the worst PR of any stock I have ever owned....NONE! You certainly will never become King of the Lidar Hill by playing or looking like the Jester of the Tent Camps! With all that being said only three things come to mind that would cause this....One, as I said earlier, might be a possible lockdown for a buyout, two, there may truly be issue&#39;s that we are currently unaware of and three, you, your spokesperson and possibly all of your PR department need to be replaced!

Many have heard of those two.18,764,458 shares held out of 37.12mil float.  About 14mil +/- available.  That could be 1 day of trading given the right set of circumstance.  Those circumstances would include any sort of quality press release from the company.  Subtract the 5mil+ shares short per yahoo. I&#39;m thinking that number a lot lower based on yesterday&#39;s trading but nonetheless the numbers suggest to me the possibility of another meteoric rise.Angus should be appreciating the value of a higher share price(ATM sales).  Maybe even an appreciation of public relations to get that price.Likely a good time to join Blackrock and Vanguard."

Conclusion, anyone selling at these levels is selling at a valuation of 2.15x revenues for a business that will increase revenues by 30% this year.

Let&#39;s talk about it...Cantor Fitzgerald, who always gets OUST Price Target wrong, and consistently negative in their analyst calls. Cantor over-bought into MVIS a long time ago, essentially placed their bets on MicroVision winning out in LiDAR, and made a big mistake. They have an interest in recouping lost money in MVIS, and have not bought into OUST like they could have, to this point. Citi, who also chose poorly, over-leveraging themselves into LAZR at higher prices, always favoring high Price Targets on LAZR while low-balling Price Targets on OUST. Their analyst covering both LAZR and OUST was in the bottom 20 of over 6,000 analysts for performance. Won&#39;t be surprised if he was fired already.GS, who favors INVZ, was a holder of INVZ shares and helped orchestrate their secondary offer, although things may have turned and GS may have sold off all INVZ holdings at this point. GS was never favorable toward OUST and is still on the sidelines for an analyst to cover Ouster. Considering that OUST went public via SPAC, and GS has typically been anti-SPAC, there&#39;s that aspect also.Speaking of SPAC, there&#39;s a long list of anti-SPAC institutions, some of which have still not bought into OUST, out of &#34;principle&#34; of their own internal rules. Yes, there are some firms that have blacklisted most all SPAC companies, except if that company uses their services for an Equity Offer or Loan."

Some of the forward-looking information is clarified there, and you&#39;ll see mention of expansion into ADAS as well (it&#39;s &#34;game on&#34; for competition against Luminar). Some of the goals they listed are already achieved (such as 40% Gross Margins), while others are still ahead of them. I&#39;m still going over it myself, trying to nitpick what they may have missed or such. We should ping their IR with notes if they have gaps in information or anything needs more clarity. This IR - they&#39;re like the junior varsity at this point, and in need of training, to be blunt."

Ouster will have to prove out the 2,000 sensor sale contract next 10-Q and that will justify TTM P/S 5 at minimum, although I think they&#39;re already justified at P/S 7 but that&#39;s an opinion of an Individual Investor, whereas Mr. Market may only elevate OUST to TTM P/S 5 until Ouster shows that both sales growth and future DF Sensor tech are &#34;in the bag&#34; (pun intended for any poor bag holders)."

Ouster (NYSE: OUST) remains in a freefall triggered by Q2 results, with shares losing another 27% Wednesday, sliding below the 200-day moving average for the first time since March and leaving a wide gap from Tuesday’s low.Although the initial knee-jerk reaction was a result of below-consensus Q2 sales and downbeat Q3 guidance, the continued pressure on the stock seems to be fueled by comments from management on the company’s earnings call, specifically, delayed customer purchases and the origin of a substantial improvement in its gross margin. CEO Angus Pacala acknowledged that the gains were fueled by cost-cutting and moving more product to contract manufacturing, rather than increased volumes."

This isn&#39;t just a matter of LiDAR installed on anything that moves - it&#39;s the potential for multi-sensor arrays all round anything that moves.As I&#39;ve explained before - Think like a Jeweler who sells diamond rings. You care most about revenue and margins per ring, not per diamond, once you sell multi-diamond &#34;cluster&#34; rings. LiDAR used to be a niche, single sensor deployment.

Digital LiDAR-on-a-chip, and version 2 in progress, as first version was a year ago and B Samples went out for feedback from Auto OEMs. Since it&#39;s chip based, the chip matters most. New Chronos chip taped out per CEO in Earnings conf call yesterday. He said the &#34;new silicon...doubles the range&#34; of the sensor, and that Moore&#39;s Law now applies for this family of chip-based sensors, to expect exponential improvements in spec&#39;s as each generation is developed - so I take that as improvements in range, laser quality, and power consumption over time (and any other improvements you&#39;d expect from an Electro-Optical sensor). This is Hard Science stuff but it&#39;s what comes next for LiDAR, just like cameras eventually shrunk to now be digital and chip-based and so small you have multiple cameras on your Smartphone. That&#39;s where this is headed."

Nothing was said toward this in the Earnings Call, but Ouster is also trading oddly after this earnings report in contrast to prior quarters of the last year, and sometimes a company is actually held down by Hedge Funds when either Private Equity or a major S&amp;P 500 company wants to acquire a smaller public company on the cheap. My opinion - even a defense industry giant may want a LiDAR Division in their company, to make LiDAR subsystems for weapon systems, while profiting from commercial applications. Shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise if someone is knocking on Ouster&#39;s door (and Angus&#39; door) in the future, making the company a &#34;deal they can&#39;t refuse.&#34;If I were to list a top-3 list of companies that I think would be interested in buying out Ouster, it would be:HoneywellRaytheonL3Harris"

The forward guidance should be clarified as either with/without that delayed sales contract added in, considering how much an impact it will have on reporting quarter(s) going forward. I think that single topic that went into some detail during the earnings call - showed that the Analysts want to know more about it, but Ouster needs to explain precisely what it means to both the Top and Bottom line."

If one trusts those sources to make their investment decisions, instead of actual financial data from trusted sources, well - good luck with that. Ouster lost much less than last year, so year-over-year quarterly results were way better in both Revenue and Loss per share terms, and if you look at actual published news sources, none of them say Ouster &#34;missed&#34; on earnings, but they are saying the future earnings were pegged lower than expected, and that may be an oversight by the CEO and CFO as to how they bake in that carry-over of the 2K sensors to be sold on delay going into next quarter. Analysts wanted a future $30M quarter but OUST leadership says $27-29M but at this point I&#39;m expecting a blowout quarter in the $30-32M range."

About the debt and Balance Sheet &#34;we will move aggressively in different directions&#34; - because of the strong balance sheet. (almost sounded like possible acquisition as a possibility, but Angus didn&#39;t specifically say that)Analyst follow-up question, L4 chip, &#34;are you addressing high-end markets?&#34; Angus: Digital LiDAR is still at core of our technology, Ouster products are going to be exponentially better, based on Moore&#39;s Law and chips doubling the range of our products (sensors).&#34;"

Software recurring revenue? Angus talked software-attached sales, record quarter for those sales. Customers are expanding from pilot phase (single installation) to expanded area deployment.Analyst: Some contracts pushed to right, are they non-cancellable? Angus: we have contracts that are binding, non-cancellable, as entered in bookings. Confidence in those customers (coming through with the buys slipped right). This discussion adds up to why Ouster didn&#39;t have a $30M blowout quarter btw.Angus: &#34;10s or hundreds of intersections now in discussion from prior pilot phase&#34; (which was only one single intersection that Ouster sensor+Blue City software were installed into).Angus: 1/3 of our Revenue was from Smart Infrastructure sales, with record quarter for Software-attached sales. We expect Smart Infrastructure to normally have sofware attached sales (which is huge when you consider they&#39;re going from single intersection installations to 10s or hundreds of intersections now).The delays of those sales shifted right - NOT Ouster&#39;s fault, it&#39;s the customer working on technical issues on their end, to get their platform more ready for the 2K sensor sale to them (clearly sounds like Serve Robotics is growing so fast they&#39;re working on certain tech issues)."

My cost basis is under $10 on this second round of holding OUST, so I&#39;m averaging up at this point.One thing we haven&#39;t mentioned recently - Angus has not appeared on as many Podcasts as he used to. I suppose there&#39;s a couple ways to look at this - either he doesn&#39;t think he needs to generate extra hype to buy into the stock, or perhaps there are too many sensitive irons in the fire from Hesai cases to R&amp;D wringing out the future of LiDAR, and he&#39;d rather not disclose anything yet.There are things in public news that Ouster should be embracing and talking about - such as their planned deployment of sensors throughout Orlando International Airport. We haven&#39;t heard Angus say a word about that yet. While they have other Airport installations also in the works - a place like Orlando is such a tourist hub, it is a good reference point because many of us have been there before.  This may sound like an unnecessary point or reminder - but part of Angus&#39; challenge is to help translate the hard science of LiDAR electro-optics sensors - into the impact on everyday lives of the people that could benefit from more ubiquitous adoption of the technology. That whole &#34;Why should I care about LiDAR?&#34; that any typical person on the street (or in the airport) could ask."

Outside of that, I don&#39;t expect to hear about Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Waymo, or even hints of Tesla (for calibration sensors). At this point it&#39;s wishful thinking to hope for hearing about those type companies that Ouster is very willing to sign NDAs as they sell product.I also want to see how Long-Term Debt is being handled now, and that it isn&#39;t creeping up. Angus needs to get ahead of this - it&#39;s what has crushed Luminar, that convertible debt of theirs, and the whole point of a Public Company is to use stock shares as currency to capitalize the company. Interest Rates are far too high to expand debt or grow new debt."

And Puck - don&#39;t even bother to post your nonsense, as I&#39;ve muted all your accounts.Hesai sensors are Made in China, so inherently they should not be purchased and installed on US military equipment, no matter the location of their corporate headquarters. Worse, there is a record of Chinese military equipment in prototype form with Hesai LiDAR sensors installed, on display at military Tradeshows. This entire episode smacks of people in the US Government being bought off, Hunter Biden style. This won&#39;t end well, and is merely the battle before the War, and sadly - any real shooting war has just become more dangerous to US Troops.What should Ouster do? For starters, appeal the ITC&#39;s prior decision to the Federal Appeals court and restart that entire process above and outside ITC&#39;s influence (that is also corrupted by a boss who previously was beholden to foreign interests).  Ouster has to take the gloves off."

At this moment one might say we are in the early stage of a possible ubiquitous tech. The use cases are numerous. The potential revenues are enormous.Why Ouster? On researching LiDAR Velodyne stood out at least in part because of the IP. Even though the executive group was in chaos I bought a thousand shares. That was 6/29/22 at $12.19 per share. I continued to research and discovered Ouster. The difference between Ouster and the perceived LiDAR leader Luminar could not be any more stark. The Luminar CEO is a poser in both the literal and figurative sense. A photo op kinda guy. Pacala on the other hand is an engineer and acts like one. Big plus in my book based on the tech being engineer specific. Even the locations ...Silicon Valley vs Florida...point me to Ouster.I don&#39;t celebrate Luminar&#39;s downfall. It casts a shadow on the tech and the sector. On the plus side it absolutely confirms that the ADAS portion of LiDAR tech is wide open. imho that&#39;s all about form factor/cost. A good ER tomorrow could restore some faith in the tech going forward and establish Ouster as the commanding leader in US LiDAR.My current share price average is $7.01 so no matter what happens tomorrow and Wednesday, I will remain long.Edit...I like that Bosscoms concurs...."

And I agree with criticism toward ATM sales of stock btw, that&#39;s one thing we do see eye-to-eye, as I had recommended Ouster buy back shares in the $4-5 range and use up to $25M of their cash, which would now be worth 2-3 times as much and have precluded the need for ATM sales (we&#39;d have about 10M fewer shares in the market if OUST had done so). But, I&#39;m not the CEO, I&#39;m just a long-term investor who already sold after holding OUST over a year, and now I only trade the stock at selective valuation levels, since OUST is still finding its way. Regardless, valuation still matters, and you really need to round out your chart-watching with Valuation Data if you want to avoid getting burned again - such as with LAZR."

However, everyone had a chance to buy in again over the last 15 months after Reverse Split, so the Cost Basis could have been averaged down by anyone in that situation.You&#39;re just not articulating Reality, Mark. You are posting as if the entire board is in the Worst Case Scenario of buying pre-RS and holding a bag, and that&#39;s just fantasy on your part, living in your own head, but not reality.Now do the math on $4 Cost Basis of OUST, sold at $14.  Or $5 Entry Point, then sold at $14, or $6 Entry Point -- those are the levels that many people here at the board have experienced in the past year. I&#39;m on the lower end of that scale, and nearly tripled my money in OUST, and now back in with new Entry Point in the $9s.  And what&#39;s wrong with that, Mark? In your world, everyone is a SPAC entry investor that should be hateful toward anyone posting positive views of Ouster now, right? It&#39;s misguided and disrespectful of those who actually want to share information and learn about LiDAR tech (which is complicated in itself) and enrich themselves by getting a better Entry Point in the stock."

The FEC may as well start regulating Media instead of the FCC.Inklings: Heresy. Most Newspapers don&#39;t print a paper any more. And most are owned by Gannett, a real trashy organization that I wouldn&#39;t invest a dime in, btw.Clues: Who needs clues when you have old video footage of a person saying exactly what they did, and what they think? Heck, Walz said he was a Retired Command Sergeant Major, when in reality he was demoted down to Master Sergeant because he did not satisfy the requirements to retain his rank of CSM before Retirement. But don&#39;t tell that to the Media (see Suggestions paragraph above).Oh, wait, you were talking about Ouster, but this was such a great rant, I just can&#39;t let it go to waste."

Luminar, Innoviz, MicroVision, and now AEye also - those companies are all failing, and the primary problem for all of them is that they lack true leadership. Lots of Opportunists among all those CEOs, as they know how to make a buck through the process of being a Public Company - but in general are not top-tier scientists or engineers. LiDAR is an Electro-Optics technology.  Show me who among them are top-tier experts on Electro-Optics technology. I dare you - look at their track record in Academia and Industry, and who among them actually has a grasp on, and is ahead of their peers for advancing Electro-Optics technology. Who among them is invited to speak at MIT? Or Stanford? And I&#39;m not talking about speaking at the Business/Marketing departments - but the Engineering schools.The fact is, most investors who have been duped - are clueless as to the science behind LiDAR Technology, and just how much of a &#34;Hard Science&#34; this is. You cannot drop out of college or fake it, and hope to advance this technology. You just can&#39;t. That&#39;s why I dub all these CEOs - the &#34;Clowns of LiDAR.&#34;"

From a quick look, I suspect Austin was comparing Ouster&#39;s older sensor offerings, which tend to be limited to 100m range, to Luminar&#39;s offerings. Ouster now has long range sensors among it&#39;s line up options, with an effective 400m max range...\n\n905 and 850nm, which Ouster also uses, use less power and this is key for robotics applications and for conserving power in general. Ouster claims 805nm is better at penetrating rain, fog and snow. There&#39;s a good &#34;what is lidar?&#34; page where Ouster describes this..\n\nSense Photonics had made huge progress with solid state lidar and Ouster&#39;s acquisition of the company long ago was a very important move. Because of that tech, Ouster should soon be able to release the suite of highly capable solid state, low cost, low power consumption sensors meant for autos and autonomous driving.\n\nThere are other Ouster longs who lurk here who have a waaaay deeper understanding of all of this. In particular, I&#39;m interested in how Ouster&#39;s newest sensors compare with Luminar&#39;s Halo and newest sensor tech etc."
