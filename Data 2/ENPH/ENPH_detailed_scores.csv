Reddit,2024-10-22,"lets dive into these earnings reports! Enphase Energy ENPH Enphase is in the solar tech game, and youre right about the challenges theyve faced. their recent quarterly earnings have shown significant declines they reported 26 and 24 in Q1 and Q2, respectively. these drops can be attributed to several factors, like slowing solar demand and tighter margins, especially with rising costs for materials and competition. analysts have mixed opinions going into this earnings call. while some think the companys longterm prospects remain solid due to the growth of renewable energy, others are concerned about their ability to maintain margins and grow internationally . Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT on the flip side, Vertivs performance has been more stable, but they too face market pressures. the company focuses on critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, which have seen steady demand due to the ongoing digital transformation across industries. analysts expect a modest earnings beat, but theres also skepticism regarding future growth amid rising competition and market saturation in certain sectors .

Reddit,2024-09-27,"As of September 2024, the West continues to impose heavy sanctions and restrictions on imports of many Russian goods, particularly in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions.

With $598.3 million available in the program, they will spend at least $100 million in this quarter.&#34;In July 2023, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “2023 Repurchase Program”) pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The Company may repurchase shares of common stock from time to time through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 434,947 shares of common stock from the open market at an average cost of $114.48 per share for a total of $49.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1,659,578 shares of common stock from the open market at an average cost of $115.51 per share for a total of $191.7 million.

Yahoo,2024-10-23,"Several takeaways after this earnings call:  It is clear that the next 2 quarters (Q4 and 2025 Q1) are going to be a &#34;turn-around&#34; transition period for Enphase.  While that may shake some investors&#39; confidence, I am hopeful.  Why ?  Because  Badri didn&#39;t shy from the analyst&#39;s question on their market share being pulled away from the Tesla Powerwall 3.  He did admit it was a problem, and they&#39;re are addressing the full backup market with the new 4th gen 10kW battery + the new meter collar that&#39;s coming out in 1Q 2025, and the new IQ9 inverters later in 2025.  They are also already engineering the next GaN system that can handle higher power at higher frequencies, both for the high-power system market (Brazil, etc) and medium power (US / Europe). Curious that 2 analysts asked about the solar market in India.  Both Badri and Rahgu commented on the fact the their current system (5P / IQ8) are primed to take market share in the luxury single-housing market there (smaller power systems, 10 kWhr max per day).. and they said ENPH can ship &#34;old&#34; inventories to India in 2025 + beyond, while pushing new models in the US market.  Incidentally, India&#39;s largest solar panel manufacturer just had a huge IPO just 2 days ago.   Plus, IEAE just opened their 2nd HQ in Singapore this year.  Ppl are saying that the SE Asian energy market will be a force to reckon with in 3 - 5 years.  If you have a 3-yr time horizon, I do feel that ENPH is heading in the right direction.

Yahoo,2024-10-22,"I find it very revealing how on this forum there is almost zero talk about the actual hardware that Enphase sells. 

Almost no one seems to realizes that with the disappearance of net metering and the advent of variable time of usage rates how important a battery storage, DC to DC charging and the grid tie interface has become. Unfortunately Enphase&#39;s micro inverters are not optimum for this type of system and that has in the past been their only real advantage. Their Grid tie interface/Battery storage system is too expensive, complicated in it&#39;s hardware and difficult to install along with the wrong size battery modules. 

they are working on trying to improve their solution for these problems and I am sure they will come up with something more competitive but the big question is when?

Folks if you will look at their actual product you will see why Enphase MUST quickly change to adapt to the new market conditions which ARE NOT RULED only by interest rates and any political results but by economics of the system function and cost.

the point one learns here is that these so called Analysts are useless.. they promote company for the big guys to sell and bash it for them to buy at lower prices ...

Yahoo,2024-10-16,"I find it funny how almost everyone on this forum talks about conspiracy theorys of market manipulation, high interest rates, politics, past dominance of Enphase&#39;s section of the market. always some reason why Enphase is doing so poorly and why at some point it will just take off again.

No one seems to talk about how the switch over to net metering all over the USA is changing the game completely for new Solar installations. The fact is Enphase&#39;s present whole home solution is not economically the best solution in that it is less efficient, more expensive and more complicated to install. IN FACT it is approximately 35% more expensive to buy and install.

while short term PPS can move in any direction long-term trend seems destined to be down until they reinvent and start producing an improved battery grid tie system. 

All you speculaters out there who think Enphase must recover soon need to realize this company is a producer of hardware and it&#39;s hardware MUST be competitive to survive and thrive which it has been in the past but is not now.

I believe they must be furiously working on that now but can they do that in time? I will be on the side line but hopefully repurchasing the 1800 shares I recently sold when I see signs of this.",Negative,-1,0.5309113264083862,Main

Then, the article says currently, 6% of systems with Enphase micro-inverters in CA have Powerwall 2 batteries (which is super-old technology now).  It goes on to pump up the Tesla Powerwall 3, saying that powerwall 3 has internal inverters installed.  Well guess what - Enphase batteries have internal microinverters too, and they&#39;ve been there forever.Badri already said that at least 50% of Enphase systems are installed with Enphase batteries.

Yahoo,2024-10-03,"I think people here need to realize the main reason that Enphase is struggling has little to do with interest rates but most to do with how net metering has all but disappeared. Most people now need a smart battery system along with panels for solar to make sense for most people especially true for people in their biggest market - which is California. 

How this effects Enphase so badly is their basic system design with battery storage is one of the worst available. It is unbelievable bad, inefficient and complicated a real Rube Goldberg system compared to the likes of Tesla Powerwall 3 and others.

I have owned Enphase stock since in the 20&#39;s but this morning sold 1700 of my 1800 shares as unless they completely redesign there battery system I think there is zero way forward for this company as a smart simplified battery system is a must all around the world going forward. 

This smart simplified battery system is an absolute necessity going forward as all electric grids are on the way to instituting time of use rates.

if Enphase phase does not do something quickly, they are going to be the next Polaroid camera.

I have held on to a hundred shares just for old time&#39;s sake but I don&#39;t see me hanging on to those last hundred for very long. 

now you all can go back to your discussions about interest rates and who&#39;s going to be president. but all that stuff is actually meaningless for Enphase right now. they must figure out a way to improve their system so that it works with time of use rate charges efficiently and is easy for installers to install with minimal labor cost, not maximum labor cost as their system requires now.",Neutral,0,0.9812794923782349,Main

Well...1.) An interest rate cut is typically followed by a J-curve, rather than a straight increase in post-cut demand.2.) Now that homeowners and home-builders know that we&#39;re finally in a rate cut cycle, it makes sense for them to wait for at least one or two more rate cuts before entering into solar contracts. Wouldn&#39;t you do the same thing if you were planning to finance an upcoming solar project? (This is part of the reason we see a J-curve after a cut).3.) The 4th quarter and 1st quarters are typically pretty weak for solar comparatively 4.) Oil futures are largely down over the year (look at CL=F for one such futures chart)5.)
