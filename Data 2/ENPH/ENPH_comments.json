I am not certain about FSLR. They produce panels especially for utility scale. With the recent tariffs on panels imported from China, they seem to be more in play. 3. ENPH has a decent moat on the microinvertor tech, but their strength is their ecosystem invertors, battery, EV chargers and energy management last two still fairly new and I anticipate at some point in the future, theyll charge customers a monthly fee as they would help the customer save money on Energy management because of dynamic tariffs in various geos a few years away though.

Chinese manufacturers are heavily subsidized by the state, and are a risk to FSLRs moat.

Enphase Energy ENPH Enphase is in the solar tech game, and youre right about the challenges theyve faced. their recent quarterly earnings have shown significant declines they reported 26 and 24 in Q1 and Q2, respectively. these drops can be attributed to several factors, like slowing solar demand and tighter margins, especially with rising costs for materials and competition. analysts have mixed opinions going into this earnings call. while some think the companys longterm prospects remain solid due to the growth of renewable energy, others are concerned about their ability to maintain margins and grow internationally . Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT on the flip side, Vertivs performance has been more stable, but they too face market pressures. the company focuses on critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, which have seen steady demand due to the ongoing digital transformation across industries. analysts expect a modest earnings beat, but theres also skepticism regarding future growth amid rising competition and market saturation in certain sectors . Strategy it sounds like youre leaning towards a short position on ENPH due to its struggles. its definitely a highrisk play, especially with earnings around the corner. make sure to keep an eye on the market reactions postearnings, as volatility can swing both ways!

However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions. Admiteddly, severed all ties is a bit excessive, severed most of them is more accurate."

Current market value is 12,206% over basis, easily my best performing stock %-wise, but not $-wise. But currently the stock is about $60 shy of it&#39;s 52-week high and continues to fall.

Re-bought the 1800 shares I sold at 106 and bought back for average around 79.50.\n\n I liked the new battery storage/Grid tie interface product update and this makes me feel we are at a turn around point for orders by the 1st or 2nd quarter. This hopefully will show up in the PPS sooner and Enphase could well be back!\n\nIf this updated system is as good as it sounds it could be a huge win for Enphase. Tesla and Enphase could then remain as the dominant players though there is going to be a lot of new competition. \n\nPeople will pay a premium and gravitate to those two though because of the strength of their respective reputation. PLENTY of room in the market for these two to really grow. \n\nhave to say also that Forward PE  now looking very good."

Hopefully Enphase got it right this time.\n\nBattery size good - meter collar tie huge - much lower labor cost to install a simplified inverter/charge system - these were the basic problems of their last effort. \n\nGood luck ENPHASE !"

While that may shake some investors&#39; confidence, I am hopeful.  Why ?  Because  Badri didn&#39;t shy from the analyst&#39;s question on their market share being pulled away from the Tesla Powerwall 3.  He did admit it was a problem, and they&#39;re are addressing the full backup market with the new 4th gen 10kW battery + the new meter collar that&#39;s coming out in 1Q 2025, and the new IQ9 inverters later in 2025.  They are also already engineering the next GaN system that can handle higher power at higher frequencies, both for the high-power system market (Brazil, etc) and medium power (US / Europe). Curious that 2 analysts asked about the solar market in India.  Both Badri and Rahgu commented on the fact the their current system (5P / IQ8) are primed to take market share in the luxury single-housing market there (smaller power systems, 10 kWhr max per day).. and they said ENPH can ship &#34;old&#34; inventories to India in 2025 + beyond, while pushing new models in the US market.  Incidentally, India&#39;s largest solar panel manufacturer just had a huge IPO just 2 days ago.   Plus, IEAE just opened their 2nd HQ in Singapore this year.  Ppl are saying that the SE Asian energy market will be a force to reckon with in 3 - 5 years.  If you have a 3-yr time horizon, I do feel that ENPH is heading in the right direction. Short-term pain?  Sure.."

Basically no growth and stock is still priced as a growth stock. \n\nIt needs to start growing earning again or PPS will continue down.\n\n\nReally pretty simple but the hard part for them is to get the right product and no matter how good their micro inverters are that is not what will save them. They need to accept that and move to battery storage/grid tie, which they have tried to do,  but did not deliver a good product and thus in this new era they are falling behind.\n\nHas been a great company - on the cutting edge - but has lost their mojo. I was in this stock for years and first bought in at $22 but only incremental improvements to their micro inverters for years and now none of their other products being a good value caused me to sell my 1800 shares a few weeks ago.\n\nIf I see them again come out with some industry leading products, which they might, then I will be back in. Unfortunately that goes not seem to be happening right now and we might witness a slow bleed down on this stock much lower than most people can imagine."

Unfortunately Enphase&#39;s micro inverters are not optimum for this type of system and that has in the past been their only real advantage. Their Grid tie interface/Battery storage system is too expensive, complicated in it&#39;s hardware and difficult to install along with the wrong size battery modules. \n\nthey are working on trying to improve their solution for these problems and I am sure they will come up with something more competitive but the big question is when?\n\nFolks if you will look at their actual product you will see why Enphase MUST quickly change to adapt to the new market conditions which ARE NOT RULED only by interest rates and any political results but by economics of the system function and cost. Everything else is just noise."

This is one of them.  Sentiment may change after next week, but should the earnings be short of stellar, this will continue its fall to lower prices.  When the consensus target is nearing $100, that kind of rules out big jumps in price from my spot in line.  Good luck cutting the queue.  You might be disappointed even if you were second in line."

You have your reason why you think what you think, and I&#39;ve got mine (which, at this point, I think share price action is most due to the past 3 quarters of depressed earnings due to macro conditions plus the pull-through of inventory in advance of NEM3.0 as well as supply chain issues from COVID/2022, as I&#39;ve been saying for months now).  I think the enphase system works very well with net metering (I am net metered), but when net metering payback goes down (as in the move from NEM2.0 to NEM3.0 in CA), the Enphase system with batteries make it work even better for the homeowner than solar alone, which is why we&#39;re seeing attach rates go up.  And with increased attach rates come higher margins.  And selling battery power back is another way to reduce payback of one&#39;s system.  That&#39;s totally separate from net metering, btw.  I know it&#39;s not available everywhere but will be soon.  Not just with Enphase.  Ford is piloting it with it&#39;s bidirectional charger.  So, ok, you and I are not on the same page exactly, but I just have to say it&#39;s great that there are some pockets where useful debate happens here, and I thank you for that."

The fact is Enphase&#39;s present whole home solution is not economically the best solution in that it is less efficient, more expensive and more complicated to install. IN FACT it is approximately 35% more expensive to buy and install.\n\nwhile short term PPS can move in any direction long-term trend seems destined to be down until they reinvent and start producing an improved battery grid tie system. \n\nAll you speculaters out there who think Enphase must recover soon need to realize this company is a producer of hardware and it&#39;s hardware MUST be competitive to survive and thrive which it has been in the past but is not now.\n\nI believe they must be furiously working on that now but can they do that in time? I will be on the side line but hopefully repurchasing the 1800 shares I recently sold when I see signs of this."

Then, the article says currently, 6% of systems with Enphase micro-inverters in CA have Powerwall 2 batteries (which is super-old technology now).  It goes on to pump up the Tesla Powerwall 3, saying that powerwall 3 has internal inverters installed.  Well guess what - Enphase batteries have internal microinverters too, and they&#39;ve been there forever.Badri already said that at least 50% of Enphase systems are installed with Enphase batteries.  So this article is highlighting that tiny 6% slice of pie only, and it&#39;s with old technology.  Technical slander at best.... and of course, Enphase cannot comment because they&#39;re in their quite period.Anyways, I&#39;m looking forward to their earnings call and see what they say about all this !"

An older version of it, as I&#39;ve talked about for years -- IQ7x on the roof and a 23kW of gen 2 batteries. I took your comments seriously, and I looked through my whole system, and I just don&#39;t see it.  Yes, the enclosures for the shut off switch is of off-the-shelf, but would you really expect any company anywhere to create their own, proprietary custom electrical box?  Literally, the only part that I could say yes, they cheaped out on, is maybe the USB stick that goes in an older system&#39;s gateway that uses zigbee to connect to wifi?  But even if that comm system goes down (and admittedly, it is wonky, and they don&#39;t use it anymore on new systems), the entire system still works, and net metering is completely unaffected.  The only implication is you may not be able to see the info on your app.  Ok, the cellular modem is a bit wonky, too, but it&#39;s the back up for the comm, and it going down does not affect your solar production, export, net metering, etc.  The most important part of the battery are the microinverters, and those are all Enphase all the way.  They&#39;re market-leading in terms of lowest error rates, and they have the longest warranties of any home solar battery in the world.  The interconnection device is pretty standard and works well, and the new one is even better (so I&#39;ve heard - I have the old one and it&#39;s fine)."

It is just a matter of time. The trend is for more climate engendered emergencies and solar will be the first and best responder. Hang in there. There’s a bumpy road ahead, but those with solar powered resources will miss a lot of potholes along their way."

Most people now need a smart battery system along with panels for solar to make sense for most people especially true for people in their biggest market - which is California. \n\nHow this effects Enphase so badly is their basic system design with battery storage is one of the worst available. It is unbelievable bad, inefficient and complicated a real Rube Goldberg system compared to the likes of Tesla Powerwall 3 and others.\n\nI have owned Enphase stock since in the 20&#39;s but this morning sold 1700 of my 1800 shares as unless they completely redesign there battery system I think there is zero way forward for this company as a smart simplified battery system is a must all around the world going forward. \n\nThis smart simplified battery system is an absolute necessity going forward as all electric grids are on the way to instituting time of use rates.\n\nif Enphase phase does not do something quickly, they are going to be the next Polaroid camera.\n\nI have held on to a hundred shares just for old time&#39;s sake but I don&#39;t see me hanging on to those last hundred for very long. \n\nnow you all can go back to your discussions about interest rates and who&#39;s going to be president. but all that stuff is actually meaningless for Enphase right now. they must figure out a way to improve their system so that it works with time of use rate charges efficiently and is easy for installers to install with minimal labor cost, not maximum labor cost as their system requires now."

Higher interest rates were blamed for solar industry weakness, right?  Well...1.) An interest rate cut is typically followed by a J-curve, rather than a straight increase in post-cut demand.2.) Now that homeowners and home-builders know that we&#39;re finally in a rate cut cycle, it makes sense for them to wait for at least one or two more rate cuts before entering into solar contracts. Wouldn&#39;t you do the same thing if you were planning to finance an upcoming solar project? (This is part of the reason we see a J-curve after a cut).3.) The 4th quarter and 1st quarters are typically pretty weak for solar comparatively 4.) Oil futures are largely down over the year (look at CL=F for one such futures chart)5.)  Sunpower just went bankrupt, which added a whole lot of chaos in the residential solar market (many owners and installers wonder: who is servicing / honoring warranty on existing SPWR panels/sytem?).  Those are some of the reasons you may be seeing lower share prices."

California SB-1374 was vetoed, which, without context, looks like CA doesn&#39;t want to support solar.  We all know California is very supportive of solar and renewable energy in general.  There is a statement about WHY Gov. Newsom vetoed this bill :Excerpt:While I support the continued growth of the customer solar PV market, this bill would compound the challenge of electric bill affordability by overturning a key component of a recent CPUC decision adopting these alignment changes. Specifically, this bill would increase the amount that most customers would pay for their own electric service to provide a rate subsidy to certain customers, and public schools, that install solar PV systems on their property. For these reasons, I cannot sign this bill.The complete explanation is easy to locate on the Governor&#39;s site, by looking at the legislative updates for 9/27/24.  A complete explanation about every bill signed or vetoed is right there."

Enphase&#39;s battery system is not good at all or really even competitive. Components are to complicated and to expensive and way too much labour to install. leaves you with Rube Goldberg style system made with to many off the shelf parts instead of a well designed and manufactured purpose built system.\n\nCan&#39;t expect to capture a large segment of the market with this system so now Enphase will start to lose micro inverter sales as they become unnecessary for the other whole home panel and battery back up /storage systems such as Tesla which comes in with a much better system at appx 30% less.\n\nwill take a while for investors realize this but going to happen unless Enphase does something pretty quick. \n\nHubris is a terrible thing and I think a BIG problem with the CEO as for years they had an innovative product with no real competition. Think Polaroid Cameras."

Much of this caused by the large amount of labour to install their complicated system and the requirement of 3 of their modules to equal 1 Powerwall 3.\n\nI don&#39;t see how they can fix this as they have to use multiple of their micro inverters running in reverse to generate the AC power from the batteries. a real Rube Goldberg set up. Bad bad design that they have painted themselves into a corner with."

This is a swing trader&#39;s paradise.You will never get to buy the low and sell right at top, but by buying at $105, and selling at $125, would make you great profits.As you can see, prices got rejected again at the mid $120s. Now it is going to go back down to the mid $100s or so.Disclaimer: Not advice to buy or sell. Educational purposes only. Do not sue me."

I had my finger on the sell button when it was at 339. I sold some at 300 but wish I sold it all at that time and buy it back at 100. But I still hold a large position. Always said I have a 5 year minimum plan to hold this. Bought March low 2020. Fed will move soon and 2025 will be the start of a great ride. It went up over 200 points in 2022 alone. So it has the potential to repeat once the numbers Start to show growth. And it will. They are a great run company with great products."
