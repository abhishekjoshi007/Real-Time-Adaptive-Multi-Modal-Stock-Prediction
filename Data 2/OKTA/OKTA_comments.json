The company has been around for about 10 years now and has never been profitable on a GAAP basis. It looks like they spend a ton on sales and have exploded headcount since 2021, which seems insane. They have around 6,000 employees now. They do have free cash flow, but thats only because of SBC, which is basically just borrowing from existing shareholders. Naturally, the balance sheet shows the share count going up every single year. But really, the obvious flag for me is that Okta just does the one thing, and while that one thing is pretty darn important, it just doesnt seem investable to me. And then in addition to that, I question the management decision to hire so many people. I mean, how can a company that is this specialized have so many employees? What are all these people doing? It really doesnt make sense."

I know Lapus did this a couple years ago with the twillio, okta, door dash and some other companies. If three data breaches have occurred within the past few years alone. That means okta is not hardening their systems and the same vulnerabilities are exposed. Or there is a backdoor that they havent found and theirs different groups that are still within their system. Hackers might wait months or years before making a move. It can also take months for an enterprise to realize theyve been breached. They need to fully remediate their systems, harden them, and implement better endpoint detection. They also need to monitor the traffic on known and of course unknown services running during business hours. They also need to implement better access control user policies. Along with more social engineer training. Alot of their workers still might be working from home, meaning more social engineering tactics can be used. This also means they are running their computers on their own home networks"

In 2022, GitHub notified Okta that software repositories hosted in GitHub was copied. Not an Okta breach. In 2023, an attacker had unauthorized access to files inside Oktas customer support system. While true that data was leaked, this was limited to names and email addresses within the support systems. No user credentials or sensitive data was accessed. Oktas production systems were untouched. To this point, Oktas production systems have not been breached. After the most recent event in 2023 they pushed everything on their product roadmap for a security hardening. Their technology remains the best on the market by a long shot and gives folks the best chance at keeping their environments secure. Given the focus back on innovation after the security hardening as well as the huge reductions in price on the auth0 platform and expansion free licensing, I expect them to gain significant market share as they weed out low cost competitors and open source options"

Itll be a slow, minimally incremental climb over time at best. Theyre just as, If not more expensive than MailChimp for one. The only factor in my switching from MC is purely some added automation features. But again, I still ended up paying WAY more than MailChimp. Businesses like the ones I managed who had 500K 1m annual marketing budgets only see an incremental difference in effectiveness at an astronomical cost. Klaviyo does benefit the little guys moreif you have a low subscriber count and just need the basics, fine. But these same smaller guys are pissing away like a min 200500month IF THAT ad spend on metagooglewtv ads because its all they can afford. Meanwhile again, the real money is being spent by the big brands with larger budgets... and these big brands are better served by a service like salesforce because it solves the actual problems services like klaviyo or MC claim to solve, but theres a huge learning curve and restructuring in building these data analytics in even these large companies right now.. but in my experience, theyre starting to wise up to where the real problems are and where a real solution may lay. Klaviyos customer base of amateur shopify dropshippers with little to no funds are likely 75 of their end users, and if thats not true it will be eventually as like I said, big businesses start to wisen up as to how to do better data consolidation. Also, klaviyos sales teams are the single most grating, frustrating and annoying experience Ive endured and working in marketing, thats fucking impressive."

Revenue Growth was over 30 year on year, which I expect was partly due to high uptake in COVID. Expect this high year on year revenue growth was driving the high PFCF and with growth dropping over the last 3 years has lead to the large drop in share price. Right now the PFCF is sitting around 12, which I think is cheap if they can keep growing revenue and FCF. If they can keep up the growth, Id expect the share price to increase. Whether it can get back to 250 in the next 5 years will depend on whether they can accelerate their growth and whether you want to wait a bit for it to get to that level."

They read about upcoming earnings, they hear you can get mega rich off options, they read up on some of the companies and then just yolo hundreds or thousands into short term calls. When earnings arrive they then get completely blasted by Theta Burn which in turn will drive the stock price down which will then blow up IV Crush, both feed into itself and ultimately makes the stock price plummet. This has happened with Celsius, Reddit, Hims, you name it. Its only the under the radar stocks that have earnings go well where you see a legitimate climb, like Git Lab most recently."

First, look at the cash flow statement and you will see that stock based compensation is EXTREMELY high relative to the operating income generated by this company.  Yes, every company has stock based compensation but not this high.  Revenue, in my opinion, is not growing nearly fast enough to offset.  Second, this compensation is not broad based compensation to all employees but only a select few.  Lastly, this is likely driving the poor morale at the company as leadership tries to gain productivity at the expense of its lower levels to justify the huge compensation.  Stated in other words, this stock price has gotten ahead of it&#39;s ability to compensate it&#39;s own employees.  Doesn&#39;t look pretty from here."
