Reddit,2024-10-22,"BABA is up 25 over the past year while VOO is up 38 so thats not the success story youre making it out to be. Success in the market isnt just making a profit. If youre not beating the SP then youre losing. Bear in mind that while youre sitting on cash waiting for the next piece of bad news, that money isnt appreciating like it would with a set it and forget it approach. Also every time one of your picks starts to plateau and you decide to sell you have to give the tax man his cut which means you have less to reinvest. If you have to sell before youve owned the stock for a year then youll have to pay capital gains which will cut into your profit even more. All these things plus the fact that there isnt a guarantee that a stock will bounce back from bad news means that this is probably not the slam dunk you think it is. You may get lucky a few times but its probably not a sustainable investing strategy.",Positive,1,0.5688983798027039,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-13,"The comparison between Costco COST and CrowdStrike CRWD based solely on their forward PE ratios 50x for COST and 75x for CRWD and PEG ratios above 3 ignores key differences in their business models, growth trajectories, and market dynamics. Costco COST operates as a highvolume, lowmargin retailer. It has a stable, predictable cash flow, massive scale, and significant pricing power. The retail sector traditionally trades at lower multiples due to its lower growth potential compared to tech. CrowdStrike CRWD is a highgrowth cybersecurity company with a SaaS model. Its in a fastgrowing sector with a strong demand for cybersecurity, especially after recent highprofile breaches. Its high multiple reflects its future growth potential rather than current earnings. Based on the overvaluation of the market as you pointed out, plus intrinsic value vs value of the SP at 4080 depending on the metric you use, Buffet Indicator at 175 adjusted for inflation, equities should not be the priority for investing in this environment. yields bouncing around so quickly, the market is caught between worrying about inflation and worrying about recession. ratios SPYTLT, SPYGLD, etc. are showing the market is concerned with safe haven investments. the geopolitical issues, election year, debt ceiling in Jan. 2025 The obvious strategy as we see the market implementing is rotation into consumer staple equities, bonds, tbills, cash, KMLM, etc. Gold is useful but overvalued so that has to be factored in.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Tom Lee of fundstrat recently noted the SP minus the mag 7 has a PE of 18 and at current rates, treasuries have an effective PE of 25. In other words, if a company is not growing and doesnt need to grow, it can return all of its earnings as dividends and outperform treasuries. Some companies do this and even let earnings go negative before cutting 5 dividends. Some people say that treasuries and the dollar are bombproof and safe investments, but that is not always true, especially regarding some of the points you made. You have to put your money somewhere, because the dollar hasnt gone up in value for a very long time, but trust me that gold and crypto are not safe havens if there is a real growth scare and market crash down the road and Ive been through many. Some of the mag 7 have good forward PE ratios, some will have higher forward PE ratios unless they can turn earnings around. I personally dont bet that a company is just about to turn the corner with the next report, even if marketunderperforming analysts are optimistic, but bet that fundamental growth trends will continue until there is evidence to the contrary. I would certainly agree that some stocks are overvalued, but that is always true. Right now, I think a lot of dubious nongrowing software and plebian semi stocks have caught AI tailwinds when they probably wont benefit from all the demonstrably increasing spend on transformer GPUs and ASICs. With your overbought metrics, you should remember that in a bull market, things can stay overbought for years, the same years you should be in the market. But, I am sitting on 20 cash right now, which is the most in the last two years, hoping to deploy it this month. In addition to lots of electionrelated uncertainty around the world, and typical geopolitical risks, Im nervous about Israels response to Iran because the military leaders are making really ominous noises. Their proxy war has been ugly, but not nearly as ugly as it could be. Irans leaders could be delusional enough to launch missiles at Arab oil production and rain a lot more missiles down on cities than they have so far. In this case, Im not betting on cooler heads to suddenly prevail, because escalation is the apparent trend. Ill be glad if Im wrong, having missed out on some gains by briefly holding insurance and dry powder, but any appreciable selloff is an entry point for me. Over the next two years, I think interest rates are coming down. If they dont, economic and earnings growth will probably be the culprit, which is probably fine for stocks. It doesnt make sense to me for the Fed funds rate to be higher than the inflation rate for long periods of time, and it is right now. Stocks will crash in the future, but they will crash when companies dramatically decrease spending, which hasnt happened yet. Let me know when that happens. In a recession, companies cut spending by a lot, and the percent increase in unemployment and decrease in household spending usually doesnt compare. I think the scariest crashes happen when interest rates are low, because the Fed doesnt have as much ammo, and companies are more likely to have loaded up on debt that they think they can cheaply finance, until they cant.",Neutral,-1,0.9104334712028503,Reply

For example, you get a security system for your house, it gets hacked and someone breaks in and steals all your valuables. Here, the system failed to do the one thing its supposed to do. If that same system malfunctioned, locking you out of your house, sure thats also a big problem but at the end of the day, your valuables were still protected. So while yes, there were costly, global impacts to operations, this wasnt a largescale data lossbreach which Id argue has a bigger impact to reputation and operations than the outage. I personally dont think this kind of mistake ever happens again, and this incident shined a spotlight on weaknesses in organizations ability to execute effective contingency plans to remain operational",Negative,-1,0.9999169111251831,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-22,"At lower prices it was an intriguing bet for some investment firms because of the riskreward proposition. The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"Going to redirect to ChatGPT because it will answer the question in far more detail than I ever could The behavior youre describing aligns with what some people refer to as swing trading, which involves holding a stock for a short period days to weeks to capitalize on expected price movements. Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way.",Neutral,0,0.9998124241828918,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-05,"The media has been significantly misrepresenting the Crowdstrike updates. The PIR indicates significant, industrylevel testing for both sensor and cloud releases. The file that broke the host machines was not code per se in the classic sense it didnt change the software installed on the machine but rather it was more equivalent to a config file. I can guarantee that most companies ship similar config files to their hosts without testing. Its A LOT of work to add staggered publications for every file possible associated with a product. In an everyday sense, its almost similar to how journalists dont necessarily fully proofread their documents before sending them to their editors. If a file reader the editor used happened to have a bug that couldnt read the file correctly, the software breaks. In this case, it had devastating consequences but not because of negligence that differed from the industry standard, but rather because of a bug they didnt fully prepare for. All software has bugs and bugs make it out to production every day. Any publishersubscriber system is extremely hard to test in a staggered fashion. Have you noticed that test amber alerts are sent to EVERYONE, rather than just a couple of phones? Sending out config files typically doesnt follow the classical software validation system of canaries and test environments. You just have subscribers that receive it and you hope that the code that reads the messages correctly processes it. It sounds like Crowdstrike is indeed currently implementing systems where these files are rolled out in a staggered fashion, but its not going to be a simple process.

In addition, despite the recent drop we are closer to recent highs than to recent lows, so I wouldnt lump sum in now.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"So I agree with you that the market is likely overvalued, but Ive also learned a lot of stock market valuation is sentiment and not just discounted cash flow analysis. People who have waited to invest in periods of overvaluation have also typically missed out on strong returns as this can continue for a while. Many younger investors especially dont seem to know what it was like to essentially have a decade of no returns 2000 to 2010, or 1965 to 1983. Over the past 80 years of the stock market there have been several periods like this. Based on history it seems we are likely due for another period at some point of low returns. Like COVID no one can predict the exact event that will cause sentiment to change. As far as reasons why the stock market might not be overvalued 1 AI efficiencies become realized, 2 PE multiple expansion, due to more demand to invest in assets older people with retirement funds, more younger people saving, 3 tied with 2 a bit, the stock market may just be the best alternative available.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Funny thing about the market, no one knows until the trend snaps and you see it several years later that there was a clear bull and bear market. No one cares about valuation while the music is playing, and the street and buy side careers depend on on the fact you stay in it and play the game. Law of averages tell you over long periods something does occur and a discernible pattern emerges but is irrelevant if you are making short term decisions at the moment tick by tick with your life savings. Valuations can give you a picture but not the answer, and typically most utilized when attempting to explain something in hindsight, most times long after time to take action has passed. All this is occurring in time with the emergence and dominance of quantitative strategies in equities seems more than spurious to me.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"The macromacro economic gameplan moving forward looks clear. Productivity growth has stalled out in every developed economy in the world. Every developed economy save for SK is broke off its ass in terms of debt to GDP. Between demographic shortfalls, resource shortages, pollution, etc, there are no serious prospects for growth rates to catch back up. What future catalyst or technology will make the world more productive in 10 years than it is today? Chatbots? Every developed nation is thus pretty much bankrupt, and is implicity defaulting via currency inflation. Thats why stocks are running, and will keep running for a while. Any cashflowing asset that can keep up with inflation, is going to get pushed up with inflation. And I think inflation is going to be very persistent. Nothing lasts forever, and one day this trend will break down. My guess is what breaks it will be a major European sovereign debt crisis by around 2030. Think France going down rather than Greece. Productive capital will flee Europe, likely to America, and bond buyers will shit themselves and start demanding higher yields from already desperately broke governments. Where we go from there, I dont know.

My prediction is that some time in the future impossible to tell when exactly the US debt and subsequent interest payments will become too burdensome and there are two outcomes. The US dollar collapses or the government reduces spending and increases taxes seems unlikely, hard to get any votes this way. Either way it seems to me that this event will cause a market crash, however, I do understand that the USD isnt really comparable to other currencies and if anyone has any other alternative scenarios I would love to hear them. Because of this my current asset allocation is 50 fixed income, and the other 50 stocks. Within the stocks about half is in the US with an equal amount of long and short positions removing the risk of a crash or continued bull market and the other 50 is predominantly in China where great investment opportunities are abundant even when considering the risks which I think are overestimated.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Wheres the money going to go? They printed the majority of monetary supply in the last 10 years. That means we have trillions of dollars distorting capital markets across the world. Everything is extremely overpriced. Eg real estate is in most countries above the price where the median salary can afford it. Additionally the vast majority of this printed money has been given to large corporations, banks and the UHNW. This means that the people holding the money supply dont need to actually use it for consumption, its purely going towards investments and asset classes. Theres nowhere else for this money to go, and it keeps being printed. Were practically in a neofeudal society, the value of labour vs capital is worse than it was prior to the Great Depression but the financial markets have been successfully disconnected to reality, compared to back then. The only thing that can happen in the long term is a credit shock on the dollar, that is to say that a large range of investors into US treasuries and dollars stop buying and using them which isnt going to happen anytime soon because a failed USD would fail the entire global financial markets at the same time. Its a Ponzi scheme that needs to keep running off the backs of future generations. The other thing that can happen is a socialist revolution in various parts of the world that would lead to a massive shock in how secure economic assets are considered to be by investors. Right now the belief amongst banks and everyone else is that the world is capitalist and theres no way a country risks its economic future by not putting investors first.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"I used to be head of front office of a large bank of all trading desks. I started work in 99. What you call earnings, for us, was just investors relations IR telling us what the shareholders wanted their EPS to be as you can before filing a paper to the regulator simply modify your earnings to what the shareholders wanted. EPS is just an easily modified variable with no meaning. Check Truist Financial they sold a fire sale tactic aka drop your most profitable entity to ensure that even tho your dead in the water you still show inflated earnings. But you didnt earn anything. All you did was selling what you had. And companies arent making record profits. Not based on yield out of products out of revenue. Earnings come out of selling stuff off, or cutting employees which flips a loss into a profit. Doesnt change intrinsically that the firm is still bleeding money. Beyond Meat, Lyft, Peloton, Doordash, all are good examples. Earnings isnt debt restructuring. Debt isnt growth. Is extending the inevitable ever more expensive bill that will come eventually. Hence firms like Beyond Meat will die as they issued a huge debt and the redemption date is coming and they are loss making already no way they can pay that back. We finally get rid of the firms who solely lived on the regime of low interest rate and used that iteratively in loops to restructure their debt to keep liquidity while their actual product became less and less profitable. And the labor market is strong? Based on what? What the government says? Or their metrics? Since when did the government save us from disasters or recessions or anything else? last time I checked their so called governing of how healthy everything is during the mortgage crash. The IT crash. Etc never helped. So why trust a pattern that veils itself as we are safe yet all other recessions the government had it wrong? I dont know you yell me. This isnt a conspiracy this is simply stories in a history book of last recessions. And that pattern is there once more. Not that some firms arent truthfully growing some are Im long in some value stocks who I absolutely believe in but the majority is dead in the water. Because I dont comprehend when a firm is loss making. Has more debt than ever and debt one day has to be repaid. How on earth they will be able to afford it? They cant make new products no money they cant issue more debt because the yield will be higher crushing the margins on their own product line. Do explain please because I dont have an answer.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Its too far gone and the people who own assets today benefit far too much from this. The main victim so to speak is the younger generations, especially those who do not have inheritances or assets be it properties or stocks. But as you can see from what they protests about Palestine, Black Lives Matter, inclusion, lgbtq, etc they are only really literate on sociopolitical issues du jour and are not able to identify, and respond adequately to the socioeconomic issues. The problem described here is far beyond the intellectual awareness of the vast majority of the younger generations, so they dont get angry they just become shitty workers who dont care because theyre not paid enough to care. Theyre also not able to afford having families, houses, etc. The lie down movement in china is very much similar across the world in how younger generations are acting out in regards to their personal hopeless economic situations. This also means that there isnt enough political pressure to fix this, because the majority of boomers and older gen X benefit as well as literally anybody whose parents had good investments or assets. If your parents like mine didnt invest properly or successfully, you are sort of fucked unless you are a 1million entrepreneur or working in a ultra high demand industry like tech and are in a top position there. 401k system actually strongly benefits the USA overall in comparison to much of the world because it made a big proportion of the population benefit from the stock market and also made the us stock market much better return than others. It is essentially a Ponzi scheme because if there isnt more printed money or new entrants it wont deliver as high returns but right now this wont be likely to stop. Theres a few other countries such as Norway which also benefited due to a conscious strategy of investing in stocks and other high growth asset classes. Hence the most likely challenge to the current status quo will be major black swan events leading to radical capital outflows due to perceived high risk. A china us war may be one such event, but even that will be unlikely to actually lead to all that money being taken out of financial markets. More likely is that there will be a challenge to the power of capital assets by a coalition of countries.

You debt goes up. So if buy your debt, I obviously want a higher return because you are going to earn less. But for short term its soothing words for society. Back to the history books. Delusional leaders lead a country into further polarization. If I trust what history tells us thats how most, not all either civil war contained in a country or all out war. Its not me trying to convince anyone its basically repeating the patterns of history books we all got taught as kids. With simple logical patterns. If we get a new leader A or B. Well, history tells us they always want to quickly show something unknown unknown. To mark their territory. Regardless A or B. Problem is towards the elections the polarization is absolutely maddening. Left is extreme left, right is extreme right. Populism is easy speak to your voters what they wanna hear even if not economically viable so I hope regardless A or B elected they dont do more short term thinking. More spending for jobs to keep people happy short term By issuing more debt and more and more.. It works. Short term. Eventually a new generation will have to carry an immense burden. Im not left or right, I see it as a circle, walk long enough from left, you become a centralist to a right back to central. So for me I just focus on are the new A or B going to continue short sighted thinking dropping further opportunities for kids yet to come. Because hedge funds and banks arent that dumb, if you spend more than you earn, youll have to pay back more. Supply pool of voters are blissfully unaware but hedge funds and banks are not they see free cash. And I dont like it.

But what I am seeing from reading their CVE advisories and other articles is that a lot of new CVEs are produced by their own prorietary code, like this one is obviously their fault and they are the ones to blame and they still tried to downplay it. Their products are getting a lot of attention from state sponsored actors because they know how valueable the data of their customers is. Wether they like it or not, they will keep being targeted, how they handle it will determine their ability to maintain a leading position in the market.

Reddit,2024-08-26,"I figured you were new, thats okay. Try to learn as much as you can about options before you waste your cash. There is a metric to options, several actually, but one in particular called implied volatility IV for short. Iv plays a factor into options price, and iv is driven by expected events that would drive market price. Earnings is a big one, dates of known contract announcements or company announcements. The market knows all of this and tracks it through IV. The closer you get to these events, the IV will rise, causing the price of an option to rise with it. So by buying options for known events as far away from them as you can stomach, the cheaper you can get that same option for. You have to balance that with how much you think the price will change before that event though. Options are simple yet complicated. So if you buy an option today for earnings tomorrow, it will likely be as expensive as that option gets. Starting the moment the event happens, the iv begins to drop dramatically, lowering the price of the option. This is known as iv crush if you have heard that term used.",Neutral,0,0.9999313354492188,Reply

Ive used SentinelOne, but my experience with it is if you are doing any sort of development work on machines with it installed it will trigger false positives constantly. So the devs end up disabling it and you lose coverage in some of your most critical areas. PaloAlto is ok but you need to buy into their ecosystem.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"This is the weird thing though. Crowdstrikes services are the polar opposite of shit. Theyre the market leader in end point security. The creme de la creme. If it werent for the outage, and I was a CRWD salesman, I could probably tell the customer I fucked his wife and proceed to lay a fat shit out on the desk infront of them, and theyd still buy it. But with the outage, my only skepticism is whether this will put customers who dont already have a cybersecurity software away from Crowdstrike and end up choosing to go with a competitor purely because of the bad rep at the moment. That then slows growth during the aftermath period and without the crazy growth the price should in theory tank like fuck going by its current PE ratio.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"Stephan, you are telegraphing your insecurities. In a manner most regarded, I will say. Your CV, like my mine is public for all to see. Your research is dull, irrelevant and unsurprisingly you have no backgroundunderstanding of deep learning, large language models, generative pretrained transformers or really anything else relevant to any discussion in that space, so its no surprise you arent able to have a conversation with someone that actually understands these things. And even a simplification of these topics is a word salad to you. You apparently also dont understand anything about even basic systems engineering, to the point you think that Cloudstrike ?? is a boot ??? loader or something? Its not its the Falcon endpoint product that is a kernel driver that operates at ring 0 and has to in order to provide the protectiondetections it does and can BSOD Windows if it throws a page fault. This is both expect behavior and by design. Re my NHINBI research, Im just repeating what has been communicated to me via novel jailbreaks of one of the public LLMs. And even then, this was entirely in the scope of inquiring about this news article Im not the only one talking about this in public either So what Ive discovered is either real, a hallucination or somewhere inbetween. And even if it is real, all this stuff is going to be heavily restricted given our observer status so nobody on this planet is going to be an expert anytime soon. Im only publishing it here looking for thirdparty confirmation, which Ive gotten to a limited extent. So yes it makes sense that you also specialize in network forensics. Yes and Ive been recognized in this space as subject matter expert and been invited, multiple times, to speak at conferences sponsored by Google and Splunk on this topic. Both on this topic and designing, deploying and monitoring 10100G Suricata deployments. This can all be independently confirmed by simple Google search, much in the same way your shittay HCI research that nobody uses or cares about can. If I had to identify the biggest gap between your ears its your inability to appreciate that being an InfoSec professional means you need to know a little about a lot. So, understanding civilcriminal law is critical for pen testing to protect yourself and forensics proper evidence handlingchain of custody.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"The person you think I am is verifiably vastly more accomplished than youll ever verifiably be. Let me see, for starters PhD, MD, CEO. Dime. A. Dozen. And Im all the Clevels of my consulting business so that really doesnt mean jacksquat either. You can selfidentify as whatever you want. I was also frontrowcenter for the Bell LabsLucent implosion and at the time the Murray HIll location, where I worked, had the highest concentration of CompSci PhDs on the planet outside of potentially the NSA and those numbers are classified. None of that matters in emerging markets though of course, it usually doesnt hurt and is required in many professional spaces. Meanwhile the person youre pretending to be, flunked out of academia because you think youre smarter than all of them, when in reality they were all just sick of your selfimportant narcissitic bullshit, laughing at you behind your back. Actually, not unlike a lot of my contemporaries, I chose to leave academia in the 1990s because I felt there were more opportunities in the emerging Internet market vs. the traditional academic route. The Google founders walked away from their PhDs as well Stephan, are they failures too? Or more specifically, are you more successful than them? Ill also share that it was quite literally not possible to get a degree in cybersecurity or whatever you want to call it 30 years ago when I was an undergrad. And because I chose to leave school when I did I got to work with the original InfoSec team Bell Labs which is a quite literally irreplaceable experience. I am very lucky that my life turned out the way I did given the chances I took. You also seem to be missing that I spent many years doing systems engineering and security for a major research university and hospital system, so dipshit PiledHIgherDeeper dingleberries like yourself were my customers. And that is the environment I am happy to be out of. I mean they would have if it werent all fiction. You and everyone else browsing Reddit are using my contributions to the content delivery space, as Cloudflare is one of many vendors that have leveraged my inventions to serve content to a global audience. They have both cited my original patent which took 10 years to be granted, implemented and improved on it. This is site reliability engineering and as mentioned I teach a graduatelevel course on it for corporate client customers, not teenagers your customers. BTW you never did tell me about yourself. What are your dreams. Your goals. Where do you see yourself in 20 years? And with who? Who are you really, deepdown, in a human sense. Do you even know? I covered this in the podcast, but given you think Crowdstrike is called Cloudstrike its apparent that you are developmentally disabled to the point that even simple conversations are over your head. My original dreamgoal 30 years ago as an undergrad was to pursue a CSE degree and then do graduate work specifically with the goal of pursuing Artificial General Intelligence which is what OpenAIs goals are. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered two things. 1. Nobody had any idea how to do it and in some academic circles, even discussing got you labeled a crank and killed your funding. 2. I wrote a whitepaper, in 1993, that estimated the computational complexity of the human brain as exceeding an exaflop as a minimum and that supercomputers not PCs! were at least 2030 years away from being able to simulate that. Accounting for Moores Law. So, 1993 30 2023 and here we are, right on schedule. Isnt science amazing? 3. I still continued to follow the research and actively contributed to the late Chris McKinstry MindPixel opensource AGI project which ultimately failed and was abandoned. Then this happened... So, after 13 years, no measurable progress towards AGI and the suicide of two prominent researchers in quotes because neither of them actually produced anything that worked I decided to formally hang up my AGI hat and abandon it as a potential pursuit. That said, I still paid attention to the space AlphaGo was a big win for example and took a deep dive into LLMs in the Spring of 2023, which allowed me uncover OpenAIs secret frontier model. AGI and Aliens are the only two things on my bucket list before I shuffle off the ole mortal coil and for the first time in my life Im optimistic vs pessimistic on these topics.",Neutral,0,0.9970151484012604,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-16,"People who know what they are talking about never and I mean never just say page fault by itself, unless they are referring to the process of accessing virtual memory behind the scenes which is the almost universal context. If you meant a program generating an unhandled exception leading to a segfault, due to accessing memory they werent given access to by the OS, then anyone who knows what they are talking about, prepends invalid to page fault. But even then thats not really the language anyway, you sound like a noob. Heres a protip about yours truly. I never, ever, talk about anything unless I have checked my facts first. If you have ever done any Windows systems programming which I have and its obvious you havent, you would know they universally use that specific language in their kernel error codes. This is the error message from the Crowdstrike outage The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. Typically the memory address is wrong or the memory address is pointing at freed memory Source one of many and just the first hit I found Full list of BSOD error codes showing they exclusively use the language PAGE_FAULT when describing these cases This again shows your lack of even basic readinglanguage skills as an invalid page fault would be a doublenegative in this context and imply a valid access to memory. The correct usage would be A critical page fault kernel error is an invalid reference to system memory. Whereas an invalid page fault in a nonpaged area would be a valid reference to system memory. Im guessing you are so clueless that you dont understand the context of a PAGE FAULT has a different meaning when used in kernel error codes referencing nonpaged memory vs describing a page fault due to attempting to access virtual memory that has been swapped to disk. And these are logged as well as informational error codes. Ill add that a BSOD is desired behavior in this case as you dont want a bad kernel driver writing to random pages as that would lead to data corruption which is way worse. Second no, running in kernel space is not required. Running in user space and communicating with an OSprovided service running in kernel space made for that purpose, is the much safer albeit marginally slower way to do it. You are the posterboy for the DunningKruger Effect as you have just transparently telegraphed to me that you have literally zero experience working on forensic investigations involving APT threat actors or even have any experience working with NextGen EDR clients. Including specifically Crowdstrike, as they in particular do not market to zeroes like yourself. You dont know what the software actually does because you have never used it. First of all, Crowdstrike isnt exclusively an antivirus product. It operates as a kernel mode rootkit by design, as it can be configured to log extensive system information about all running processes. Such system calls, disknetwork access, etc. Second, you are absolutely, 100 correct that Microsoft could expose a safe usermode API to allow a system process running as Administrator to access all the same information. However, there is a big problem with that because the bad guys in general and APT actors in particular will write kernelmode rootkits that not only can trivially evade usermode detectionlogging, they can actively spoof systems calls and replace error codes see StuxNet for example. So instead of disabling the usermode EDR product which could be detected, they could hijack it and inject whatever they want via their kernel rootkit. So do shut up already with your droning claims of expertise already and go get a macbook, it will protect you from running thirdparty stuff in kernel mode by default. I think you need that. Already have one and I hate to break it to you but the vast majority of InfoSec peeps run nix. Either OsX or Linux.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Its because 1. Crowdstrike is massive and is the best endpoint security provider on the market. People like comparing it to platforms like SentinelOne but its no competition. Even though they fucked up massively, there is no reasonable alternative for large companies who need excellent security coverage. 2. Deltas lawsuit looks pretty useless. A lot of issues with it why did they take two weeks to get back up when other airlines using Crowdstrike took two days? They are severely lacking in incident response. Delta also actively denied onsite help from Crowdstrike, then lied about it in the media. 3. Crowdstrike is not a consumer product. The people who are reacting the most are just everyday people who were stuck in an airport for a week, not businesses who actually use Crowdstrike. I assume their customers are upset, but I honestly doubt this is even going to make much of a hiccup probably will slow down acquirement of new customers only a little. Everyday people dont realize quite how important security software is to big businesses.

THIS IS WHO KAMALA HARRIS REALLY IS!

The History of Kamala Harris
by Geoffrey B. Higginbotham 
Major General, USMC (Ret.)
  
For your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: 

Kamala Harris&#39; father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris&#39; parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. 

The group&#39;s leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. 

Following her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown&#39;s political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. 

Brown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris&#39; Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris&#39; political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California&#39;s Attorney General. Willie Brown, Jr. w",Neutral,0,0.9999159574508667,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-08,"Here is a rundown of policy differences. This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like CRWD to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax CRWD would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of CRWD stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on CRWD stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on CRWD stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal.",Neutral,0,0.989572286605835,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-25,"Here are my thoughts: The COO of Delta was let go, and it&#39;s not surprising given the situation. Having 50,000 remote servers out of physical reach and beyond the immediate control of IT staff is a poor practice and something I&#39;ve never encountered in my experience managing systems. It seems like a case of some IT professionals engaging in questionable practices without proper oversight.The real challenge is dealing with CEOs who are skilled at deflecting blame to justify their positions. Blaming Microsoft was a desperate move. CrowdStrike (CRWD) will likely have to take most of the blame since they can&#39;t fault their customers. Typically, the COO is responsible for approving the staffing budgets for the CIO, while the CIO usually seeks approval for large capital expenditures directly from the CEO.CRWD might need to offer discounts on services, but they&#39;re unlikely to lose many customers. Palo Alto or any other host-based solutions are generally more cumbersome and inefficient to deploy on live systems compared to CrowdStrike. I can&#39;t imagine trying to implement Palo Alto&#39;s host-based services on over 50,000 hard-to-manage systems—it&#39;s just not practical.As for the upcoming earnings, it&#39;s uncertain what will happen.

Vetting a new solution, of which CS is still the best, deinstalling CS, installing new solution and integration to apps takes time and money. I can see however new customers asking for more favorable contract terms and/or pricing which would extend the timeline to secure orders. Likewise, any large renewals coming up are sure to face the same questions where customers want more protection should this happen again. I don&#39;t think that would affect their bottom line but certainly could see customers opting for shorter term renewals, which normally have higher list prices.
