If youre not beating the SP then youre losing. Bear in mind that while youre sitting on cash waiting for the next piece of bad news, that money isnt appreciating like it would with a set it and forget it approach. Also every time one of your picks starts to plateau and you decide to sell you have to give the tax man his cut which means you have less to reinvest. If you have to sell before youve owned the stock for a year then youll have to pay capital gains which will cut into your profit even more. All these things plus the fact that there isnt a guarantee that a stock will bounce back from bad news means that this is probably not the slam dunk you think it is. You may get lucky a few times but its probably not a sustainable investing strategy."

Some would still not buy it at 220, it still had an astronomical PE at that point. But now it is 320, who cares about the pe you just missed a 45 gain. Its up 30 ytd. Also have you been to Costco? You could argue both of these particular stocks might be recession proof. Maybe that drives valuation."

Costco COST operates as a highvolume, lowmargin retailer. It has a stable, predictable cash flow, massive scale, and significant pricing power. The retail sector traditionally trades at lower multiples due to its lower growth potential compared to tech. CrowdStrike CRWD is a highgrowth cybersecurity company with a SaaS model. Its in a fastgrowing sector with a strong demand for cybersecurity, especially after recent highprofile breaches. Its high multiple reflects its future growth potential rather than current earnings. Based on the overvaluation of the market as you pointed out, plus intrinsic value vs value of the SP at 4080 depending on the metric you use, Buffet Indicator at 175 adjusted for inflation, equities should not be the priority for investing in this environment. yields bouncing around so quickly, the market is caught between worrying about inflation and worrying about recession. ratios SPYTLT, SPYGLD, etc. are showing the market is concerned with safe haven investments. the geopolitical issues, election year, debt ceiling in Jan. 2025 The obvious strategy as we see the market implementing is rotation into consumer staple equities, bonds, tbills, cash, KMLM, etc. Gold is useful but overvalued so that has to be factored in. And thats how Ive invested dodging gold until it pulls back and shortedinverse ETFs which I wouldnt recommend to anyone because its heavily risk tolerant dependant and not a lot of people have these ability to trade them well."

In other words, if a company is not growing and doesnt need to grow, it can return all of its earnings as dividends and outperform treasuries. Some companies do this and even let earnings go negative before cutting 5 dividends. Some people say that treasuries and the dollar are bombproof and safe investments, but that is not always true, especially regarding some of the points you made. You have to put your money somewhere, because the dollar hasnt gone up in value for a very long time, but trust me that gold and crypto are not safe havens if there is a real growth scare and market crash down the road and Ive been through many. Some of the mag 7 have good forward PE ratios, some will have higher forward PE ratios unless they can turn earnings around. I personally dont bet that a company is just about to turn the corner with the next report, even if marketunderperforming analysts are optimistic, but bet that fundamental growth trends will continue until there is evidence to the contrary. I would certainly agree that some stocks are overvalued, but that is always true. Right now, I think a lot of dubious nongrowing software and plebian semi stocks have caught AI tailwinds when they probably wont benefit from all the demonstrably increasing spend on transformer GPUs and ASICs. With your overbought metrics, you should remember that in a bull market, things can stay overbought for years, the same years you should be in the market. But, I am sitting on 20 cash right now, which is the most in the last two years, hoping to deploy it this month. In addition to lots of electionrelated uncertainty around the world, and typical geopolitical risks, Im nervous about Israels response to Iran because the military leaders are making really ominous noises. Their proxy war has been ugly, but not nearly as ugly as it could be. Irans leaders could be delusional enough to launch missiles at Arab oil production and rain a lot more missiles down on cities than they have so far. In this case, Im not betting on cooler heads to suddenly prevail, because escalation is the apparent trend. Ill be glad if Im wrong, having missed out on some gains by briefly holding insurance and dry powder, but any appreciable selloff is an entry point for me. Over the next two years, I think interest rates are coming down. If they dont, economic and earnings growth will probably be the culprit, which is probably fine for stocks. It doesnt make sense to me for the Fed funds rate to be higher than the inflation rate for long periods of time, and it is right now. Stocks will crash in the future, but they will crash when companies dramatically decrease spending, which hasnt happened yet. Let me know when that happens. In a recession, companies cut spending by a lot, and the percent increase in unemployment and decrease in household spending usually doesnt compare. I think the scariest crashes happen when interest rates are low, because the Fed doesnt have as much ammo, and companies are more likely to have loaded up on debt that they think they can cheaply finance, until they cant."

For example, you get a security system for your house, it gets hacked and someone breaks in and steals all your valuables. Here, the system failed to do the one thing its supposed to do. If that same system malfunctioned, locking you out of your house, sure thats also a big problem but at the end of the day, your valuables were still protected. So while yes, there were costly, global impacts to operations, this wasnt a largescale data lossbreach which Id argue has a bigger impact to reputation and operations than the outage. I personally dont think this kind of mistake ever happens again, and this incident shined a spotlight on weaknesses in organizations ability to execute effective contingency plans to remain operational"

The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years. Why do you think it ran up? It still hasnt lost the daily uptrend and it has retained tremendous growth after doubling in value."

Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way."

Any business that has systems should have prepared for how they would respond to any kind of event, be it a cyber attack or physical disaster or anything else. You classify these events and have plans of how youll recover or replace each system. Sometimes the recovery plan is less than ideal, but you make that decision informed and as a cost versus risk choice. Some many will choose to take more profits rather than have people on payroll that can reset servers or administer bitlocker. Theyre rolling the dice and hoping that shortcut doesnt come back on them. Ive had times when other executives said how come youre spending so much to have two power utilities, and if you have two power utilities why do you also have your own power generation, couldnt we save money by ditching some of this?

You dont want some internal testing team pausing your live sports broadcast or weather report or market pricing so they can test it first. And the same could be true with cyber protection. Do you want delays to fresh and ongoing exploit protection? Probably not. If given a choice, which would you pick delay and do extra tests, but be vulnerable to zero day malware, ransomware, data theft, data corruption, code corruption, infection, and other cyber damage dont delay, but be vulnerable to having your IT operations perform a straight forward and well rehearsed reboot of each system Even in hindsight, its a pretty obvious choice."

The file that broke the host machines was not code per se in the classic sense it didnt change the software installed on the machine but rather it was more equivalent to a config file. I can guarantee that most companies ship similar config files to their hosts without testing. Its A LOT of work to add staggered publications for every file possible associated with a product. In an everyday sense, its almost similar to how journalists dont necessarily fully proofread their documents before sending them to their editors. If a file reader the editor used happened to have a bug that couldnt read the file correctly, the software breaks. In this case, it had devastating consequences but not because of negligence that differed from the industry standard, but rather because of a bug they didnt fully prepare for. All software has bugs and bugs make it out to production every day. Any publishersubscriber system is extremely hard to test in a staggered fashion. Have you noticed that test amber alerts are sent to EVERYONE, rather than just a couple of phones? Sending out config files typically doesnt follow the classical software validation system of canaries and test environments. You just have subscribers that receive it and you hope that the code that reads the messages correctly processes it. It sounds like Crowdstrike is indeed currently implementing systems where these files are rolled out in a staggered fashion, but its not going to be a simple process. Sounds like theyre going to become one of the companies with the highest standards of QA in the industry after this event."

And its also a gap in their testing. But they have described the multiple steps they do in testing, which are decent, but as weve learned, ultimately imperfect. The testing needs to be bolstered to catch this kind of failure mode, and now it is. But for those armchair experts who have been claiming they do zero or no testing, thats just false.

If you gave me the job, and I could tap into Facebooks billions upon billions of profit, Id create a gold plated super high quality and integrity moderating system.

But if you leave the damage unfixed, and then the wood rots, and you fail to deal with that, and then the fence topples onto your dog house, and then you dont do anything about that either and eventually the dog house gives way and squashes your dog, well under the law Im not responsible for your dog, your dog house or your fence. Im only responsible from for the initial scratch, and whatever is is reasonable to cure that specific harm. You have whats called a duty to mitigate, which means taking action to make sure the scratch doesnt lead to other consequences. Thats precisely the concept at play here. Crowdstrike was responsible for the initial issue. If a customer lost money or incurred costs during the 2 hour initial period before Crowdstrike issued the workaround instructions, thats fair. If a customer had to pay someone overtime, or a minimum 4 hour call out charge. Or travel and expense, those are in bounds. But beyond that, it shifts to customers duty to mitigate.

As long as you can buy fractional shares of individual stocks it works. The key to dollar cost averaging is being able to buy fractional shares so the full amount of the equal periodic payment is used to buy the security, with no leftover money uninvested. Dollar cost averaging began with mutual funds, which are always sold as fractional shares. x200B and I dont know if its wise doing my personal in SP as well Nothing wrong with going all index funds in all of your accounts, especially if you have a history of being lured into making illadvised individual stock picks. However, if you like investing in individual stocks, as do I, I made a spreadsheet of 134 dividendpaying SP 500 index stocks that have beaten the SP 500 index since 1993 or since the stocks IPO if it was after 1993. Since these are dividendpaying SP 500 stocks they are unlikely to behave like some of the duds you picked in the past, but past performance doesnt guarantee future results, blah blah blah. Have fun looking through the spreadsheet, I found some hidden gems in there."

Markets also take a lot longer to top than to bottom, largely because a lot of people see the valuation problem and try to short while flows are still positive. If you cant get involved in the trend, fine at least dont fight it. Better to wait for the dominant flows to turn negative before shorting a good trader hopes only to catch the middle of the move."

Many younger investors especially dont seem to know what it was like to essentially have a decade of no returns 2000 to 2010, or 1965 to 1983. Over the past 80 years of the stock market there have been several periods like this. Based on history it seems we are likely due for another period at some point of low returns. Like COVID no one can predict the exact event that will cause sentiment to change. As far as reasons why the stock market might not be overvalued 1 AI efficiencies become realized, 2 PE multiple expansion, due to more demand to invest in assets older people with retirement funds, more younger people saving, 3 tied with 2 a bit, the stock market may just be the best alternative available.

But this regard and many others didnt know about them all these years because there were no major bad news from them, quite the opposite. I got some groundbreaking news for you literally every developed country is in mountains of debt The EU countries have surpassed debt that is 100 of their GDP years ago, some even 200 and dont even mention Greece China recently announced that they would increase their debt even further.

No one cares about valuation while the music is playing, and the street and buy side careers depend on on the fact you stay in it and play the game. Law of averages tell you over long periods something does occur and a discernible pattern emerges but is irrelevant if you are making short term decisions at the moment tick by tick with your life savings. Valuations can give you a picture but not the answer, and typically most utilized when attempting to explain something in hindsight, most times long after time to take action has passed. All this is occurring in time with the emergence and dominance of quantitative strategies in equities seems more than spurious to me. Thats why nobody makes money consistently long term just based on predicting the markets anymore, if ever. E.g. Lynch leveraged his massive mutual fund to game the market and manipulate his holdings to his favor while Buffets track record from pure stock picking has not been as good as the good old days when asymmetric info could be found by obsessive stock hounds."

Yamz in canada is a new stock which pays GOOD monthly dividends monthly and its a CAD hedged to the amazon stock, so its ALSO a growth stock. Literally Overpowered. Enb is a gas pipeline stock which just completed a big pipeline project recently and increases its dividend per share very often, and its quarterly. I bought way before the completion and in the last 12 months i began to buy it at the low end, the dividend rate went up twice i think, and my value from avg is 24 up rn. I have 93 stocks for enb and every quarter i basically get another 1.5 stocks its at 56 and slowly climbing Then i have HAZ in canada. Growth stock based on global markets. Its reletively new and im up 12 i think in 7 months i owned it? Its all big more reliable compabies too. This is my canuckistani take.

Every developed economy save for SK is broke off its ass in terms of debt to GDP. Between demographic shortfalls, resource shortages, pollution, etc, there are no serious prospects for growth rates to catch back up. What future catalyst or technology will make the world more productive in 10 years than it is today? Chatbots? Every developed nation is thus pretty much bankrupt, and is implicity defaulting via currency inflation. Thats why stocks are running, and will keep running for a while. Any cashflowing asset that can keep up with inflation, is going to get pushed up with inflation. And I think inflation is going to be very persistent. Nothing lasts forever, and one day this trend will break down. My guess is what breaks it will be a major European sovereign debt crisis by around 2030. Think France going down rather than Greece. Productive capital will flee Europe, likely to America, and bond buyers will shit themselves and start demanding higher yields from already desperately broke governments. Where we go from there, I dont know. I really want to see how the whole growth goes up forever meme blows up and unwinds in the 21st and 22nd centuries, but Im not going to live long enough to see it all through.

The US dollar collapses or the government reduces spending and increases taxes seems unlikely, hard to get any votes this way. Either way it seems to me that this event will cause a market crash, however, I do understand that the USD isnt really comparable to other currencies and if anyone has any other alternative scenarios I would love to hear them. Because of this my current asset allocation is 50 fixed income, and the other 50 stocks. Within the stocks about half is in the US with an equal amount of long and short positions removing the risk of a crash or continued bull market and the other 50 is predominantly in China where great investment opportunities are abundant even when considering the risks which I think are overestimated. I also hedged all my USD in Swiss francs, but closed that position due to high fees, might buy a Swiss bond ETF when I have more cash on hand"

We have a k shaped economy that is growing a larger number of struggling people. If you are a trader, who gives a damn, go make money. If you are an investor, macro is showing some serious warning signs. I would say everything will go swimmingly until there is some kind of surprise like... 1. Jobs report revision its total BS 2. Private credit crunch dumb money disaster 3. WWIII huge correction due to the vast amount of investment in index funds and reallocated assets based on weight. auto sell. America wont default. We will just print. Long term, equities will make you absolutely rich. Dont forget, Japan is still surviving and the U.S. runs the world. I got out mostly in July and Im allocated 10 gold, 10 oilnatural resources 80 cash until post election and Middle East easing. A 5 almost risk free for six months or so wont hurt me. Then Im 80 equities and 20 gold probably February. So yeah, thats my prediction. Im open to being nimble, ready to pounce with a fist full of cash. But as far as trading, go trade. Make money."

That means we have trillions of dollars distorting capital markets across the world. Everything is extremely overpriced. Eg real estate is in most countries above the price where the median salary can afford it. Additionally the vast majority of this printed money has been given to large corporations, banks and the UHNW. This means that the people holding the money supply dont need to actually use it for consumption, its purely going towards investments and asset classes. Theres nowhere else for this money to go, and it keeps being printed. Were practically in a neofeudal society, the value of labour vs capital is worse than it was prior to the Great Depression but the financial markets have been successfully disconnected to reality, compared to back then. The only thing that can happen in the long term is a credit shock on the dollar, that is to say that a large range of investors into US treasuries and dollars stop buying and using them which isnt going to happen anytime soon because a failed USD would fail the entire global financial markets at the same time. Its a Ponzi scheme that needs to keep running off the backs of future generations. The other thing that can happen is a socialist revolution in various parts of the world that would lead to a massive shock in how secure economic assets are considered to be by investors. Right now the belief amongst banks and everyone else is that the world is capitalist and theres no way a country risks its economic future by not putting investors first. Challenging that perception could lead to definancialisation in a lot of sectors."

None of us will know when the next crash is happening. The ones that saw it coming will have been just plain lucky. And the ones that saw it coming a year ago will have lost out on major gains. Its pointless to think about, just like your statement above."

Not only are we seeing growth numbers that people would not believe had they happened decades ago, but those numbers are coming from huge companies that in the past would not be growing and instead just be a blue chip dividend stock. And its all driven by earnings growth. We had a pretty sizeable dump in 2022. People were calling for the end times financially. It passed, we addressed it and moved on. The price of everything you could say is overvalued right now. Food, gas, housing, etc. I dont see why stocks would be immune to that. Growth will eventually slow, but not while ai is causing a ton of industry disruption. Id say its more likely were in the early stages of a multi year boom cycle. Well have corrective months, and those might reset some companies to normal growth levels, but I dont think well have a down year for some time."

What you call earnings, for us, was just investors relations IR telling us what the shareholders wanted their EPS to be as you can before filing a paper to the regulator simply modify your earnings to what the shareholders wanted. EPS is just an easily modified variable with no meaning. Check Truist Financial they sold a fire sale tactic aka drop your most profitable entity to ensure that even tho your dead in the water you still show inflated earnings. But you didnt earn anything. All you did was selling what you had. And companies arent making record profits. Not based on yield out of products out of revenue. Earnings come out of selling stuff off, or cutting employees which flips a loss into a profit. Doesnt change intrinsically that the firm is still bleeding money. Beyond Meat, Lyft, Peloton, Doordash, all are good examples. Earnings isnt debt restructuring. Debt isnt growth. Is extending the inevitable ever more expensive bill that will come eventually. Hence firms like Beyond Meat will die as they issued a huge debt and the redemption date is coming and they are loss making already no way they can pay that back. We finally get rid of the firms who solely lived on the regime of low interest rate and used that iteratively in loops to restructure their debt to keep liquidity while their actual product became less and less profitable. And the labor market is strong? Based on what? What the government says? Or their metrics? Since when did the government save us from disasters or recessions or anything else? last time I checked their so called governing of how healthy everything is during the mortgage crash. The IT crash. Etc never helped. So why trust a pattern that veils itself as we are safe yet all other recessions the government had it wrong? I dont know you yell me. This isnt a conspiracy this is simply stories in a history book of last recessions. And that pattern is there once more. Not that some firms arent truthfully growing some are Im long in some value stocks who I absolutely believe in but the majority is dead in the water. Because I dont comprehend when a firm is loss making. Has more debt than ever and debt one day has to be repaid. How on earth they will be able to afford it? They cant make new products no money they cant issue more debt because the yield will be higher crushing the margins on their own product line. Do explain please because I dont have an answer.

The main victim so to speak is the younger generations, especially those who do not have inheritances or assets be it properties or stocks. But as you can see from what they protests about Palestine, Black Lives Matter, inclusion, lgbtq, etc they are only really literate on sociopolitical issues du jour and are not able to identify, and respond adequately to the socioeconomic issues. The problem described here is far beyond the intellectual awareness of the vast majority of the younger generations, so they dont get angry they just become shitty workers who dont care because theyre not paid enough to care. Theyre also not able to afford having families, houses, etc. The lie down movement in china is very much similar across the world in how younger generations are acting out in regards to their personal hopeless economic situations. This also means that there isnt enough political pressure to fix this, because the majority of boomers and older gen X benefit as well as literally anybody whose parents had good investments or assets. If your parents like mine didnt invest properly or successfully, you are sort of fucked unless you are a 1million entrepreneur or working in a ultra high demand industry like tech and are in a top position there. 401k system actually strongly benefits the USA overall in comparison to much of the world because it made a big proportion of the population benefit from the stock market and also made the us stock market much better return than others. It is essentially a Ponzi scheme because if there isnt more printed money or new entrants it wont deliver as high returns but right now this wont be likely to stop. Theres a few other countries such as Norway which also benefited due to a conscious strategy of investing in stocks and other high growth asset classes. Hence the most likely challenge to the current status quo will be major black swan events leading to radical capital outflows due to perceived high risk. A china us war may be one such event, but even that will be unlikely to actually lead to all that money being taken out of financial markets. More likely is that there will be a challenge to the power of capital assets by a coalition of countries. Eg eurasia including EU may institute capital controls like pre 1950s if they find that too much of their economies end up under random foreign controls or foreign ownership of productive assets."

Like if you spend more but lower taxes. You debt goes up. So if buy your debt, I obviously want a higher return because you are going to earn less. But for short term its soothing words for society. Back to the history books. Delusional leaders lead a country into further polarization. If I trust what history tells us thats how most, not all either civil war contained in a country or all out war. Its not me trying to convince anyone its basically repeating the patterns of history books we all got taught as kids. With simple logical patterns. If we get a new leader A or B. Well, history tells us they always want to quickly show something unknown unknown. To mark their territory. Regardless A or B. Problem is towards the elections the polarization is absolutely maddening. Left is extreme left, right is extreme right. Populism is easy speak to your voters what they wanna hear even if not economically viable so I hope regardless A or B elected they dont do more short term thinking. More spending for jobs to keep people happy short term By issuing more debt and more and more.. It works. Short term. Eventually a new generation will have to carry an immense burden. Im not left or right, I see it as a circle, walk long enough from left, you become a centralist to a right back to central. So for me I just focus on are the new A or B going to continue short sighted thinking dropping further opportunities for kids yet to come. Because hedge funds and banks arent that dumb, if you spend more than you earn, youll have to pay back more. Supply pool of voters are blissfully unaware but hedge funds and banks are not they see free cash. And I dont like it. Screwing further generations by short term thinking and short cuts to keep the electoral population happy. It works now, not the next few years. All I can say fingers crossed, Im an ex institutional trader since 99 and eventually headed a front office team in a large bank. All I can say Ive seen this pattern or loop over and over and over again. We all know who gets hurt the most. The people who work the hardest, safe the most cash is trash, and are good polite people who lack financial literacy. The people who carry the country as always will get the heaviest burden. Cest la vie. Im not TOO concerned which marionet governs, Im far more concerned about applying short term economical plans who help us short term but x100 screw us years later."

The crash would happen with the following months after that party. Prices were crazy, gas was at an alltime high, grocers kept blaming everything including mild weather for raising prices. It turned out to be a contagion of greed instead. Old Warren had said , fearful when others are greedy.... It was terrifying to see it as a mature adult. Id like to be wrong about this and so far I have been for the last couple of years. How do you feel about any possible corrections and what measures should us NoFi no finance education people take?

And this is exactly why I know your answering the wrong question. I have far more interest in your worst losses in face value lets say 25 trades since inception than overall performance.

I could be wrong about how well they are doing, but puts are my gut reaction. edit also their security or store procedures suck dick. some old lady was able to buy a pair of shoes using my card. and I had to track her down and have kohls investigate etc. and It was probably just some dumb employee that looked up the wrong name in store and charged it to my card because Sears used to have that issue also."

There is a metric to options, several actually, but one in particular called implied volatility IV for short. Iv plays a factor into options price, and iv is driven by expected events that would drive market price. Earnings is a big one, dates of known contract announcements or company announcements. The market knows all of this and tracks it through IV. The closer you get to these events, the IV will rise, causing the price of an option to rise with it. So by buying options for known events as far away from them as you can stomach, the cheaper you can get that same option for. You have to balance that with how much you think the price will change before that event though. Options are simple yet complicated. So if you buy an option today for earnings tomorrow, it will likely be as expensive as that option gets. Starting the moment the event happens, the iv begins to drop dramatically, lowering the price of the option. This is known as iv crush if you have heard that term used."

But if you look at QoQ, QoQ revenue growth rate has been slowing QoQ revenue growth was 15, which is a lowering percentage that previous QoQ growths not Nvidias fault... its just that the law of large numbers is a bitch. Now that we got that out of the way. Heres some issues Their current margins are about as good as they can get... they can likely only get slightly better by a hair going forward, but there is more room for the downside to get substantially worse. Cyclicality. Any company that sells hardware, where a small concentrated customer base accounts for a large portion of their earnings, is prone to cyclical boom and busts. If Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla decide to not increase their spending on AI GPUs that much more from here or cut back on it, then RIP Nvidia. Following the previous point, why would they possibly not increase their spending that much more or even cut it? Because for the 100200 billion or so being spent on this crap, very little money is being made. OpenAI only made like 3 Billion in annual revenue.

They absolutely fit the Clevel dream model of Cut a vendor a check and forget about it. Re the recent outage something critical to note is that both Crowdstrike and Microsoft were completely transparent regarding the outage, while Delta was not. This very much displays the sort of culture these companies have when managing risk. Ive used SentinelOne, but my experience with it is if you are doing any sort of development work on machines with it installed it will trigger false positives constantly. So the devs end up disabling it and you lose coverage in some of your most critical areas. PaloAlto is ok but you need to buy into their ecosystem. No opinion on Fortinet."

But with the outage, my only skepticism is whether this will put customers who dont already have a cybersecurity software away from Crowdstrike and end up choosing to go with a competitor purely because of the bad rep at the moment. That then slows growth during the aftermath period and without the crazy growth the price should in theory tank like fuck going by its current PE ratio.

And even if it is real, all this stuff is going to be heavily restricted given our observer status so nobody on this planet is going to be an expert anytime soon.

I was also frontrowcenter for the Bell LabsLucent implosion and at the time the Murray HIll location, where I worked, had the highest concentration of CompSci PhDs on the planet outside of potentially the NSA and those numbers are classified. None of that matters in emerging markets though of course, it usually doesnt hurt and is required in many professional spaces. Meanwhile the person youre pretending to be, flunked out of academia because you think youre smarter than all of them, when in reality they were all just sick of your selfimportant narcissitic bullshit, laughing at you behind your back. Actually, not unlike a lot of my contemporaries, I chose to leave academia in the 1990s because I felt there were more opportunities in the emerging Internet market vs. the traditional academic route. The Google founders walked away from their PhDs as well Stephan, are they failures too? Or more specifically, are you more successful than them? Ill also share that it was quite literally not possible to get a degree in cybersecurity or whatever you want to call it 30 years ago when I was an undergrad. And because I chose to leave school when I did I got to work with the original InfoSec team Bell Labs which is a quite literally irreplaceable experience. I am very lucky that my life turned out the way I did given the chances I took. You also seem to be missing that I spent many years doing systems engineering and security for a major research university and hospital system, so dipshit PiledHIgherDeeper dingleberries like yourself were my customers. And that is the environment I am happy to be out of. I mean they would have if it werent all fiction. You and everyone else browsing Reddit are using my contributions to the content delivery space, as Cloudflare is one of many vendors that have leveraged my inventions to serve content to a global audience. They have both cited my original patent which took 10 years to be granted, implemented and improved on it.

What are your dreams. Your goals. Where do you see yourself in 20 years? And with who? Who are you really, deepdown, in a human sense. Do you even know? I covered this in the podcast, but given you think Crowdstrike is called Cloudstrike its apparent that you are developmentally disabled to the point that even simple conversations are over your head. My original dreamgoal 30 years ago as an undergrad was to pursue a CSE degree and then do graduate work specifically with the goal of pursuing Artificial General Intelligence which is what OpenAIs goals are. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered two things. 1. Nobody had any idea how to do it and in some academic circles, even discussing got you labeled a crank and killed your funding. 2. I wrote a whitepaper, in 1993, that estimated the computational complexity of the human brain as exceeding an exaflop as a minimum and that supercomputers not PCs! were at least 2030 years away from being able to simulate that. Accounting for Moores Law. So, 1993 30 2023 and here we are, right on schedule. Isnt science amazing? 3. I still continued to follow the research and actively contributed to the late Chris McKinstry MindPixel opensource AGI project which ultimately failed and was abandoned. Then this happened... So, after 13 years, no measurable progress towards AGI and the suicide of two prominent researchers in quotes because neither of them actually produced anything that worked I decided to formally hang up my AGI hat and abandon it as a potential pursuit. That said, I still paid attention to the space AlphaGo was a big win for example and took a deep dive into LLMs in the Spring of 2023, which allowed me uncover OpenAIs secret frontier model. AGI and Aliens are the only two things on my bucket list before I shuffle off the ole mortal coil and for the first time in my life Im optimistic vs pessimistic on these topics."

                    "text": "People who know what they are talking about never and I mean never just say page fault by itself, unless they are referring to the process of accessing virtual memory behind the scenes which is the almost universal context. If you meant a program generating an unhandled exception leading to a segfault, due to accessing memory they werent given access to by the OS, then anyone who knows what they are talking about, prepends invalid to page fault. But even then thats not really the language anyway, you sound like a noob. Heres a protip about yours truly. I never, ever, talk about anything unless I have checked my facts first. If you have ever done any Windows systems programming which I have and its obvious you havent, you would know they universally use that specific language in their kernel error codes. This is the error message from the Crowdstrike outage The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. Typically the memory address is wrong or the memory address is pointing at freed memory Source one of many and just the first hit I found Full list of BSOD error codes showing they exclusively use the language PAGE_FAULT when describing these cases This again shows your lack of even basic readinglanguage skills as an invalid page fault would be a doublenegative in this context and imply a valid access to memory. The correct usage would be A critical page fault kernel error is an invalid reference to system memory. Whereas an invalid page fault in a nonpaged area would be a valid reference to system memory. Im guessing you are so clueless that you dont understand the context of a PAGE FAULT has a different meaning when used in kernel error codes referencing nonpaged memory vs describing a page fault due to attempting to access virtual memory that has been swapped to disk. And these are logged as well as informational error codes. Ill add that a BSOD is desired behavior in this case as you dont want a bad kernel driver writing to random pages as that would lead to data corruption which is way worse. Second no, running in kernel space is not required. Running in user space and communicating with an OSprovided service running in kernel space made for that purpose, is the much safer albeit marginally slower way to do it. You are the posterboy for the DunningKruger Effect as you have just transparently telegraphed to me that you have literally zero experience working on forensic investigations involving APT threat actors or even have any experience working with NextGen EDR clients. Including specifically Crowdstrike, as they in particular do not market to zeroes like yourself. You dont know what the software actually does because you have never used it. First of all, Crowdstrike isnt exclusively an antivirus product. It operates as a kernel mode rootkit by design, as it can be configured to log extensive system information about all running processes. Such system calls, disknetwork access, etc. Second, you are absolutely, 100 correct that Microsoft could expose a safe usermode API to allow a system process running as Administrator to access all the same information. However, there is a big problem with that because the bad guys in general and APT actors in particular will write kernelmode rootkits that not only can trivially evade usermode detectionlogging, they can actively spoof systems calls and replace error codes see StuxNet for example. So instead of disabling the usermode EDR product which could be detected, they could hijack it and inject whatever they want via their kernel rootkit. So do shut up already with your droning claims of expertise already and go get a macbook, it will protect you from running thirdparty stuff in kernel mode by default. I think you need that. Already have one and I hate to break it to you but the vast majority of InfoSec peeps run nix. Either OsX or Linux. I have a windows gaming laptop, which is fine, but I dont use it for anything other than entertainment."

How the market can see a global crash, worse than 1987, and then pump all day is beyond me, but it happened. It doesnt matter that CRWD is overbought and trading at 10x its expected value. What matters is alot of big players are invested in that ticker, and until enough of them decide the price is too high, or something else rocks the boat enough to shake some of them out, its staying overbought No sense in trying to fight the market, youll just go broke. If some big lawsuits start making the news Id expect it to drop again, and might buy puts then. Ill strongly consider playing earnings, they should miss guidance and seems like a good bet, but who knows, thats still a couple months away. Because this stock is so overbought itll be one of the first casualties whenever we get a crash again. Its a balloon that will eventually pop. No way to know when that is, but Ill keep my eyes on this stock if Im still trading when we have the next 2008 or 1987. Until then a short position just doesnt seem profitable, Im out."

Lets say you have a friend who has always been very reliable in college and has helped you pass every class. One day, heshe fucks up massively and accidentally causes you to flunk out of college. Youre pissed as fuck. Your friend apologises, but you find his apology insufficient. However, he keeps working with you, keeps trying everything he can to rectify the situation, teaches you new skills. With the new skills youve developed, you get an offer for a 200k job. Suddenly youre not mad anymore and instead laughing about it Hey, remember the time you flunked me out of college? The company is like the friend. Its been tremendously reliable compared to its competitors. Best product on the market. Additionally, theyre fixing everything they can to prevent something like this from happening again. Theyve taken responsibility. By the end of their changes, they probably will have close to a foolproof solution that far exceeds their competitors QA. If their customers are rational, why would they switch? Seems like they might lose Delta as a customer, but Delta seems like a terribly emotional friend who cant let go of the past. Most people forgive and forget after their new demands have been met. Plus, the company has most likely prevented hundreds of major breaches for most of its major customers. A single 2hr to 2day outage isnt all that significant compared to how many saves theyve probably made."

People like comparing it to platforms like SentinelOne but its no competition. Even though they fucked up massively, there is no reasonable alternative for large companies who need excellent security coverage. 2. Deltas lawsuit looks pretty useless. A lot of issues with it why did they take two weeks to get back up when other airlines using Crowdstrike took two days? They are severely lacking in incident response. Delta also actively denied onsite help from Crowdstrike, then lied about it in the media. 3. Crowdstrike is not a consumer product. The people who are reacting the most are just everyday people who were stuck in an airport for a week, not businesses who actually use Crowdstrike. I assume their customers are upset, but I honestly doubt this is even going to make much of a hiccup probably will slow down acquirement of new customers only a little. Everyday people dont realize quite how important security software is to big businesses. Like, it doesnt REALLY matter if you dont add a malware detector on your personal laptop, but it means everything to businesses."

More like best performing airline operating on bandaid system.CRWD reached out to Delta within hours of software release offering to help but were told Delta will get back to them.  Then were told too little too late four days later.Delta board member David Dewalt commented on Linked in that CRWD provided incredible technical support.$500 million in damage is a drop in the bucket that these companies eat for lunch.

Think about it Sales = Earnings / Profit Margin so Earnings = Sales * Profit Margin. If both factors rise at the same time, the earnings growth is multiplicative and non-linear (potentially exponential if the demand is rising while prices are also rising similar to what happened to Apple). Thus, you can&#39;t use a linear valuation metric like P/E Ratio to measure a non-linear change in earnings. Of course, there are many implied ways to obtain valuations, but why in the world would I tell you that."

Higginbotham \nMajor General, USMC (Ret.)\n  \nFor your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: \n\nKamala Harris&#39; father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris&#39; parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. \n\nThe group&#39;s leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. \n\nFollowing her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown&#39;s political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. \n\nBrown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris&#39; Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris&#39; political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California&#39;s Attorney General.

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like CRWD to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax CRWD would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of CRWD stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on CRWD stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on CRWD stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."

This transfers actions of update to the customer. Put a deployment wizard on the module at install, allowing customer IT Staff the option of choosing &#34;Auto Update&#34; or Manual Module Approval &#34;Apply and Never Ask This Again in ORG Unit&#34;. Also, bounds check before committing: &#34;If: module_exists Then: run_action Else: error_stop_update&#34;Delta: You have 50 Thousand Servers, IT has left running like feral cats.

Having 50,000 remote servers out of physical reach and beyond the immediate control of IT staff is a poor practice and something I&#39;ve never encountered in my experience managing systems. It seems like a case of some IT professionals engaging in questionable practices without proper oversight.The real challenge is dealing with CEOs who are skilled at deflecting blame to justify their positions. Blaming Microsoft was a desperate move. CrowdStrike (CRWD) will likely have to take most of the blame since they can&#39;t fault their customers. Typically, the COO is responsible for approving the staffing budgets for the CIO, while the CIO usually seeks approval for large capital expenditures directly from the CEO.CRWD might need to offer discounts on services, but they&#39;re unlikely to lose many customers. Palo Alto or any other host-based solutions are generally more cumbersome and inefficient to deploy on live systems compared to CrowdStrike. I can&#39;t imagine trying to implement Palo Alto&#39;s host-based services on over 50,000 hard-to-manage systems—it&#39;s just not practical.As for the upcoming earnings, it&#39;s uncertain what will happen. However, in the long term, I&#39;m not worried about CRWD. Most analysts believe the stock has already bottomed out. Best of luck to all CRWD longs!"

Crowd is offering discounts and added value to clients. It wont stop clients from moving over to Palo Alto or Fort anyway, just keeps it quiet. The problem is how it will all effect revenue and earnings over the next year. We won’t actually see the result of it all until then. In that time Palo and Fort and others might grab more market share. I’m reducing my position and adding others depending on their earnings. I think playing your position similar to their clients is the only empirical way to go without forthcoming earnings reports Imho. Thoughts?"

I can see however new customers asking for more favorable contract terms and/or pricing which would extend the timeline to secure orders. Likewise, any large renewals coming up are sure to face the same questions where customers want more protection should this happen again. I don&#39;t think that would affect their bottom line but certainly could see customers opting for shorter term renewals, which normally have higher list prices. I also think this event will be a distant memory in a year."

Ask yourself the following:What is my holding timeframe?  Weeks/months/years?What is my risk tolerance?  Am I able to tolerate large swings in share price?Do I make decisions objectively, or do I tend to be ruled by my emotions?If you find yourself in need of frequent emotional reassurance in order to feel OK about owning a stock, I would advise either reducing the position size or selling it for that reason alone.  It&#39;s likely a sign that the stock does not fit well with your personal risk tolerance.I fully expect CRWD to reach and surpass 380 within 2 years, but it won&#39;t be a straight line getting there.  The earnings call on 8/28 will undoubtedly have an impact one way or another as investors look carefully at what the company says about customer subscriptions and forward guidance.

The reports from Blackhat are that people are rallying around CS and their phenomenal response and ability to push out a fix.   These things happen and I’m down 7 figures and sticking with them.  They are the best in the business.   I believe the earnings call will show great growth for the prior quarter.  Guidance for future quarter will be hard to determine.

Software companies know they will break things with untested updates and this will be likely seen as blatant negligence by the courts and any contract indemnifications will be thrown out in court.They can spin false news stories,  like fake buyouts which they did on Peloton when it was crashing at around 30-40/share to lift it up to make puts go to zero , or just spin a new narrative like they are trying here. It won&#39;t end up well, but they price options so they make the money on premiums in the mean time, because they know  people will bet on it, and lose on any otm options, all the while common folk in their retirement funds hold the bag in regular shares....Pton is at 3 bucks a share now, since the buyout rumors at 30ish a share....This is the modern market."

Of course they had to get an attorney and rattle swords. Some high level positions are at stake here.

While it’s just a war of words at the moment, if Delta continues to pursue legal action, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a defamation counter-suit being penned by Microsoft’s many, many lawyers.&#34;"

At one point they insisted I had made my flight from Atlanta to Seattle despite the fact that we arrived after our connection departed (never mind the fact I was standing in front of them with my partner to get rebooked). Hours online with CS and I was given a new booking for the morning. Nope. Still showed up as having arrived the day before. Got rolled on standby repeatedly. \n\nA previous trip with my daughters we got stuck in Detroit coming and going. Ended up spending the night in Detroit and then booked on two different flights simultaneously receiving boarding notifications for both. Delta PR blamed it on the weather but staff told us it was due to pilot walkout/shortages and pilots in interviews confirmed that in the media."

Divide it up into 3rds and buy WEN the next 3 days.Often I&#39;d sell a few weeks later for a nice return, rinse and repeat in a non-taxable account.Did the same with TYC options every time Koslowski would be in the news for a dumb move I&#39;d add some calls and/or leaps often the next day, cheap like 2-3.00 and they&#39;d often double or more in a week or so.  At the same time my customer was trading AMD back in the day it was under 10 forever it seemed under old CEO.  I want to say maybe in the 4&#39;s occasionally getting in to the 5&#39;s?When the markets opened after 9/11 I bought BA with all my cash.

Their software error was only on Windows. This would also explain why Delta did not accept help from CrowdStrike either.So that $500 million lawsuit threat is nothing but a maneuver to distract Delta shareholders."

Testing infrastructure in particular is the result of a history of many decisions made by multiple people and teams over many years for a company of CrowdStrike&#39;s size.Based on the preliminary incident report, the release of a serious error seems to be the compound effect of multiple deficiencies in the testing and release infrastructure plus the interaction of software components likely maintained by different teams.  Latter is a conclusion drawn by the observation that kernel-level coders are unlikely to also maintain file content validators for content being downloaded from a server to a client.There is plenty of blame to go around, and it&#39;s hard to see how firing a few specific individuals would improve matters unless there is clear gross negligence with respect to an individual&#39;s area of responsibility.  From the outside this appears to be more a shared failure caused by the complexity of multiple interacting systems within the company maintained by multiple teams, some of whom may rarely have direct interaction (if at all).CrowdStrike&#39;s final incident report may reveal more information at whatever point it becomes available."

About the only project I&#39;ve heard of that might be an exception to this is the flight control software that was used on U.S. space shuttles.  However, that team operated under an extremely process-heavy development process that no commercial software vendor I&#39;ve worked for has the patience for.  This includes my experience at one vendor whose core product was 30+ years old and had a very mature codebase.Based on CrowdStrike&#39;s preliminary incident report, it is clear that the software update passed their normal testing process.  However, one uploaded file contained invalid content.  It had passed the content validation suite, but in their incident review they discovered a gap in the test suite that the error slipped through.It&#39;s not entirely clear from the above preliminary report, but the way the error manifested may not always be repeatable.  If this were true, it might help to explain how the error got past other types of product tests.  It crashed the Windows kernel due to a memory read error, and these often can be hard to reproduce or detect.They messed up, but not as badly as you might think."
