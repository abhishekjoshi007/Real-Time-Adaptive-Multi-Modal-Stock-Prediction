NTNX trades now at 6.5x forward revenue, I&#39;m sure a strategic buyer is willing to pay a premium to Smartsheet&#39;s 6x due to operational/strategic synergies but their multiple does not bode well for a NTNX acquisition.  The conundrum of NTNX&#39;s Monday&#39;s marketcap increase of 15% is a killer for the multiple. Still very unclear to me what drove this as a shares increase should be offset by a stock price decrease (issuing shares does not increase the value of the company in itself)."

I was rereading the CRN article last Feb about Dell cancelling the VMW GTM agreement at once (2 years before official expiration) after the Broadcom acquisition. It states that the Dell channel accounting for 40% of VMW sales, that is $7 billion! Subsequently Dell and NTNX cozied up and started working together. Now, not all that $5b is going to flow to NTNX, of course, but even small portion would be a meaningful amount for NTNX, particularly when you combine that with a recent article referring research that half of VMW customers weigh alternatives. So you have now the demand side cratering as well as the &#39;supply&#39; (GTM channel) side to stop pushing VMW---that&#39;s a double whammy. Dell may even turn to NTNX as VxRail replacement, just like CSCO terminated HyperFlex. Maybe someone with more knowledge on product strategy level can chime in what is realistic?"

One would assume they have good institutional knowledge of the space and some (perhaps many) customers who they can sell competing products to. One can be sure that Dell does not want to sell anything from Broadcom. It could be a nice channel and one that can source big deals.I would not expect Dell to acquire Nutanix. They don&#39;t have enough cash on hand for something like that, and they had trouble with debt when they owned VMWare, which part of the reason they divested, so I wouldn&#39;t expect them to finance an acquisition. All-stock is possible of course. The response of the street to companies making acquisitions at a premium is often to punish the acquiring company&#39;s stock, which would have the immediate effect of lowering the acquisition price for NTNX shareholders."

The price started to recover right after that. It looks like they were selling from 7/11 to 7/24. So, it certainly does explain the decline in share price we saw during that time. These were not sales prior to 6/30. They have been selling over previous quarters, so my guess is these were planned sales to scale out. Maybe they are done selling and wanted to rebalance. I don&#39;t know. It could also be that they realize this is Bain&#39;s show now. Is it just a mere coincidence that Generation completes their sales by 7/24 and Bain gets their shares on 7/29? Interesting, don&#39;t you think? I also find it strange that the short interest as of the last report was 4,982,111. Generation sold 4,619,101 shares. Did someone cover?"
