Yahoo,2024-09-15,"Sometimes I&#39;m amazed what I overlook in reading articles. I was rereading the CRN article last Feb about Dell cancelling the VMW GTM agreement at once (2 years before official expiration) after the Broadcom acquisition. It states that the Dell channel accounting for 40% of VMW sales, that is $7 billion! Subsequently Dell and NTNX cozied up and started working together. Now, not all that $5b is going to flow to NTNX, of course, but even small portion would be a meaningful amount for NTNX, particularly when you combine that with a recent article referring research that half of VMW customers weigh alternatives. So you have now the demand side cratering as well as the &#39;supply&#39; (GTM channel) side to stop pushing VMW---that&#39;s a double whammy.
