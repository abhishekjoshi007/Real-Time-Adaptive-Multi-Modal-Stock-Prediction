ON, STM, and IFX don&#39;t sell wafers to the external market, they produce some wafers internally and buy the rest from suppliers so lower cost on wafers is a benefit to them but it&#39;s the end of WOLF. And as ON frequently says, it&#39;s not just about the device, it&#39;s about the die, packaging, and device."

So far this year, unit sales for true EVs are down 8.4%, and this decline has been ongoing for a while. The situation is even bleaker for hybrids, with sales down nearly 14% compared to last year."

This will go to $250 before anything you claim happens and I will be 3/4 out when that happens. You have no facts and probably not a lot of friends. Point us in any direction that supports your claims. I am more concerned that US puts a stop to US companies supplying China SIC than China catching up."
