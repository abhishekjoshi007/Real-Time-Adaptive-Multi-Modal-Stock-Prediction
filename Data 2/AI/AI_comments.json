Everything is timing and Covid times sent the economy reeling.  So for those that have believed TS that this company is a game changer in this field—have been buying shares on weakness (and there sure has been a lot of that).  But watching PLTR rise from its low of 6 dollars to 45 today in a matter of almost 2 years—I think C3 investors can give this smaller company some time to see if it can also rise almost 8 fold.  C3 was around 10 and now 26….with its limited shares available—shorts finally letting this one go and economy looking good for its product.  Add the two major lawsuits which it will win since it holds patents—and they are billion dollar lawsuits….i think investors will be rewarded WAY more then investing in a company that will give you 10 to 15% return in a year."

I think this might be different, of course I suspect they tank it at the open as they have consistently even on big up days, but I suspect it may very well break the 75 mark this time before they start to drive it down.3 1/2 years later.....

These emails were intended for a third party software company in India which Cummins had hired to copy the c3 software.

This will have wrapped up by the time C3 reports their quarter in the first week of Dec.  With the tax loss selling pressure off, the stock will be able to move higher.2) All indications are that sales of artificial intelligence software are taking off.  Results reported yesterday by NOW and IBM are the latest data points.  The shorts are exiting to get out of the way of good results that C3 will be reporting in about 6 weeks.  Although short interest is dropping, as of Oct 15, there was still 22% of the float sold short.  There is likely to be a big short covering rally when C3 reports their quarter in Dec."

The strategist recommends that investors continue to play the long term trends in the economy in 2025 and artificial intelligence is at the top of that list.  UBS and its US subsidiary company bought over 300,000 C3 shares during April-May-June, so obviously they feel that C3 is a good way to play the artificial intelligence theme.  In its most recently reported quarter C3 had growth of 21% and this growth rate will most likely increase when we hear from the company in about 6 weeks.  At some point sales will get to a level where the stock price will start to move higher."

I have been simply asking for 4 years (owned the stock for 3.3 years) -would/could your money be better invested somewhere other than with C3.ai. The Answer has always been yes- with the exception of traders, and those who waited until it bottomed out at $11. Some in this forum swore they were heavily invested in the 50&#39;s/60&#39;s and now have a basis under 20. I remain skeptical, because the Math doesn&#39;t work. C3 has been a bad investment; thankfully we have all benefited from a great market. (and it may get a little better) Hoping for gold at $3,000 and silver at $40. Not worried about NVDA and TSM."

A stock market theme that she&#39;s recommending right now is the adoption and implementation of artificial intelligence.  So this is positive for C3.  We&#39;re now moving out of artificial intelligence phase 1 in which all the investment dollars were going into hardware companies.  We&#39;ve started to move into phase 2 in which investment dollars go into software companies for adoption and implementation of artificial intelligence.  C3&#39;s stock price has gone above $25 as we start to move into phase 2.  As we move further into phase 2, the stock price can go above 30, then 40, then next year, 50.  If you buy C3 shares now, you can double your money by the end of next year.  Note that JPM has already started buying a lot of C3 shares.  During April-May-June, they more than doubled their position in the stock with a buy of around 175,000 shares."

Why would you think that a large group  of shares are &#34;sold short&#34; at the magical $14 figure? What evidence is there (at all) that some savvy traders would  borrow and sell shares at $14-  and then for a year- leave the trade on?  How could anyone in their right mind, base investment decisions, or the future of C3 stock on such a fantasy? The actual- folks that  are  &#34;stuck&#34; are the ones who bought thousands of shares of C3, 2-4 years ago; and can&#39;t find the courage or good sense- to move on.  The truth, is sometimes a- beach."

Soon, they will get their reparations.  Without borders and proper immigration the USA is doomed.  Look what has happened with all the Gaza people they let into the country.

But the great majority are in INDEX funds, not actively managed funds- which may just &#34;mimic&#34; the Market, or Tech Indexes in general. Why you insist on pushing these fantasies, is a mystery. But- you may convince some small/new investors to buy in. (Possibly a better way for them to participate are....... those Index Funds.)"

They had retail investors believing a few things.  First, that this was a FAKE company and will go bankrupt.  Second, that TS and multiple CFO were cooking the books.  Thirdly, that they have no one buying their products.  Those were the big ones.  To this day, two out of the three of those statements are still being bantered around.  Wedbush realizing that PR is so negative around C3 that even though they still believe in the company, they have revised lower.  This same analyst though, has revised up PLTR to 45 (which is hard to justify that price target and valuation) because of big names investing in it.  Although, I agree with you 100% that it is ridiculous that this not at 52 week high---my suggestion would be to wait till earnings.  TS knows what the street wants.  They want to see a profit.  The street currently does not care for over 20% growth or a promise that it will see big profits when they come two years from now.  That said, with PLTR something like 6 times higher P/S sales ratio then C3 and C3 getting more and more contracts, it seems that it is only a matter of time before C3 will start to explode upwards.  Also, note that if C3 was in such bad shape, WHY is short positions lowering weekly??  Also, short lending rates are a dismal 1%.  Far from the 30% and higher when the stock was up around 35."

First, it opens the door for a wider range of voices and perspectives. Chief’s strong opinions often dominated discussions, sometimes stifling contributions from less vocal members. Without this influence, others may feel more empowered to share their ideas, fostering a richer, more diverse dialogue.Additionally, the departure encourages the community to evolve. New topics and innovative discussions can emerge when familiar patterns are disrupted. This shift allows for fresh insights and creative solutions to surface, invigorating the conversation around AI.Moreover, without Chief&#39;s frequent posts, the board may become a space for more collaborative discussions. Members can now engage without the pressure of responding to a prominent figure, leading to more organic interactions and connections. This can help build a sense of community where everyone feels valued and heard.Not to mention he was an idiot!"

One fund manager cites &#34;artificial intelligence fatigue&#34; for this.  He said that investors are looking for more information about what the demand for artificial intelligence products is before buying any more shares of companies like this.  Growth at C3 was 21% in the most recent quarter and will probably be higher when the company reports a couple of months from now.  I think that as growth continues to accelerate investors will forget about &#34;artificial intelligence fatigue&#34; and start buying C3 shares."

He pointed out that since 1950, in election years, when the stock market is up at least 10% through Sept 30, the market&#39;s been up in Q4 every time.  He expects tech to be one of the leading market sectors in Q4.  TFC was holding 20,000 C3 shares as of June 30.  A strategist from Voy was also on.  She thinks lower interest rates will be bullish for stocks.  Her firm bought close to six million C3 shares late last year, they added over a quarter million more shares in Q1, and another three hundred thousand shares in Q2.  Obviously they like the stock."

(NYSE:AI). Originally named “C3 Energy,” C3.ai has changed its name multiple times based on whatever hot new trend they were supposedly capitalizing on. The “energy” theme was about smart grid and cap-and-trade. Then the firm changed its name to “C3 IoT” to attempt to capitalize on the Internet of Things buzz. After that trend fizzled out, the moniker was altered once more, with the company capturing the “AI” ticker in December 2020 – a savvy move if it wants to sell stock to credulous investors, but irrelevant to its business prospects. As Kerrisdale put it, the company is a “minor, cash burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company.”"

Originally named “C3 Energy,” C3.ai has changed its name multiple times based on whatever hot new trend they were supposedly capitalizing on. The “energy” theme was about smart grid and cap-and-trade. Then the firm changed its name to “C3 IoT” to attempt to capitalize on the Internet of Things buzz. After that trend fizzled out, the moniker was altered once more, with the company capturing the “AI” ticker in December 2020 – a savvy move if it wants to sell stock to credulous investors, but irrelevant to its business prospects. As Kerrisdale put it, the company is a “minor, cash burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company.”"

Either u believe that this company will continue to grow at above 20% or not.  If it’s a not - even if they sign deal, this will crash.  But if you do—then deal is really insignificant of future stock price since it will grow quickly.

She said that artificial intelligence is a theme that JPM will be investing in for the next decade plus.  She pointed out that so far most of the money that has been made in artificial intelligence stocks has been made in the hardware stocks, especially NVDA.  But she&#39;s now telling clients to start taking some profits in NVDA and move the money into artificial intelligence software stocks - software is now finally about to go.  JPM has already been playing this theme, during April-May-June they more than doubled their position in C3 with a buy of around 175,000 shares.  Based on what their strategist is saying, it sounds like JPM is also going to more than double their position in C3 stock in Q3 and then maybe again in Q4.  Everything is now in place for C3&#39;s stock to go.  Demand for artificial intelligence products is really taking off and C3 has the products that enterprise customers want.  All that is necessary is for everyone to stop putting all their money into NVDA and start putting some of it into software."

But now, with demand for artificial intelligence software really starting to take off, you wonder if someone might come in and make Tom an offer that is just too good to refuse.

Well, TS has to believe that he will not get the valuation that he thinks C3 deserves UNTIL that happens.  PLTR is moving up and fast.   Hitting all time highs and C3 should be right there with them.  Hopefully TS gets this through his head and makes the appropriate changes to make it so."

Considering that all analysts said that the selling after earnings was NOT warranted and overdone, the winners were the ones who bought when this sank into the 18 area.

With the indices recognizing PLTR future growth—I’m betting on the latter."

The current data From Fintel: institutional Shares (Long)58,248,793 - 47.15% (ex 13D/G) - change of 5.15MM.  The Nasdaq shows 45%.  This is very good news as its creeping up and up.  Shopify as an example had its shares around 25%  in the beginning with MASSIVE short attack.  Almost mirrored the attack on C3 (except C3&#39;s attack lasted much longer).  But as Shopify showed that the attack was unwarranted, the institutional investment climbed and climbed to about 67%.  Hence the stock split.  Keep letting us know Byron about institutions buying."

With 120 artificial intelligence software products now for sale, C3 can be considered the artificial intelligence software leader just as much as NVDA is the artificial intelligence hardware leader.  NVDA&#39;s market cap is now around 1,000 times the C3 market cap.  As C3&#39;s leadership in artificial intelligence software becomes clearer, that gap will narrow.

As of June 30, BAC owned over 10m PLTR shares, an indication that there is plenty of room for institutional investors to continue to add to their positions in C3.  As of June 30, BAC owned over 300,000 C3 shares, which was an increase of around 50,000 shares during the quarter.  BAC obviously likes the outlook for artificial intelligence software stocks.  They will most likely continue to add to their C3 position, and will probably eventually own millions of C3 shares, just like other institutional investors already own."

With C3 P/S 4 times lower than PLTR, a shift in perception about C3 and amount of shares available can send this stock moving forward.  I have not come across an article or analyst that stated the sell off after earnings was justified.  All of them stated it was an over reaction.  Kudos for those that had funds and courage to buy when it hit 18.   My average is 21 price point but was all tapped out at that time to buy more (but to be honest—I had trepidation about buying more shares).  We will see where we are at soon enough."

Current revenues would not be impacted by the end of the JV.  Potentially a short term loss of new oil and gas clients yet given the new markets and higher government revenues, very minimal.  Though of course the company wants as many partners out there as they can get and yes, BH was their first real partner when they went by the name c3.Energy, because almost all of their revenues were oil, gas and utilities.  Between Shell Oil, Engie and to a degree Enel who they are in a large law suit over the theft of IP, they accounted for most of their early revenues.

All the analysts that were already negative on this stock before earnings added downgrades to share price (20 to 22 area) have C3 on a HOLD NOT a SELL. You still have other analysts that lowered their price target but still almost 50% higher at 30. The average, I believe, is around 26. I have been very disappointed in the stock price for the last two years, yet I am still around because growth still seems to be there and seems that it is only a matter of time before sentiment changes for this company. PLTR is at around 34 with an incredibly high P/S ratio. C3 is almost 4 times LOWER in P/S ratio. Therefore, unless C3 is a fraudulent company, it is hard not to stick by it for at least a little longer to see if sentiment changes and profitability is as inevitable as TS claims it is."

I did have the fear of course of other posters claiming that this will fall to 12 dollars and then took credit for calling a 7% drop.  I was concerned and upset that my hefty investment has stayed flat...YET, I have started out very modestly in this Company and have added and added on all the downturns to now become a hefty investment.   Now, that my frustration is over since going over the report and hearing CEO TS talk about the company.  I do feel reassured that this will grow.  With interest rates now set to fall to spur more growth, with C3 going into new fields and continuing to grow at over 20% rate.  Will continue to add shares once again.  Good Luck to all the LONGS"

It&#39;s still software but the new accounting rule requires that it be counted as services.  This made C3&#39;s Q1 software revenue look very weak.  It&#39;s starting to look to me like a lot of investors didn&#39;t understand this, and this accounted for most of the selloff at the open yesterday.  The stock price is now starting to come back as investors figure out what really happened.  C3 revenues were up 21% in Q1 - there was no weakness anywhere.  This stock should be trading at around $30, not around $20."

With even the BEARISH analysts having price points where the stock is now currently trading....Dare I say, the worst is behind it?  We will see if shorts will continue to attack but with this low price and earnings looking good and CEO, who so far, has been straight forward with numbers and future guidance (love it or hate it) for past 8 quarters stating that he sees this growth continuing NOT for a quarter or two, but for years.  Until he is proven otherwise will continue to hold and hopefully the market sentiment towards this company will change."

I would guess not, as I suppose you are just repeating what you read from the analysts.&#34;My reply (partial): &#34;I looked into the financial statments. R&amp;D costs increased from last quarter and last year. 52.9 million in this quarter vs 50.62 last quarter. Last year (July 2023) Q1 R&amp;D was 50.8 million. So C3 is increasing R&amp;D cost not decreasing them as you stated.Also sales and admin costs are 71.8 million in this quarter vs 63.8 million in (July 2023 Q1) so that is increasing y/y also.&#34; Didn&#39;t hear anything from the Shaggy. To be fair the messaging system is glitching lately."

Volumes are somewhat sketchy with this one anyway, I still believe most are holding and that a lot of the volume is contrived by shorts attempting to create some narrative of capitulation.  Even on the day the stock hit its all time low, the trading volume was around 1.6 million shares, not a stock experiencing capitulation at 10.18, not experiencing it now.  Did you see anything in the report that indicates the company isn&#39;t following its intended trajectory?  To say the company missed its mark on subscriptions to me is misleading and meaningless.  I personal do not recall a single company or analyst prediction on subs prior to earnings, unless they expected all revenues to be subs, which has never happened.  And secondly, the company is in the transition away from subscriptions.  Furthermore, the margins for engineered solutions or whatever they bucketed 13 million dollars of revenues in was netting an 85% margin, much better than what they were for subscriptions."

They&#39;re pretty effective with a small-cap like this, but they are very exposed to BIG investors if they decide to make a meal out of the shorts - tons of $$$ on the sidelines looking for AI opps. Amazing to me that a small company like this has successfully navigated the .gov and military spaces (slow &amp; arduous sales process). This is how Oracle (CAP $388B) started out - commercial success will be faster and easier going forward. Shortfall in subscription rev is a non-issue and has happened to every SW company in the world making that transition. I may get the stock put to me, but liking it more and more - especially with 1/3 of stock value in cash with positive FCF this quarter. Back up the truck!In Q1, the Company closed 71 agreements (an increase of 122%) including 52 pilots (increase of 117%).The Company significantly expanded its footprint across State and Local Government, closing 25 agreements with municipal, county, and state agenciesThe Company entered into new agreements with GSK, Eletrobras, Valero, Swift, SmithRx, Sanofi, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Defense, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Ingersoll Rand, among others.Company entered into new and expansion agreements with the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the U.S. Intelligence CommunityTheir SG&amp;A is high because they are investing in SALES (and executing) - exactly what you want at this stage!"

Their year over year growth was 21% which he said was in the top 10 of publicly traded software companies.  When asked about profitability he said that profitablility is a mathematical certainty.  All they have to do is continue to grow and continue to scale the business and they are certain to reach profitability.

Enterprise customers are getting big increases in productivity and efficiency using artificial intelligence, and more use cases are appearing all the time.  I&#39;m expecting a very strong report from C3 next Wednesday.  If enterprise customers want a predictive maintenance product like the one that is giving SHEL $2b in economic benefit every year, they have to buy from C3.  No one else has a comparable product."

C3 has been designated as oversold so will be interesting to see if it does climb into its earnings report or float around here.  A few posters here stated this would sink to 17 and some stated below 10.  That is just as bad as those posters who predict 70s and up after this earnings report.  But I believe Kudos to those that have the courage to invest at these low 20s with all the downward pressure.  I think it’s a no brainer but we will see.  Good luck trading!"

He makes up excuses all the time on conference calls which makes him look incompetent in my opinion. For the record I personally don&#39;t believe that the company is a fraud, as it passed audits before."

It seems that the BIG fear that analysts are projecting to retail investors is the Expense side of business.  TS stated as far back as 8 quarters ago that he will SPEND to grow the company as much as possible in the beginning.  Analysts stated that they wanted to see that expense go down and for TS to start showing profits.  So here we are now....Seems like his vision of the company growing is happening and set to grow even more with the big tech companies now behind it.  The question will be WILL expense spending start to decrease?  Will TS start focusing on share price?  I am unsure on price action on this stock till earnings.  Can this go lower?  Sure it can.   Anemic volume on this stock.  But many of the metrics show this stock to be an easy double/triple stock price from where it is at.  P/S is at 9 while PLTR is at 30.  NO DEBT and plenty of cash on the side.  No need for an offering or to raise cash.....Even to say that someone has some insider info that earnings are bad--the volume is too low to indicate any of that.  Earnings report can not come fast enough to stop this bleeding....."

The only thing that will bring it back up is if the SEC goes after the other short selling firms like they currently are with Citron Research. I suspect that the current short sellers control the price with matched bids between their short selling hedge funds as well as layering/spoofing. Only the SEC can get the data to prove it but the price action of this stock defies analysis."

The attack on it has been very successful as well as analysts “hold” rating no matter what price it reached in the last two years—I mean, how do you not tell your followers to buy when it sank to 10 dollars??  Anyway, everyone, even Dan Ives (who has a price target of 35) is in a wait and see pattern for the earnings report.  I do believe he is even frustrated that C3 is not showing a profit.  This earnings report will be HUGE.  I am all loaded up with new buys in this range as I find it difficult to believe that ALL companies in this field are exploding upwards with great revenue and C3 will not follow suit."

They were holding around 20,000 C3 shares on Sept 30, 2023.  Then in Q4 they bought 5.76m shares.  They&#39;ve continued to add since then.  In Q1-24 they added 264,000 shares, and in Q2 they added 300,000 shares.  When someone has a large position, then keeps adding hundreds of thousands of shares each quarter, that&#39;s bullish."

Technical support for products, despite the large customer expenses seems lacking. The companies growth rate compared to other public and non public competitors isn’t living up to expectations. Competitors look to be designing better products that are easier to use. The hype of the CEO sacrificing profits for revenue growth has been minimal over the last 4 years for such a small company in a technological moat. The jury is still out on whether C3 will be able to compete or lead the way forward. They seem like more of an “Us too” company not a leader."

I have actually made quite a bit of money from using the interest received for lending out shares to play this volitivity.  I have more then doubled that amount.  TOO many positives occuring in this field for C3 to stay below 30.  I expect this to be in the mid 30s after earnings report.  A gain of roughly 40% from today&#39;s price.  I feel very confident in C3&#39;s rise as I have put NEW money to work in low 20s with sale of other stocks (FSLR which I posted).  So we will see.  If I am wrong will say so, BUT I expect you do to the same.  So let us see where C3 will be on Sept 5."

Take for example, Billionaire Griffin who bought over a hundred million dollars of PLTR stock after selling Navidia stock recently.  Even though he is buying over the top of the average price analysts&#39; target.  As word gets out, after the fact, retail investors then buy more, thus raising price even more (perception becomes reality).  Second, C3 has yet to report, TS has been very vocal how great sales are and this small/midcap company is growing.  It will not take much to eventually launch this company MUCH higher.  Would like to see the percentage of funds increase every year to the level of SHOPIFY (which is in the 60s).  We will see where that level is after this next earnings report and hopefully C3 can move higher then the 40% mark (which is okay but not GREAT)."

I use those proceedings which was a large amount to add to my position of C3 today at 25 (which already was HUGE).  This actually was at a higher price then my break even point of around 19.  BUT I plan on holding this for roughly 5 years depending of course on stock price and if it is doing great then we will see.  I believe in the company and TS.  I do expect this company&#39;s stock to be in the hundreds in 5 years time.  Good luck to all those longs and do not lose faith unless earning&#39;s report show a negative report.  Also, the analyst Ives has been good to me and unless he reverses course, I will keep adding if stock price gives me an opportunity."

The strategist from TFC was on TV today and said that with the decline in the price of a lot of these stocks, the risk/reward situation has improved and he&#39;s upgraded the sector to overweight.  He noted that the long term secular growth trend for artificial intelligence remains intact.  At the end of Q1, TFC owned 20,000 C3 shares, their Q2 13F will be coming in in the next few days, so we&#39;ll see what that looks like.  Based on comments made by the strategist today, it sounds like TFC is buying more C3 shares now in Q3."

Not as many shares are available to own for institutions and many won&#39;t pay much above asking to try and convert retail investors into sellers.  So it almost takes an institutional investor to sell shares onto the open market for another to buy at a reasonable price and the necessary quantities that a fund would demand."

I do like C3’s position and can see how some funds have sold shares and some have bought as this company still has many questions to answer—but if they can start showing that path to profitability and hitting it—this will be off to the races."

When he started Siebel Systems, he was profitable from day one, though he allowed very slow and organic growth to allow the company to grow, then when the first real competitor came along with a slightly better mouse trap using a &#34;novel&#34; payment scheme SAS, they quickly started to take market share that wasn&#39;t already dedicated to Siebel, because there was no switching costs involved.  I get that he is trying to avoid that pitfall this time around, though like you, believe that he needs to focus on the fiscal management of the company now even more so than long term positioning.  If they haven&#39;t built up a strong front of the store position yet, they may never do so, so now is the time to really think about the long term success of the company and that means being profitable."
