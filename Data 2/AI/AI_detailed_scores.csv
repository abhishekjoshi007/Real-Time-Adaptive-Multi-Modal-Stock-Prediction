Many investors speculate this type of behavior tends to follow certain patterns, including a tendency for bashers to only bash stocks which are generally trending upwards and showing potential.Having said that, financial regulators constantly monitor the markets for what they call bad actors or stock bashers. According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), investors may find it difficult to get information about these securities and any tidbits they may find can lead them to act—even if it&#39;s misinformation.

The total dollar volume of shorted shares was approximately $697.37 million, although this figure fluctuated throughout the year​&#34;",Negative,-1,0.9914774298667908,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-05,Well PLTR just blew up all the cons on C3 and AI busting out of the water.  C3 should be up huge tomorrow and am surprised that investors are not picking up shares after hours.  Kudos to those that bought at the lows today because that will probably be the lowest you will see on this stock.  Has a whole month now to climb up above 30 before earnings and that should be as explosive as PLTR&#39;s which will push this to new 52 week highs.
