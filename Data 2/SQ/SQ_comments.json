I dont know about your world, but Im sure you know someone who bought into TSLA 8 years ago and made 30,000 profit. I know folks who bought into AAPL, AMD, NVDA 30 years ago, etc... Sure, sometimes you get lucky. But most of the time, youre chasing something after the fact. At your age, youre half my age, you can go super heavy into tech e.g., VGR, CIBR, SPY, and thats a solid move. But I wouldnt allocate more than 520 of your portfolio into individual stocks. One thing I might do if I were you is set up an automatic, weekly deposit of 100 into VTI and leave your portfolio alone for a few months. Shoot, why not a year???. Slowly, youll see those losses become a smaller and smaller percentage of your total portfolio. At which point, you wont notice those losses. And who knows, maybe they climb back in that time?

If theres other things you believe would fare better, then switch. But since you mention taxes that changes it all. You either need to figure that out or get a tax advisor. I have one of those names and even though I would certainly sell it here, it would give me a tax loss that Id rather not crystallize right now. So Im weighing tax consideration versus investing consideration which you also have to do."

I am holding mine through the end of the rate cuts to see if they can restart growth. PYPL a bit of a risk, but this is one you have to hold. Company seems to be doing okay not stellar, but fine. Very undervalued if it is doing fine. It is crushed on fears that other competitors are going to starve it out, but again, seems to be doing fine. SQ? Owned it at one time, but not now. It is growing revenue at 20 a quarter though. Why would you not keep it? I havent look in depth, so there may be something not obvious. Remember that Tesla was flat for 5 years before it went up 10x. If you were looking at the numbers behind Tesla, you were buying shares the whole time and not worrying about it. Best thing to do is and I am going to make an assumption learn how to value the companies that you hold, so you know if they are currently stting the bed or undervalued. If you bought these stocks, you should know why you bought them and if your investment thesis has changed. The price of a stock often deviates from the fundamentals of the company, and this is how you find money making opportunities. Personally, I am holding PYPL waiting for it to be valued higher. I would probably hold SQ if I owned any. I am holding ETSY to see if they can turn it around. The business story is good, the execution is not as good, and the growth is pitiful, so if revenue growth resumes, the price shoots up. AFRM no idea. EDIT I want to say that I dont own huge amounts of these. These are risky. If you own a lot of this for the size of your portfolio, you should probably look for exits but this appears to be an up market, so take your time."

The mega cap can swing by 10 sometimes, the small caps even in 50 different stocks can swing by 30 anytime. So when it was down by 30, I panicked and sold. I realized that I have invested too much money on something that I am not comfortable to lose. So I slowlymonthly invest a fixed amount that I am comfortable to lose, so I would be sway by the economic downturns and will hold until a solid gain.

During the height of COVID in 20202021, new car sales were heavily impacted supply chain especially semiconductor shortages greatly reduced the availability of new cars, while financiallyimpacted consumers were not in a strong buying position. The auto parts market experienced some of their best years, as more people turned to increasing repairs of their existing vehicles. As the economy and supply chains have now more thoroughly stabilizedrecovered, the availability of new cars has increased and consumers are reaching a point where they either have to replace, or are otherwise in a better financial position to opt for buying new vehicles. With more new vehicles covered by manufacturer warranties, theres less aftermarket repair parts sales. The market may be rough for these companies for the next couple of years... Considering a likely sizable portion of current and recent buyers are doing so because they have to, German carmakers mainly positioned as luxury brands in the major U.S. market may not be catching as much of the resurgence of new car demand. VW is presumably still experiencing reputation issues."

Before the pandemic, everything was straightforwardparts availability was nearly perfect, and 99 of outofstock items could be sourced overnight. During COVID, we began to see delays, with essential parts sometimes taking days, weeks, or even months to arrive. Basic tools like bits and wrenches became scarce, often taking months to be delivered. To cope, we started shipping incomplete toolsets and sent the missing pieces as they became available. Despite these challenges, business was strong during this time, as people had disposable income and invested in vehicle maintenance, even when it wasnt urgent. PostCOVID, we saw a sharp decline in nonessential maintenance. When faced with costly repairs, many customers opted to buy new cars, a trend accelerated by cheap vehicle leases. These leased vehicles wont hit aftermarket shops until their leases or warranties expire, typically 34 years later, reducing current workload. Inflation and higher wages further raised workshop labor rates, while increased material costs led to even fewer repairs, with customers only addressing urgent issues for vehicle inspections or to keep their cars running. Ive even read that the average tire tread depth is lower now compared to during COVID, which could be a dangerous trend. TLDR Before COVID, parts were easily accessible. During the pandemic, we saw delays, but business was good. After COVID, rising costs and cheaper leasing options led to a sharp decline in vehicle repairs, with customers focusing on only essential maintenance."

A lot of it is heavy parts and very specific SKUs that dont move much. Sure oil filters, wiper blades, etc can be online. But those have been available in Walmart for decades without impacting the business. Its not really viable for Amazon to keep that inventory taking space in a DC.

Company tried to buy it for their museum, but the doctor said hed started his career with it and hed finish it that way. They were pulling vellum prints trying to figure out how to fix it.

Weve been on electronic records long enough that the physical storage of adult records has generally timed out. Pediatric records have to be retained for 7 years past age of majority. This means you have another decade before those will be heading for destruction. Like I said, just a nurse, this may mean nothing. They charge us bank for offsite records storage.

Its like paying their electric bill. Just something they do without second thought. Id imagine those revenues are probably not going anywhere. At least not all at once or fast. Similar to what others have mentioned. The debttoequity ratio is insane. Are you looking for something like rate cuts to be the catalyst for this?

Yes but with their dividend at 2.64 it they raise the dividend to bring that up a point to over 3.5 which I think is the expectation baked into that price.

You can have subtotals in there too like operating income but thats usually the same as net income before tax, it just doesnt include things like interest expense. If an entity has pass through tax then there just isnt any tax on the financials. Taxable income is not on the financials usually. Its on the tax return. Its usually close to net income but can be different. On the tax return you usually start with net income and then add or deduct various adjustments to convert the financial statement IFRS US GAAP net income to USA taxable income. For example maybe some marketing expenses are included in the financials but not tax deductible so that would be added back. Your overall thesis could be right. I just wanted to correct that one part in case it has flow through consequences for your analysis."

So keeping net income low means that they can retain more capital to use to expand their assets without relying as much on debt. The metric generally used to track REIT performance and ability to pay dividends is Funds from operationsFFO. This is essentially cash flow after paying for all overhead expensesupkeep, interest, etc. Iron Mountains FFO is 4.12 per year.

The company is profitable and growing at a nice clip with great future prospects for accelerating growth. It&#39;s still very much undervalued, and the analyst consensus 12-month price target is 90, so there&#39;s a lot of room for growth with the share price as well. When SQ has a breakout ER within the next couple of quarters, those targets will likely head well into the triple digits followed by the share price. This seems like just a matter of patience from my perspective, but for day traders and other short-termers, there&#39;s probably a greater sense of urgency. Of course, there are also shorts who infect forums like this and try to bring the share price down, so please take what you read on here with many grains of salt (like a good margarita). Enjoy your weekend!"

For me, one of the key stats is the forward P/E of 15.2 expected for next year. That&#39;s very low for a tech company that&#39;s growing at a good rate and generating solid profits. I expect that as interest rates decline, SQ&#39;s forward P/E will go up to at least 20 and possibly to 30 or more (it&#39;s been much higher throughout most of Block&#39;s history). If it goes to 25, we&#39;re looking at a $110 stock. Even if it only goes to 20, SQ would be around $90 a share. And if SQ beats its earnings projections, those numbers will be even higher. This seems like one of the best opportunities in the market right now. It&#39;s now my largest position, with #2 being Nio, another stock I think will soar, and Snowflake, which is going through an uncertain time in its evolution, but I think will thrive long-term."

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects SQ) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of SQ to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

The same stock that was in the mid-50s during the pre-market on that crazy day in August when the whole market crashed before recovering quickly? SQ marched up nicely into the high 60s, so it&#39;s not surprising that there&#39;s been some profit-taking and consolidation before the next leg higher. And yes, I know SQ was much higher at its peak, but that doesn&#39;t take away from the facts the company&#39;s had a great last 12 months both with the fundamentals of the company and the stock price. I&#39;ll take a 50% ROI anytime with a one-year time horizon."

I sold some of my position a little while ago because the mid-69s is where it seems to find resistance, but I kept 2/3 of my position so that I benefit if the stock blows past that previous resistance. Glad SQ is now closer to fair value, though I see the real fair value being around 80-85. Next year, that fair value number will likely grow to triple digits."

It also would make sense given that the Fed didn&#39;t have a meeting last month and doesn&#39;t have one next month, and they held off on a rate cut in July despite being conflicted about it. They&#39;re smart enough to recognize that a half point cut wouldn&#39;t cause any harm and might well help facilitate (in conjunction with more cuts later this year and into next year) that soft landing they&#39;re striving for. Inflation is no longer a significant risk, whereas jobs and a potential recession are now the bigger risk factors, so 1/2 point makes sense.The only reasons to go a quarter point is because that&#39;s what they&#39;ve kind of indicated they would do, and because they generally like to move slowly with rate cuts unless they perceive an emergency.I&#39;d vote for 50 basis points if I were on the Fed, and I think a majority of voting Fed members might well do the same, though it&#39;s kind of a coin flip which way it will go. If I had to predict, I&#39;d say the Fed will cut by 50 points, which would be great for Block and many other stocks."

I then sell back all shares except my base shares when SQ moves higher (with a 1-3 point gain on every group of shares I buy and re-sell). This strategy works well with a stock staying in a range for a long period of time, as seems to be happening with SQ. It also protects me when SQ eventually explodes higher because I&#39;ll still have my base position. It doesn&#39;t protect me if SQ should lose 20% of its value or more, but I don&#39;t foresee that happening. I&#39;m typically an investor more than a trader, but SQ has provided a nice opportunity for doing both simultaneously."

I remain optimistic, and doubled my position early in the day before selling a third of my position late in the day to avoid a margin call. I hope to buy back those shares tomorrow if SQ gives back part of today&#39;s gain. I think this stock will soar after the Fed starts its interest rate cutting cycle and again after the election if not sooner. I think we&#39;ll see 80s or 90s by year-end and 120-150 by the end of &#39;25. Profitability is about to increase dramatically, and SQ has a nice array of vertically integrated businesses, all of which are poised to grow significantly."

I had intended to sell other positions to get out of my margin call today, but given the huge jump in SQ&#39;s share price today, I decided that was the best option. I still think this has upside, but the pattern lately has been very up-and-down, so I&#39;ll put in a buy order around $65."

I&#39;m in that situation now, as I&#39;ve sold 3/4 of my SQ shares this week, much of it late today, as I like to minimize my borrowing over the weekend, so I got my margin loan down a lot. I&#39;m hoping to buy a lot of these shares back at a lower price on Monday or Tuesday, as I&#39;m still a believer in SQ and see more upside for the stock long-term. There are just a lot of uncertainties right now with the Middle East, the election, the Japan situation, Russia-Ukraine, labor data, a potential recession or at least or moderate downturn (economic softening), and the usual September blues, so I decided to take some money off the table and bank a profit. If this continues heading upward at a nice clip, I still have 2000 shares, but at least I&#39;ll be able to sleep at night even if there&#39;s a downturn in the share price. I was way overextended before selling shares, and margin calls are no fun even when the market&#39;s going up.Further, I could see a scenario in which SQ heads back to the low 60s or even the 50s during this more uncertain time before jumping into the 70s or 80s in the weeks and months following the election (especially if it&#39;s a smooth transition of power this time) and/or after interest rates start going down."

Those 3 days after SQ reported were brutal, so a lot of the positive attention was lost for the time being. The stock was at 64+ after hours on the day it reported earnings, so it&#39;s back where it was then, but given how well the business is doing, I think it should be about 20 points higher. With that said, I sold half of my position over the last couple of days because it had become so large and I didn&#39;t want to have a big margin loan coming into September when things often get dicey. However, I&#39;ll start buying again around 62.5, and I&#39;ll sell even more starting in the mid-70s. Definitely want to hold my core position for a long time, as I think we&#39;ll see triple digits again next year, and maybe even 200 by 2026."

Tons of analyst upgrades and/or buy ratings along with another excellent ER and strong guidance.

Let&#39;s hope for a big rebound day tomorrow."

Analysts reaffirm their buy ratings for Square and reiterate or raise 12-month price targets that will likely range from 75-100 except for possibly a few outliers. That&#39;s already started to happen today. Then, members of the Fed start to speak out about their desire to cut rates in September (members of the Fed often have speaking engagements between Fed meetings). Then the share buybacks will begin in earnest. Then institutional investors will load up on SQ. No guarantees on all those things or their sequence, but I think they&#39;re all more likely than not."
