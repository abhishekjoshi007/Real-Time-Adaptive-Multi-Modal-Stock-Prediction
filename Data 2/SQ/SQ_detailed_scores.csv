Reddit,2024-08-18,"Whatever you do OP, just pay attention to what VTI has done in the same time. I dont know about your world, but Im sure you know someone who bought into TSLA 8 years ago and made 30,000 profit. I know folks who bought into AAPL, AMD, NVDA 30 years ago, etc... Sure, sometimes you get lucky. But most of the time, youre chasing something after the fact. At your age, youre half my age, you can go super heavy into tech e.g., VGR, CIBR, SPY, and thats a solid move. But I wouldnt allocate more than 520 of your portfolio into individual stocks. One thing I might do if I were you is set up an automatic, weekly deposit of 100 into VTI and leave your portfolio alone for a few months. Shoot, why not a year???. Slowly, youll see those losses become a smaller and smaller percentage of your total portfolio. At which point, you wont notice those losses. And who knows, maybe they climb back in that time? But like someone else mentioned, youre doing great!!",Neutral,0,0.9890466332435608,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-18,Sorry my guy. Ive been there. Assuming that your broker does NOT charge you to trade then its time to get out and put your money in a better investment now. Never consider the you have gained or lost as part of your buyholdsell decision. Only buy a stock when its a good short term bet price is down and a good long term bet DD on the fundamentals. Consider this is an election year and the market might shift in November. You may decide to sit in cash making 5 interest until the fed lowers rates. Take some time to review your current holdings to ensure they are NOT a great buy right now then sell. WHEN is a good time to realize your losses? Well... only when you can 1. Use your losses to offset great gains. 2 Use your losses to put yourself into a considerably lower tax bracket and pay a lower tax rate on all other income.,Neutral,0,0.9425751566886902,Reply

If theres other things you believe would fare better, then switch. But since you mention taxes that changes it all. You either need to figure that out or get a tax advisor.

Reddit,2024-08-18,"If those are all you have, sorry. I dont know about AFRM. ETSY is a company that is either going to turn it around once rich people feel a little richer, or it isnt. I am holding mine through the end of the rate cuts to see if they can restart growth. PYPL a bit of a risk, but this is one you have to hold. Company seems to be doing okay not stellar, but fine. Very undervalued if it is doing fine. It is crushed on fears that other competitors are going to starve it out, but again, seems to be doing fine. SQ? Owned it at one time, but not now. It is growing revenue at 20 a quarter though. Why would you not keep it? I havent look in depth, so there may be something not obvious. Remember that Tesla was flat for 5 years before it went up 10x. If you were looking at the numbers behind Tesla, you were buying shares the whole time and not worrying about it. Best thing to do is and I am going to make an assumption learn how to value the companies that you hold, so you know if they are currently stting the bed or undervalued. If you bought these stocks, you should know why you bought them and if your investment thesis has changed. The price of a stock often deviates from the fundamentals of the company, and this is how you find money making opportunities. Personally, I am holding PYPL waiting for it to be valued higher. I would probably hold SQ if I owned any. I am holding ETSY to see if they can turn it around. The business story is good, the execution is not as good, and the growth is pitiful, so if revenue growth resumes, the price shoots up. AFRM no idea. EDIT I want to say that I dont own huge amounts of these. These are risky.

During the height of COVID in 20202021, new car sales were heavily impacted supply chain especially semiconductor shortages greatly reduced the availability of new cars, while financiallyimpacted consumers were not in a strong buying position. The auto parts market experienced some of their best years, as more people turned to increasing repairs of their existing vehicles. As the economy and supply chains have now more thoroughly stabilizedrecovered, the availability of new cars has increased and consumers are reaching a point where they either have to replace, or are otherwise in a better financial position to opt for buying new vehicles. With more new vehicles covered by manufacturer warranties, theres less aftermarket repair parts sales. The market may be rough for these companies for the next couple of years... Considering a likely sizable portion of current and recent buyers are doing so because they have to, German carmakers mainly positioned as luxury brands in the major U.S. market may not be catching as much of the resurgence of new car demand.

Reddit,2024-10-12,"Ive worked in this industry for five years and witnessed the period before, during, and after COVID. Before the pandemic, everything was straightforwardparts availability was nearly perfect, and 99 of outofstock items could be sourced overnight. During COVID, we began to see delays, with essential parts sometimes taking days, weeks, or even months to arrive. Basic tools like bits and wrenches became scarce, often taking months to be delivered. To cope, we started shipping incomplete toolsets and sent the missing pieces as they became available. Despite these challenges, business was strong during this time, as people had disposable income and invested in vehicle maintenance, even when it wasnt urgent. PostCOVID, we saw a sharp decline in nonessential maintenance. When faced with costly repairs, many customers opted to buy new cars, a trend accelerated by cheap vehicle leases. These leased vehicles wont hit aftermarket shops until their leases or warranties expire, typically 34 years later, reducing current workload. Inflation and higher wages further raised workshop labor rates, while increased material costs led to even fewer repairs, with customers only addressing urgent issues for vehicle inspections or to keep their cars running. Ive even read that the average tire tread depth is lower now compared to during COVID, which could be a dangerous trend. TLDR Before COVID, parts were easily accessible. During the pandemic, we saw delays, but business was good. After COVID, rising costs and cheaper leasing options led to a sharp decline in vehicle repairs, with customers focusing on only essential maintenance.",Positive,1,0.8773351311683655,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-19,Great DD and good luck! I was looking at them a few months ago. Project Matterhorn seems to be wrapping up now. Looks like it was a success. My initial assumption was that physical document storage would have evaporated long before now. But I guess industries like law firms and defense contractors legally need to keep documents for x years. The interesting thing is their customers probably view paying them as overhead. Its like paying their electric bill. Just something they do without second thought. Id imagine those revenues are probably not going anywhere. At least not all at once or fast. Similar to what others have mentioned. The debttoequity ratio is insane. Are you looking for something like rate cuts to be the catalyst for this? Or just waiting for the market to notice this as well? Good luck friend!,Neutral,0,0.9226345419883728,Reply

Do customers ever save fewer documents? No. Do they ever say screw it. Lets stop storing these documents? No. Do they store more documents over time? Yes. The business is basically undisruptable. If you are looking for them to have a big drop in revenue, I wouldnt bet on it. Are they overpriced now? Yes but with their dividend at 2.64 it they raise the dividend to bring that up a point to over 3.5 which I think is the expectation baked into that price.

Yahoo,2024-09-26,"This is exactly the type of stock I love to invest in: An undervalued growth stock with a unique combination of businesses that generate profits and have huge opportunities to accelerate their growth and profits in the near future and beyond. For me, one of the key stats is the forward P/E of 15.2 expected for next year. That&#39;s very low for a tech company that&#39;s growing at a good rate and generating solid profits. I expect that as interest rates decline, SQ&#39;s forward P/E will go up to at least 20 and possibly to 30 or more (it&#39;s been much higher throughout most of Block&#39;s history). If it goes to 25, we&#39;re looking at a $110 stock. Even if it only goes to 20, SQ would be around $90 a share. And if SQ beats its earnings projections, those numbers will be even higher. This seems like one of the best opportunities in the market right now. It&#39;s now my largest position, with #2 being Nio, another stock I think will soar, and Snowflake, which is going through an uncertain time in its evolution, but I think will thrive long-term.",Positive,1,0.9999974966049194,Main

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects SQ) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of SQ to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;.

Yahoo,2024-08-16,"Does anyone on here ever root for a stock they own to go down? I&#39;m in that situation now, as I&#39;ve sold 3/4 of my SQ shares this week, much of it late today, as I like to minimize my borrowing over the weekend, so I got my margin loan down a lot. I&#39;m hoping to buy a lot of these shares back at a lower price on Monday or Tuesday, as I&#39;m still a believer in SQ and see more upside for the stock long-term. There are just a lot of uncertainties right now with the Middle East, the election, the Japan situation, Russia-Ukraine, labor data, a potential recession or at least or moderate downturn (economic softening), and the usual September blues, so I decided to take some money off the table and bank a profit. If this continues heading upward at a nice clip, I still have 2000 shares, but at least I&#39;ll be able to sleep at night even if there&#39;s a downturn in the share price. I was way overextended before selling shares, and margin calls are no fun even when the market&#39;s going up.Further, I could see a scenario in which SQ heads back to the low 60s or even the 50s during this more uncertain time before jumping into the 70s or 80s in the weeks and months following the election (especially if it&#39;s a smooth transition of power this time) and/or after interest rates start going down.",Negative,-1,0.7678537368774414,Main
