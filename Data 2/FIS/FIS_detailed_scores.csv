Reddit,2024-10-29,"Thats a fair way to look at it. From my perspective, its conservative mgmt that has always beat and raised and outpaced analyst expectations theyve also called out in regards to 26 guidance that it didnt incorporate any new products which theyve had new launches since this guidance was released and will inevitably have more. I also personally disagree that a high growth fintech should be valued as a legacy bank most of which have sub 10 rev growth. If their tech platform really accelerates and gets deals with large financial institutions itll be hard to ignore its part of the valuation delta vs banks. Theyve also leaned into originating for other companies no capital loan origination and loan servicing revenue where they dont take on risk. Its possible that growth completely stagnates in 27 but I dont think itll be that mature of company by then. Right now massive tailwinds for company with interest rate cuts, regulatory changes driving demand for tech platform, significant demand for loans for higher income individuals which is Sofia bread and butter.
