In case the private sector stops buying new debt under such unfair conditions, the FED will just buy it instead. Its called the inflation tax, IIRC. The BLS and the media will in the meantime keep cooking the inflation statistics and covering it all up."

So their projection is SP equal weighted index will grow at 8 and capweighted at 3. Their analysis is that market will adjust to lower multiple as we see realistically normal growth and not the high growth values given to these companies. The higher PE is a concern, as long as you think growth is linear. Growth is always slightly exponential, unless interrupted by war or large natural calamity. But now, I think we are going to see an exponential growth in top companies which will make bring the multiples down or which justify the higher multiples. We cannot compare it with historical data without accounting for the increasing growth rate. And the large concentration in top company may look strange, till you compare the world now and 2030 years back. The large companies today are more global than ever and have a bigger slice of overall activity in the world anyone looking for information, today does google search, whereas 20 years back he was going to different libraries and publications. Every companys datacenter is today concentrated into 4 cloud companies, so these cloud companies are going to be big part of economy and hence market. In this current time, concentration allows growth acceleration. However technology and market are changing so rapidly that concentration in market no longer means you have to be less competitive or survive in slower growth mode. With AI tech, we will see a growth acceleration that we have not seen since internet. In a decade. Productivity will be 3x of current, if not more. And the next AI companies will control an even bigger part of the overall work and hence the market. And the growth will be much faster than anything we have ever seen. And market will respond to higher growth by going higher. Ofcourse more money infusion into market, due to higher deficit will drive this number higher. IMHO, we will see atleast 1315 SP growth, but more likely 17 or higher."

The company I work for used to own Talen energy mentioned in this article the reason it was sold off is because it was just dead weight back then. Perfect example...at the Susquehanna plant mentioned, we had to keep two fleets of excavators on hand in case of a meltdown and pay for upkeep, maintenance, etc... It was literally redundancy for a black swan event, wild. This is the reason that Exelon has basically been the name in the game in nuke generation in the US. My old boss used to head up exelons nuke operations the only way they were able to make it profitable was through acquisition and absolutely ruthless standardization...they acquired a new plant and would implement the playbook...execsemployees who pushed back were gone. Same service intervals, same vendors for IT systems, same schemes, same excavator, same everything across the entire fleet. My company, as many others have long said nuke is the answer...with reasonable regulation. SMR and the involvement of big tech is bringing that conversation to the forefront. Nuke and nuke adjacent industries like utilities are great play at the moment. Same with NG, but thats a whole other discussion."

On top of that, the fact is the more you engage in a risky activity the greater the odds of something bad happening from said activity even if the odds are really really low. i.e. the average driver could correctly boast having a 100 safety record, but obviously youd rightly laugh in their face if they insisted that means theres zero chance that theyll ever get into a car accident. Even if you have a bunch of very safe drivers on the road, the more very safe drivers you have on the road the greater the odds that one of those very safe drivers will get into an accident, it happens every day because theres millions of them on the road.

They may have used the weak jobs report as an argument to favour the 50bp cut against those who are more hesitant but I doubt it was the deciding factor. The fact is inflation is pretty spot on where they would hope it would be. They wouldnt want it to be much lower right now, otherwise the risk of overshooting would look to great, with high interest rates still likely pressuring inflation downwards, with the effect lagging. The better than expected jobs report since shouldnt change their course of action as long as inflation continues to come in in line with expectations. The balancing act theyre trying to pull off is working out perfectly for them so far, and pausing cuts due to a healthy economy with inflation in the target range would make very little sense. They would be shooting themselves in the foot. Theyre just as aware of the risk of deflation and recession. Theyre close to pulling off their dream scenario"

Although quarter point is also possible. I think the most likely scenario is two quarter point cuts. As far as where the median lies, I dont understand your math. There arent 19 relevant people in the Fed. Nonvoters opinions dont matter they can talk all they want, but they dont set policy. The 12 votes that matter are here You can somewhat assume the 4 hawkish dots in the June dotplot are likely Bowman, Schmid, Bostic, and Kashkari. Of those, two are voting this year, and two are voting next year. So at best worst?, 2 of the 12 voting members of the Fed are effectively not in favor of cutting much further. Moreover, the 2025 Fed voting picture gets even more dovish since it brings in Goolsbee...youre going to have 4 doves, 2 hawks, and a middle that slides a bit more dovish."

Their dot plots were done before the strong data. That means they thought 5.5 was obviously way too high to warrant starting with 50 bps cut, but then 5.0 is somehow not that high to even warrant a cut? When youre talking about Fed medians, Im assuming youre talking about all officials. Among 2024 voters and 9 people who put in 3 cuts in 2024, Bowman, Bostic, Barkin, and Waller wouldve all preferred a 25 bps cut. Hammack was a voter, but no clear side from her yet. I was talking about Sept dot plot, not June dot plot. I dont know why youre bringing up June dot plot to describe voters in Sept. Also, that dovehawk spectrum is pretty wrong by the way. Kashkari has turned back into a dove already and thinks the risk shifts more towards weaker labor market. Barkin is the third most hawkish Fed member behind Schmid. Dalys a dove, and Wallers much more hawkish than Powell, who is now pretty much a dove. In fact, Waller probably sets the tone for where the hawks stand, which was why the Sept vote was very surprising because the Friday before the blackout period, Waller came out and didnt give forward guidance for a 50 bps cut, which caused even the most dovish forecasters like Citi to move to predicting 25bps cut. For 2025, you get Goolsbee but loses Daly. You get Collins which is pretty much centrist, and Hammack is unknown. Loses Bostic but gets Schmid, so its pretty much the same as 2024."

Whereas nothing is perfect, I found that cheat sheet to be relatively accurate. Daly isnt a dove...in fact, Ive seen Daly go back and forth quite a few times in sentiment, very similar to Powell and Williams, both of whom are fairly rated in the middleish. They all tend to be reactive more than proactive. The fact you call Powell a dove is nuts. If he was a dove, they would have cut a quarter point in June when they should have. Hes _very_ clearly more weighted towards overvaluing the inflation side of their dualmandate. Waller may be a _touch_ too dovish on the chart, but marginally...hes nowhere near the Kashkari range. Hes probably somewhere between Barkin and Bostic. At that rate, youre really splitting hairs though. For 2025, I still disagree. Losing Daly, who is close to the middle, is not the same as gaining Goolsbee. When it comes down to it, I kinda view it like the Supreme Court...BowmanBosticSchmidKashkari are your AlitoThomases...you know what theyre going to do before they vote. Kugler, Barr, Goolsbee, and Cook are like Sotomayor...you know what theyre going to do before they vote. Everybody else is somewhere around the Roberts area...their opinions are going to ebb and flow based on prevailing data Daly being in that crosssection. Gaining a Goolsbee and losing a Daly is a distinct dovish shift...its a shift from a situational dove to a definite dove."

I dont care what he said 12 months ago, because were talking about the present. If you want to talk about the past, why stop at 12 months. Go back 6 years, when he was the most dovish member. If you listened to Daly talk at all, youd see she clearly shifts more towards protecting the labor market. Shes a labor economist by training, and frequently talks about the hardship of lower class workers. Of course shes gonna lean towards protecting the labor market, which hits the lower class the most in recessions. Powell is CLEARLY a dove now. Look at his Jackson Hole speech. He was obviously pressuring the hawks in the committee towards a cut. Whenever Powell speaks at the FOMC or Jackson Hole, he has to represent the whole community, not just his own opinion. The fact that he declared definitively the Fed was cutting when several hawks were still on the fence, and then chimed in his own dovish opinions on a platform where he was representing the whole committee hawks and doves showed he was trying to steer the committee towards him. Even in July FOMC before the weak job report, you could see he was leaning towards a cut when the labor market was supposedly super strong, but couldnt convince the committee to get on board. Hes been itching to cut since July, easily just a notch below Goolsbee, and thats only because he has to represent the whole committee. Barkin is just as hawkish as Kashkari 6 months ago. He rarely talks about inflation progress, and is always cautious that businesses have shifted towards raising price first mindset. He doesnt even want to go back to neutral rate yet, which means he still thinks the risk leans towards higher inflation. In fact, they were frequently among the most hawkish dot plots along with BullardMesterBowman, and BosticWaller 1 notch below them. Waller was always saying the labor market is strong and theres no rush to cut in all his speech. No one knows what Barr will do. Barr doesnt talk about the economy much.

I mean hes pretty much a hawkish meme on the internet with his crazy eyes. Is it possible his view radically shifted again? Absolutely. But I dont believe it yet. On Powell, I still disagree. His talk didnt talk dovish until after the June jobs report, when it became club over the head obvious to everyone Kashkari included. Powell talked very hawkish up to the point, including in his response to questions at the FOMC. In general, looking back at the FOMC meets, he would very easily dismiss weakening labor market news and trends and be very quick to latch onto even a subtle shift in inflation numbers. Like inflation would have 1 month of surprise upsurge and he would insist they need 3 more months of good inflation data before they can think of cutting. And if another upsurge happened in those 3 months, hed reset the 3 month counter. That went on nearly all year, fully ignorant of the trendline. And the inverse was true of jobs. Like you would see this clear upward trend in unemployment that he would fully ignore, pointing to the fact it went down in like a single recent report. I could very easily see Powell looking at the recent 254k jobs report, freaking out, and returning to his hawkish talk needing more data, having plenty of time to wait, pausing w tools to respond. Thats his MO...overreact to a single recent event and be slow to react to broader trends. At any rate, agree to disagree on this one, but you have fair points."

He chose to signal a rate cut in Dec 2023 when financial condition was already overpricing Fed cuts, and after financial condition had loosened a lot a month prior. He chose to dismiss the hot inflation prints in Q1 2024 as noise until the third hot print where he basically couldnt dismiss it anymore. He acknowledged that therere seasonal factors that artificially bring up inflation early in the year and bring down inflation later in the year. If this is what he believes in, he should slowly cut until early next year and observe what inflation does, not start with 50 bps cut. Theres also the new president next year which would be inflationary no matter what, so that further adds reasons to go slow and wait until next year. Unemployment rate going up is due to more labor supply, not layoffs. Whats the rush in that? Unemployment was going up for months while we continued to add 250k jobs, and everyone was saying nothing but positive things about the economy. We only shifted down to 150k jobs for 2 months and now suddenly the labor market is weak? Consumer spending is strong, job confidence is strong. If there was any real risk of recession, economists and the market wouldve already flagged that, but none have so far. Btw, a dove focuses more on the job mandate, and a hawk focuses more on the inflation mandate. It doesnt matter what the reason for their focuses are, but Kashkari is now a much bigger dove than the rest when the rest of them saw the same data. Same with Powell."

Hell, the whole reason the stock market would tank after each Fed meeting is because people kept expecting the dovish cuts are coming soon convo and hed stubbornly stick to hawkish dont even think about it, we need more data, promptly causing a rapid sell off in equities. The market was overpricing cuts because they literally were ignoring the words coming out of his mouth. Even as late as the June meeting, it was hawkish words To quote the above link For a seventh straight meeting, the FOMCs statement repeats language stating that the committee doesnt expect to cut rates until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2. Powell doubled down on the dot plots hawkish tone at the press conference, proclaiming, If the economy remains solid and inflation continues to persist, we are prepared to maintain the current rate level. If the labor market were to weaken significantly...we are prepared to respond Thats literally the exact same stance he was running for 7 meetings prior hold rates steady, wait for data. There wasnt a hint of dovishness there. He doesnt say anything like were preparing to cut soon. That didnt come until Jackson Hole following the dismal June jobs report. On the labor market, it is weak, but macroeconomics dont turn on a dime. Show me any time in history on this chart where the unemployment rate starts turning upward and then stops or declines after only three quarters of a percentage point You wont find it. Sentiment and trends are long term glacierlike snowballing effects. Its why you cant see a recession until youre in it. Because if all youre focusing on is present data whilst ignoring a clearly developing trend, youll never see it. Sure, the labor market is fine now. But thats not what Im concerned about. Do you ever wonder why the Fed is always behind the curve and seems to miss the boat all the time? Always reacting and cleaning up messes after economy implosions instead of being ahead of the ball? This is why. Theyre going to see that most recent 254k jobs report and go look, everything is fine, we can maintain the rate. Then the next month the jobs report is going to be adjusted or abysmal, and once again theyll be behind the curve. Honestly, for entities that constantly claim to care about longterm data, Im shocked at how shortterm thinking they truly are. Inflation has been on a clear downward trend since at least August 2023, and only now they start releasing the screws? When were only a half percent above 2 CPE?"

                    "text": "your quote is not a hawkish quote. It is a neutral quote. A hawkish quote would not include the latter part where they are prepared to respond swiftly to deteriorating labor market, which is what Powell did in 2023, not mentioning any concern for the labor market. Please interpret the quote yourself instead of relying on someone else to do it for you. The FOMC statement is crafted by the WHOLE committee, not Powell alone. The dot plot was hawkish in June, but Powell was not. Powell only has control in the FOMC QA. If you think dovish signal can only come from were preparing to cut soon, youre not following the FOMC that closely. Powell can signal dovishness by what he choose to say or not say, what he chooses to emphasize. For example, therere 2 conditions for him to cut rates falling inflation, deterioration of labor market. Only 1 condition for him to HOLD rates, not even hike higher inflation. That right there shows a HUGE dovish bias, and he made this shift late last year. This is evident in the financial condition, which was the tightest late last year and have eased down to summer 2022 levels. Sp500 rallied 300 points after June FOMC. Not sure where the selloffs youre talking about are. The only time the market sold off this year due to hawkish Fed was in April after 3 consecutive bad inflation prints, but not during FOMC. Any instance when unemployment turns upwards and then stop? Summer 2023. Remember when all the recession forecasts became soft landing forecast? Or you already forgot. initial claims also spiked back then too. But why does it matter. Unemployment rate is spiking due to labor supply, not firing. Show me any instance in the past when unemployment rate spiked up due to labor supply."

                    "text": "That quote is only a neutral quote if were at a neutral rate. Powell himself claims the rate we were at prior to the recent half point cut was a significantly restrictive rate, with the rate were at now still restrictive even after the cut. When we get to 2 inflation, we should ideally at that point be at a neutral rate. Because of that reason, the quote is hawkish. Its ignoring the data, ignoring the trend, and preparing forassuming the worst i.e. inflation to reinflate. A neutral stance would have reacted to falling inflation by slowly reducing the rate restriction so that we would be near a neutral rate near the same time we hit 2 inflation. That is not going to happen. Were going to hit 2 CPE within months and wont be anywhere near a neutral rate until sometime in 2026 per even the latest dot plot. Unemployment didnt go anywhere in summer of 2023. That entire time unemployment was in the 3.4 3.8 range and effectively moved sideways. Mainly because we had slack from tons of job openings to absorb any declines in business activity. That buffer has all but evaporated at this point Future weakening in the job market wont come from unfilled openings, itll come from actual filled job positions. As can be seen from the upwardly trending unemployed per job opening chart I also dont know why you seem to believe that the only reason unemployment is trending up is due to supply. There are many sectors in our economy that are laying off people left and right. Tech is one of the big ones Other industries are slow to follow because companies are still afraid to release their workers after the acute shortage they just went through in the proceeding years. So they are choosing to hold workers at a loss rather than release them. At some point those fears will subside. Consumer spending has been declining through all of 2024 and people are becoming increasingly selective about where they spend their money, particularly on big ticket items. Hell, the automobile market all but collapsed people just arent buying cars anymore. Until I see any of these trends break, Im going to assume theyre going to continue. Im seeing a consumer tightening their belt more and more with every passing day, and companies downsizing more and more every passing day."

                    "text": "Kind of disagree. The consumer is sick of the Starbucks ripoff. Theyre looking for value, not sweet drinks that cost as much as a meal. Id been skeptical that just tweaks could fix that. I do believe making some big and fundamental and newsgenerating changes could fix Starbucks business. I also believe the small tweaks wont do anything. Seeing that 4 point letter from Niccol screams tweaks not true fundamental change. Its as much BS corpospeak as what Laxman was putting out. Empower the barista. Please. Ive read the employeedominated sub, and the theme is theyre sick of being worked to death and it sounds like many dont even like the customers. Understand the market isnt exactly a forensic fix for China. Customers tired of being ripped off dont need to be told the Starbucks story. The name on cups gag is played out. Making Starbucks a community coffeehouse isnt really what consumers want, and isnt necessarily good for the business. They want better value and they want to get in and out quickly. The 25 pop was the market assuming Niccol could make the inandout quickly thing, and the perceived value thing happen. This letter sounds like he doesnt even understand the problem. And the market annointing him as universal problem solving saint may be misguided. Yes, CMG stock had incredible growth and the brand became widely loved... for the first half of his tenure. But the second half is not as pretty. When problems started to appear, he seemed incapable of identifying and addressing them proactively. Chipotle is now widely perceived as being a ripoff and too bland. Bad portion sizes. Skimping on ingredients and quality. He seemed paralyzed and clueless about that. His last big public appearance before abandoning the ship was him goofily claiming the portions were consistent, as big as your head, and that if you ever felt you werent getting value, you should personally try to shame the worker into topping up your plate. Thats out of touch, not problem solving. So a perhaps more sober assessment of Niccol is that he was present while CMG rode the advantage of the stock being pummeled from killing customers with unsafe food, and then when the time came to actually solve problems, he couldnt recognize them let alone solve them. And now hes the one walking into a problemfest at Starbucks. I took my 24 gains and am waiting to see what happens. If I were given that job, instead of issuing that bad, pithy letter, heres what Id do acknowledge the deep problems which are a consumer no longer willing to pay luxury price for sugary milkshakes, employees placed in unfulfilling situations, operational inability to have quick, high volume output. fixes would be in the form of Big Bang changes and candid humility. Look to the dominos model where they apologized and acknowledged cardboard level pizza. Fix the bad, burnt coffee taste perception. look also to McDonalds who knows you have to keep volume going even when consumers are strapped and sick of you, and they do that with inarguably value through literal value menus. Id have some newsgenerating low priced options as a form of Starbucks value menu look also to McDonalds who figured out how to massively pump out drive through where your order is prepared in the time it takes between ordering and paying and pickup window, and then making that parallel with two or more lanes. Id overhaul the operations substantially. Despite what coffeehouse baristas think, efficient machines can make most of a drink just fine. Weve all had delicious mass produced smoothies, Nespressos, etc. Id lean heavy on such automation and preparation to massively ramp up how much and how quickly a location can pump out the drinks, and let the baristas be more of a presentation element. Let them use their time and personalities with the customers instead of tamping away and washing seives in the back. Yes, Id be fine with a scenario where premade or machine made drinks are pumped out under a counter and a charming baritas focus on pretending they made it and making the customer feel happy and that theyve been served quickly. Make it globally known that the long lineups are over and that you can get a plain coffee for 3 from the value menu. this would address both the biggest consumer deterrents plus make life liveable for the baristas. it turns Starbucks back into a perceived affordable treat, an attainable piece of luxury at a good price. Theres more, but you get the point. Sure, theres a halo on Niccol, and a whole ecosystem of Wall Street and financial news media that is invested in claiming Starbucks is great regardless of the truth. But in terms of actual transformational change, my plan seems to have more substance than tell the Starbucks story"

I cant say if theyre going bankrupt again, but I personally wouldnt ever invest in company thats so short sighted that its flirting with bankruptcy a few years after exiting bankruptcy. Edit I decided to dig into the specifics more. The company has written down or sold for a loss about 467 million of their EV inventory since 1223. Of note, they still have EVs, but I couldnt find the specifics on how much they have left. I dont think theyll go bankrupt soon, based on their debt maturities, but I wouldnt be suprised if they filed in 34 years based on their terrible decision making. Theyve put themselves in a pretty big hole."

Itll be nice when it gets back to the view that the majority of these situations are genuinely bad companies and the that are actually worthwhile turnarounds is probably low single digit at best. Is it going to 0? Quite possible. Could it short squeeze? Sure, 30 short interest but that would likely require good news and the news earlier this week that it was ruled that Hertz underpaid bond holders post prior bankruptcy by 270M is definitely not positive. Im sure that will be appealed, but if they have to pay 270M at this point after the decline in the business that its had in recent years, that will be a problem. They are trading at 3usd as of writing this and its so far down over the past few years it looks like its on a path to 0. I mean, were talking about a company that went public again in 2021 after bankruptcy and has proceeded to lose about 87.5 since in pretty much a straight line as someone else noted, the move into EVs went very poorly and certainly didnt help. Completely agree with this from the same person I personally wouldnt ever invest in company thats so short sighted that its flirting with bankruptcy a few years after exiting bankruptcy. Maybe its not a straight line for the stock from here to 0 but it 0ing again would not surprise me at all."

How is it that IBRXs accumulated deficit of 3.2 billion is more than half of SoonShiongs net worth, if he didnt deliberately saddle it with debt Im not saying he did Im just asking? 2. If IBRX only has enough cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through at least 12 months, doesnt that mean a share dilution is very likely in the near future? Wouldnt IBRX be cutting things a bit close if they dont do it within the next 3 months? 3. The stock price is lower today than it was when the FDA approval was given. What does this mean for sales? Does it for example mean that other drugs are being preferred, over Anktiva? Does it mean that Anktivas efficacy has been exaggerated, since its not effective on its own but has to be taken alongside BCG? 4. Which other drugs are competing with Anktiva in the treatment of NMIBC, and how do their sales compare with those of Anktiva? 5. Are there any official dates or timelines by which UK approval is expected? 6. You say his plane has been at Heathrow Airport for this month. Is it likely that he is pushing for UK approval, so he can then announce some shares dilution?"

Trials are extremely expensive, I believe 505k 150k per participant., depending on the type of drugtreatment. 2. Yes. Share dilution is possible. However, it is my opinion the will partner to create liquidity. Soon owns 80 of the stock, so he has in interest too. 3. Look at Akebia, Iovance, Coherus, Xfor and others that had PDUFAapproval. Approval means nothing, IBRX was in the luxury position of being able to ship 2 weeks after approval. Unique. However, the market still needs to be informed, trained, insurance deals covered. An approval, as with the given examples, are in indication of future value. Especially when it does not concern Big Pharma. 4. Keytruda and Opdivo I believe. If you look at Opdivo wiki, you can see a approval path I think Anktiva has the same timeline. 5. UK is my guess. Not fact. It is simply logic. The fastest to obtain. 6. UK approval, in my opinion, will go with a partnership. I do not see how they can not. If they do not partner, they will need to dilute. With Bio stock anything is possible. You have to be willing to see red. A partner can bee in many forms, but if this occurs there will be a big investment my guess 500,000,000 minimum and hefty milestone payments for each indication."

If by bio business you mean biotechs as a whole, well nobody is ever going to be familiar with all of them, and each biotech has its own idiosyncracies and unique selling points. Therefore, we ALL need to read about bio business. Also, as far as getting familiar is concerned, asking questions here is actually part of getting familiar with the sector and learning more about it. Nobody has a monopoly on knowledge. 2 Big Pharma and biotechs are not the same thing. A financial win for a Biotech company may barely move the financial needle for a Big Pharma company thats worth multiples of billions, depending on the amount of sales of the drug. If a biotechs drug is not the only drug on the market for a given illness, the money made from that drugs market share will be limited, since the Total Addressable Market will be shared with the competing drugs. There are also drugs that most of the public who need them will never see, due to the unfortunate fact that those drugs are too expensive to be massproduced for the wider market. 3 A companys revenue is very different from its stock price action. Even when a drug is sold to the public, it isnt guaranteed to translate to significant stock price increase. If a biotechs stock price doesnt move much, then that biotech isnt attractive to private investors, even if it remains desirable for a big pharma company to invest in it."

A year ago at this time of year, the threemonth average of nonfarm job creation was at 211k, and now its only 116k 142k in August, and the longterm norm is about 190k per month. At the same time, the data for June and July were revised sharply downward by 30 or minus 86k from 293k total for the two months to 207k employed. Its still better to count in percentages, as as the economy and population grows, you need more and more employment growth in absolute terms to have a commensurate effect. The 3month average is 0.07 per month, the YTD average is 0.11, and the 12month average is 0.12, while the mediumterm rate before COVID 20172019 was 0.13 per month and the 10year longterm rate is 0.16. The visible deterioration started in June and the data is about half as bad as the longterm trend in job creation. Its not a crisis requires at least three months of job contraction or a recession a rate of about 0.03 per month averaged over 36 months, but the first clear signal. It should be taken into account that BLS manipulates data and recently lost over 800 thousand employed, yesterday they revised the data for the worse by 30 and it is not excluded that soon we will find out that all this is a complete fake and the economy is in recession since spring 2024. Its important to note the structural degradation Native American workers have lost about 1.5 million jobs since the beginning of 2020, replaced by over 3 million migrants mostly from Mexico. More than 2 million parttime lowwage jobs have gained over the past year with nearly 1.5 million fulltime jobs lost. Where is the job growth concentrated? Over the past year, 85 of service sector jobs were in health care, trade, food service and entertainment mostly lowpaying jobs, while IT is cutting employment and banks and professional and business services the highest paying have the smallest rate of growth since early 2008. All signs point to a dip into recession soon."

Most retail trading on the market, is no different than playing poker or sports betting. 90 of traders dont know what an edge even is, and they are timing the market the way someone predicts a roulette table.

Nope gotta send an 4th and sacrifice ann entire tv set to replace the door. 4th arrives and the wood door had a manufacturing flaw where one door was cut about an inch shorter that the other. It was a mess, and having to return the set each time wasnt easy as it was a two person job to move the box.

In 2007, GDP growth was about 1.9 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA. Recent Years 2023 GDP growth has varied in recent years due to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and subsequent recovery. For example, in 2021, GDP grew by about 5.7, driven by recovery from the pandemic, but this growth rate has moderated since then, with GDP growth in 2023 estimated to be around 2 to 2.5. 2007 Wage growth was relatively stagnant before the recession. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS, real wage growth was minimal, with nominal wages increasing modestly but often outpaced by inflation. GDP Growth The growth rate of GDP in 2007 was lower compared to some recent years, especially during the postpandemic recovery. However, recent growth rates are beginning to resemble the moderate growth seen in 2007 as the economy stabilizes. Wage Growth Real wage growth has been more pronounced recently due to labor market pressures, but inflation has also been higher, which complicates direct comparisons. In 2007, wage growth was weaker, with stagnant real wages being a concern leading up to the recession. Recent Years 2023 Wage growth has been more dynamic in recent years, partly due to labor shortages and inflation pressures. In 2022, nominal wages increased by about 5 on average, though real wage growth adjusted for inflation has been mixed. Some quarters saw real wage declines due to high inflation, while other periods showed modest real gains. Deregulation of the financial industry led to those GOP caused recessions, then we need to either reinstate the regulations they repealed or make new ones, they hurt us more than help us every time they hold the presidency."

Real wage growth is 1.5 or so over the past 4 years, hardly anything impressive but at least it barely exceeds inflation at least the official CPI Im all for optimism but I just dont buy the argument that our numbers mean we are basically guaranteed to not be heading for a downturn. Thats not a robust argument. Recessions dont just appear out of nowhere. We typically start with a robust looking, heated economy and very low unemployment, and then hey! Unemployment rises, bankruptcies spike and consumption falls over. This is the business cycle. If we trigger the sahm rule in the next couple of employment reports, and or the yield curve steepens further, Im sorry, historically speaking it would be pretty much unprecedented to not have a recession.

On the military side, eVTOLs arent just about sustainabilitythey offer unique advantages like vertical takeoff and easier deployment in tight spaces, plus potentially lower maintenance.

The military interest isnt just about replacing current aircraft but adding new flexibility, like silent, quick deployments in areas where larger VTOLs might struggle. As for the infrastructure, its a major hurdle, no doubt, but those are exactly the problems the industry is trying to solve stepbystep, starting with key locations rather than going global all at once.

If the position is just held under your name, the expected contribution is far, far lower, about 5.64. Keep it in your name and gift it after they graduate. Heres the important difference between the two with regards to financial aid the FAFSA assesses independent student assets at 20 but parent assets which includes assets owned by a student who is still a dependent on a bracketed system at a maximum rate of 5.64.3 In other words, the SAI calculation assumes that 20 of the students assets will be used to pay for schooling while only 5.64 of a parents assets will."

However, since you are in Switzerland you might want to have a look at ZKB gold etf as their gold is backed physically in their vault rather than backed physically by a collateralised debt obligation 3 I wouldnt but I would ask advised to an independent financial adviser consulente finanziario indipendente. 4 I would have some bond even if in small amount since interest rate are still like this 5 I would keep 5 of my position in Bitcoin This is my view, hope it helps"

In any case being fiscally resident in Switzerland I can not use the source tax as an Italian resident. Furthermore, Id like to avoid moving money periodically between here and there. Even if my situation is fully compliant with the regulations, its always tricky and I prefer to avoid any issue. Invesco Physical Gold was my initial choice. I checked out the ZKB you mentioned, for sure it looks interesting but in terms of TER is much higher 0.40 vs 0.12. Do you think its worth the difference for being keep physically in reserve? Concerning bond you still talk about ETF of specific bonds? Open to any additional info. Lastly on Bitcoin, yes I think as well its an hedging asset in case of future unknown situation. For this also I opened IBKR as it allow to trade BTC as well. Thanks again."

If you keep Euro I would keep a Euro gov bond etf 01 And a medium duration one always Euro gov bond 37 If usd the Ill keep usd treasury etf 37 and some short 01 Yes IBKR does allow you to get bitcoin but you wont be able to move it out of IBKR so in case in the future you need that to move it to a different country you wont be able to do so....

Started a 529 investment account for education expenses. The key benefit is tax free withdrawal. These started as college only accounts. Federal law changes have been made over the years allowing these accounts to be used for precollege education expenses, but not all states allow this. The downside of this is the money can only be used for education and related expenses. 2. Started a custodialtrust account for long term stock investment. Normal tax rules apply. The money can be used for anything. Considerations Kids are not the best at rational decision making at 18. For this reason a trust account may help you provide some oversight of the funds use. 3. A custodial account for the kids personal savings. I set this up with them to teach financial literacy. I just did this for my kids last week now that theyre both preteenteens. We discuss the benefits of investing, approaches, help them identify opportunities, and help them make the transactions. Why 3 approaches? I first set up 529 accounts because the tax benefits are great. As life went on I realized that going to college isnt the norm it used to be. My wife and I expect our kids to go to college and beyond ideally, but if they decide to go another route then I didnt want all their savings to be locked up in a 529. After discussing this with my wife we started the trust fund brokerage accounts to counter balance the 529 contributions we make. Any gift money the kids receive we throw in their trust brokerage account. Both accounts are about even at this point. Clearly the earlier you start the better. The custodial brokerage accounts I just set up are education focused. Ive read too many stories about kids being financially illiterate. If I made the effort to set them up for success I didnt want them to squander it. Education is the key so I figured getting them taking part and building their interest as teens was a smart way to go. One thing for you to factor in... Change. Be ready for it. Kids personalities and needs vary. Economic societal shifts are happening all the time. Investing is easier but also prone to be abused like social media. College used to be the way... now there are boot camps for kids to concentrate on one thing and bypass a 4 year degree. A kid may decide being a plumber is a noble profession and have no interest in college. God forbid your child may have health or education issues. Use of the money is impossible to predict and if you or your spouses expectations are locked in you might have a challenging time down the road. Food for thought."

Put the rest into a long term savings brokerage account. Reasonable college fund amounts vary. My goal is about 75 of tuition, room, and board at a state school. The rest my daughter will be responsible for. This means she has personal financial investment into her education and there is room for merit based scholarships. It also isnt an amount so large that its prohibitive to gift it to her later on say, when she graduates and gets her first job. Also fully fund your retirement first. Anything you put into a custodial account will be fully accessible to your child between 1821. Adults at those ages have significant challenges with impulse control and have a none zero chance of spending it all before they are 25. You will probably be able to better support your childs financial freedom if you have ensured your own first and then help them with lifes biggest financial challenges as they mature. Help them buy their first car, pay most but not all of their college tuition, help them with their first down payment on a house.

Youre right that biotech investing can be particularly risky and challenging, especially with the influx of new companies during the COVID19 pandemic. The oversupply of biotech firms has indeed made fundraising more competitive. I appreciate your suggestion to look into IBRX ImmunityBio. Evaluating companies like IBRX for their costs, timelines, and debt can provide valuable perspective on the current biotech landscape. Understanding the financial and operational aspects of established players can help gauge the potential challenges and opportunities for emerging ventures. Dr. Henry E. Youngs research is still in its early stages, and we are aware that biotech investments carry significant risks. However, the focus on developing 3D growth plate implants could offer unique benefits and applications, which might set it apart from more conventional approaches. Thank you again for your advice.

For example, buy a 12 month LEAP on whatever youre interested in, if it moves in your way, sell a shorter expiry against it.

Im looking at the UI, which just lists the values in a grid, and thinking after I add the effective date to the grid how do I allow the user to add a new line with values where they can just change the effective date and one or two of the values on the line. Finally decided I would get a pic of a calendar, shrink it down to an icon, stick that on the end of the grid next to the icon that adds a blank line, so that when they click on the calendar it copies that line and adds it to the end of the grid, then I decided Id fill in the effective date with todays date, put the focus on that, so that theyd get a line with all the values copied and be able to change the effective date first, and then go and edit the rest of the values as needed. So an AI is going to be told to add an effective date and heres the UI. Figure it out. Somehow I dont see it coming up with a userfriendly solution. It would actually have to be a human with eyes and fingers to know to design the UI so that at a glance the user will know what to do. I could give the AI the task of writing the code to copy the line after the icon is pressed, but thats a trivial thing that takes me a minute to write. Its the figuring out how to present it to the user in a fashion they can understand that takes the time."

Much like in traditional search results, data coming from sources like Wikipedia, major news outlets, scientific papers and think tanks is likely to yield more accurate and useful results. AI companies know this and they assign greater weight to the tokenized text from highquality sources. As LLMs get larger, they are more likely to scrape outdatedirrelevant data from places like arguments on old gaming forums, Reddit satire, or PornHub comments. The more bad data they include, the more likelihood of hallucinations incomplete or incorrect data. The same methodology applies to code found online. Sites like W3 Schools, Stack Overflow, MSDN, Google opensource, SourceForge and highlystarred entries from GitHub are very useful, but these are already incorporated into most LLMs. Adding older and less well moderated code wont improve things much, and may actually make the results worse. Hackers might even post malicious code snippets to trick LLMs into suggesting them to users. Quality of data isnt the only improvement that AI companies could make, however. They could tweak their algorithms to detect obvious bugs or hacks prior to delivering them, for example. They also might be able to detect when a given code block obviously wont compile or is referencing a library that has been replaced. These are tweaks, however. It is still garbage ingarbage out. In the long term, AI will likely win out. A system that is always getting better will eventually overtake a system that is static the human brain. The question is, how long?

Holy crap thats so far outside its capabilities I dont even know where to start. If AI can do what you do at your job, that says more about what you do than what AI can do. AI cannot do what I do, and it isnt close. Ive tried. Ive put lots of effort into trying to make this work. And it can only do the most trivial tasks, like making a reddit scraper or creating permutations of a unit test, or generating documentation boilerplate for you to then manually edit. And thats really the key here, is that even in the best case, what AI produces is still below my standards and I have to manually edit it. And then theres the problem of it only being good at the languages that have lots and lots of examples to scrape. Python and Java? Fine. C? A little less so.

The AI result generates code that looks like it could work, but uses a library javax.xml.validation that was deprecated years ago and would likely fail a security audit we run automated audits of every library every night. If you then change the searchprompt to validate xml against xsd in java using jakarta specifying a newer library, all it does is replace javax. with jakarta. in the code. The underlying interfaces have changed, so the resulting code wont compile and is worse than starting from a blank slate.

I mean yeah, AI can now create like buzzfeed and watchmojo music but consumers get annoyed by that now. Plus the music industry is going to get the generative music programs shut down for sure. The lawyers are arguing its copyright infringement to train the AI on music catalogues, and one thing to know about the music industry vs. innovation war that has been going on the last 100 or so years, is that the music industry almost always gets their cut of any new way music is listened to or produced."

Machine learning, which is a segment of the AI space, is absolutely concerning. This is field data study. Its the idea that I can take all the decisions you guys have made over the last decade in a piece of software and apply a machine learning algo to that field of data so I then can make assumptions based on what actual humans did. This is how we get an LLM, but its also how we automate a dock or Fiverr. We have to teach the machine to replace the human, but make no mistake.. machine learning is a drive forward in the realm of replacing humans with machines. Machine learning in industrial and commercial settings is a concern for every worker on earth, whether you understand it or not, because they are already replacing humans with these machines and were just getting started. Regardless of if you think itll work or not, they do think itll work, and they will still till they know it wont. And since the tech grows while they implement it, its highly likely that it will fill a ton of needs humans filled traditionally. Another important caveat is that Nvidia has produced chipsets that can handle massive ML implementations. That chipset is the size of a desktop computer now smaller even. Weve had ML for a long time now, we just never had an affordable parser you could slap into any office on earth. As we speak, I am capable of replacing all of my regular dd friends with machine learning. Microsoft offers tech that allows me to capture their mannerisms and speech within moments of hearing their voice. OpenAi and others offer tools to parse the collected data, building my own AI from the recorded dd sessions. A year or two at work here and I could legitimately play dd with all my buddies without any of them being there and it would be very much like they were actually there. Perfect? No. But it doesnt need to be to get shit done. i learned all this tech from here I wanted to build a listener that took all the daily standups in wallstreetbets back when we had them here on Reddit and then parsed all the audio down into possible plays.. like an hour of conversation would be like 30 tickers and sectors and etc, with some collective sentiment for each. I wanted to capture all this and boil it down to ticker sentiment. In that endeavor, I found Microsofts offering I refered to above as well as most of the stuff Im talking about here. Had to know what options I had to really do the thing. I never finished this project, but wsb effectively taught me all this. Small world. Its important to understand that simulating the DM in that circumstance is far harder than simulating the players. Im also capable of creating a digital infinite storybook. For every new page you turn, you will see new art and new story relative to the story as it has been told thus far, but this new page didnt exist until the moment you turned to it.. and I can generate infinite new pages. This is a literal infinite storybook. We can make this today and it will be really fkn cool. Youre welcome for the idea if you steal it. Throw me 1m for every 10 you make and well call it even. This is wsb. I will sue you if you build this because this comment is timestamped. Also, consider this. Even if the ML implemention messed up 5 of the time, thats still within the margin of error for human operation, so its acceptable that it isnt perfect. Plus, if the machine fucks up 5, it doesnt lose an arm in those instances and workers comp never happens."

In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is. The value is added by gas centrifuging UF6. Only governments can do that."

Westinghouse stake, which is important imo if we want to play value investor and talk about EVEBITDA comparables etc. Nuclear trade all about vibesreflexivity and while this trade can certainly work, a confusing Brookfield family stonk seems like more of a heavy lift bc of complexity for less upside vs clean setup like LEU or just riding current winners after they cool off.

Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK. Among nonauthoritarian countries in the last couple of decades, only South Korea has managed to build large nuclear reactors on a reasonable budget and schedule.

So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid i.e. majority of energy demand then large reactors are the way to go. The actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 57 data centers of 5 GW power each. That would take roughly 35 large power reactors. And they are just talking about what OpenAI wants. Microsoft just struck a deal to reopen a nuclear plant in NY as well."

The completion of Units 3 and 4 made Vogtle the largest clean energy generation site in the US as well as the largest energy generation site of any kind in the US. The cost of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not the correct anchor point for estimating additional AP1000s given costs that should not be incurred again. Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs. From page 4th. Notice they modeled the costs of future builds with the AP1000s and not any other design because they are keen on building AP1000s.

Looking at BEPCs Q2 results nuclearWestinghouse revenues are described to fall under the Distributed Energy Storage line item, which was 61 million out of 830 million total 2024 revenue at the time of the report. I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price. Edit 2 So Ive learned in this article on the Westinghouse fraud case that they were paid 600 million for construction work in 201617.. so if BEPC gets 51 of something in that ballpark for multiple units, yeah could be huge for the SP Id imagine...

Basically every plant built in the 70s and 80s in the US had huge overruns, and many were cancelled after TMI. Even Watts Bar took much longer to complete than expected. Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different.

I did learn in further reading after this comment though that Westinghouse revenue will no longer include construction work, as some press releases I read excluded that from their business model when discussing the CCJBEPC acquisition. I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company. I wish I would have gone with my gut last month and bought CCJ 60 calls, as those would already be printing now. Instead I stayed on the sidelines smh. Still considering getting in on CCJ now though."

I dont have a specific issue to point to other than to ask why more people in the US arent building AP1000s currently and why the Vogtle units cost so much. Probably a good amount of mismanagement by Westinghouse and their construction contractors but also the costs of complying with regulatory scrutiny are high as well. Given that it is nuclear I think a good amount of scrutiny is warranted but maybe its a little overboard. Maybe the ADVANCE Act will help things along though, remains to be seen."

                    "text": "I used an expensive ChatGPT preview credit and got this reply Historically, when a major hurricane hits Florida, certain types of stocks tend to experience a surge due to increased demand for their products and services during the recovery and rebuilding phases. Below are the types of stocks that have historically gone up following significant hurricanes in Florida, supported by data and examples. 1. Home Improvement Retailers Companies Home Depot HD, Lowes Companies LOW Example After Hurricane Irma in September 2017, both Home Depot and Lowes saw a significant increase in sales. According to their quarterly reports, Home Depots samestore sales rose by 7.9, and Lowes saw a 5.7 increase, attributed largely to hurricanerelated purchases. Reason Hurricanes cause extensive property damage, leading homeowners and contractors to purchase building materials, tools, and supplies for repairs and rebuilding. 2. Construction and Building Materials Suppliers Companies Vulcan Materials Company VMC, Martin Marietta Materials MLM Example PostHurricane Michael in October 2018, Vulcan Materials reported a 15 increase in shipments to Florida in the following quarter. Reason The demand for construction aggregates like crushed stone, sand, and gravel spikes as rebuilding efforts commence. 3. Generator Manufacturers Companies Generac Holdings Inc. GNRC Example After Hurricane Irma, Generacs stock price increased by over 20 within a month. The company reported a surge in sales of portable and home standby generators. Reason Power outages lead to increased purchases of generators for both residential and commercial use. 4. Waste Management and Debris Removal Companies Waste Management Inc. WM, Clean Harbors Inc. CLH Example Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Waste Management secured numerous contracts for debris removal, boosting their revenues in the subsequent quarters. Reason Hurricanes generate vast amounts of debris that require prompt and extensive cleanup efforts. 5. Construction Equipment Rental Companies Companies United Rentals Inc. URI, HE Equipment Services HEES Example In the aftermath of Hurricane Wilma in 2005, United Rentals saw a notable uptick in equipment rentals in Florida, as per their annual report. Reason Contractors need additional equipment to handle the increased workload during rebuilding phases. 6. Roofing and Building Product Manufacturers Companies Owens Corning OC, Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. BECN Example Owens Corning reported a 12 increase in roofing material sales after Hurricane Irma, according to their 2017 annual report. Reason Roof damage is one of the most common issues after a hurricane, leading to higher demand for roofing materials. 7. Lumber and Wood Product Companies Companies Weyerhaeuser Company WY, LouisianaPacific Corporation LPX Example PostHurricane Katrina in 2005 while not in Florida, the trend is similar, lumber prices spiked, benefiting companies like Weyerhaeuser. Reason Rebuilding efforts require large quantities of lumber, driving up demand and prices. 8. Homebuilders Specializing in Renovations Companies Masco Corporation MAS, PulteGroup Inc. PHM Example Masco Corporation saw increased orders for cabinetry and plumbing products after hurricanes due to home renovations. Reason Homeowners often take the opportunity to upgrade or remodel damaged homes during repairs. Data and Reports Supporting These Trends Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA Reports Indicate billions of dollars are allocated for rebuilding, which funnels into these sectors. National Association of Home Builders NAHB Notes spikes in construction activity posthurricanes. Stock Performance Analysis Historical stock data shows upward trends for these companies in the months following major hurricanes. Considerations Insurance Companies While it might seem they would suffer due to payouts, sometimes insurance stocks stabilize or even rise if the impact is less severe than anticipated or if they have substantial reinsurance coverage. ShortTerm vs. LongTerm Gains The immediate aftermath sees the most significant stock movements. Investors often anticipate these trends and may invest accordingly before the hurricane makes landfall. Overall Economic Impact While certain sectors benefit, the overall economic impact of hurricanes can be negative due to disruptions in tourism, agriculture, and other industries vital to Floridas economy. Conclusion Stocks in home improvement, construction materials, equipment rentals, and related sectors have historically risen following major hurricanes in Florida. The increased demand for rebuilding and repair services drives this trend. Investors looking at historical data can observe these patterns and may consider them when making investment decisions posthurricane events."

Call it a style trend, Americans like brick but consider cinder block or concrete construction to look cheap. The thought that they are inherently weak is perpetrated by the extreme storms seen here but not of the type seen in Europe. It is true that a concrete and rebar house can survive a hurricane, but unless it is built to impractical standards it could still be flooded and loose its roof. You can rebuild on the walls, maybe, but the interior is still destroyed and it needs a complete roof replacement at the least. But there is no true guarantee that even that type of construction will survive either. I saw many destroyed in the aftermath of Katrina. 15 feet of water, it hit 30 ft in some areas, will take out much more than someone can comprehend without seeing it.

Consider this oped. Kasparov thinks the issue is a tendency to presume that everyone else shares your innate world view. The key here is western ideas of motive and rationality. Western culture is soaked in a capitalist ethos, underpinned by a widespread assumption that the profit motive rules supreme in terms of shaping political calculations, and that its the economy, stupid that drives decisionmaking in Russia and elsewhere. The collapse of the USSR reinforced this view, since it seemed that market principles and global business interests had triumphed. As a consequence, western leaders and business groups generally turned a blind eye when Putin gave speeches that clearly demonstrated his nationalist, expansionist agenda and then annexed Crimea. Worse, they failed to appreciate how isolated Putin had become. Instead, as Russian oligarchs became a fixture of global business, Putin was seen as an extrapolation of this group. The idea that he might be so hellbent on the destruction of democracy and the expansion of Russia that he would be willing to accept deep economic pain wasnt taken seriously. TBH, Xi is in exactly the same place. Theyve been remarkably consistent over the years about Taiwan and they have been taking actions to prepare themselves for conflict."

Since then they have been very aggressive with Bhutan, Philippines, Vietnam and Japan to name few potential flareups. Its doubtful that the CCP will greenlight Taiwan with an untested military. Especially in light of the lack of success Russia has had. The CCP has seen first hand how new Russian weapons fare against decommissioned and older NATO weapons platforms. Its not pretty. Undoubtedly the CCP has systems developed that the west hasnt seen. And those systems might provide an edge in a lightning attack and amphibious invasion but if the PLA and PLAN arent able to assert complete control across Taiwan their edge will be gone and they will get a taste of NATOs newest platforms. If the CCP can quickly control all of Taiwan the question of foreign intervention becomes murky. A stout defense of the Island would likewise buy the time the west needs to build a coalition and bring in the devil dogs. Taiwan is exactly the type of war Marines are made for. So clearly the CCP needs a nonpeer military to test themselves against. They dont need to invade the Philippines, Vietnam or Japan to fight a limited engagement over a few islands, so the west will yell but not strike. Bhutan has no military to speak of and no navy so the lessons there will be logistical. Assuming India doesnt want to scrap, the west will again be vocal but do nothing. India has not been a reliable partner to the west so it will need to handle a Chinese takeover in Bhutan on its own. I cant imagine the CCP going from zero experience to a full blown war in Taiwan with the west without any relevant, and recent, experience."

The reality is, the unemployment rate in China overall, not youth is around 5.3 and the European Unions is 6.4. The US unemployment rate is 4.4 but due to how this is calculated, the actual number is likely much higher wink wink labor force participation Regarding the deflation, I agree with you that extremes are bad, however, let me ask you something 1 When is the last time, prices of consumer goods have dropped in the US or the West in general? Let me give you an example, here in Spain, the government lowered the VAT value added tax 2 years ago, did the price of goods go down? Absolutely not, same price for everything. Now the government is reverting the policy so VAT increase, and what do the corporations do? They transfer the cost to the final consumer. 2 US corporations are having record profits and revenues, why are the wages not growing? Its simple, because corporations want to maximize the shareholders return and wages are considered as a cost in the balance sheet. Thats why the stock price is going through the roof while wages are stagnant. To be honest, we live in a very unequal world, where those who are rich mainly those who have assets like real state, stocks, alternative investment, you name it are getting richer and those who are poor people without assets are getting poorer because they dont have any way to fend off the inflationary tendencies."

This number does NOT reflect those in college our outside of the labor force. So OF THOSE youth looking for a job, 18 20 of them cant find one. Thats pretty bad for many reasons. 2 Why is it important? A Younger workers not those in school, but those looking for jobs tend to work more manual labor entry level jobs. Not only in restaurants clothing stores consumer goods areas....but also physically demanding jobs like construction for example. The jobs that these people work are typically unskilled. The fact that the production capital of the world is having trouble finding jobs for these people is terrible and can be viewed as a proxy for capital investment by Chinese companies. B Being unemployed in your 20s assuming you arent in school or building other skills can have DRASTIC impacts on the earnings of these people throughout their lives. Which reduces how much they have to spend. This all has knock on effects to consumers strength in the country. 3 When was the last time prices dropped in the US? Who cares?! That is a good thing! We want growth. We WANT controlled inflation. That means the system is working. No price increases means no growth and no o e is doing better than they were last year. 4 Wages in the US are ABSOLUTELY BOOMING!!! ESPECIALLY at the lower, unskilled area of the workforce.

Claiming we beat Germany is a myopic view of what actually happened.

Without Russia that war would have been far worse for the Allies. Any war with China over Taiwan will not include any boots on the ground on the mainland. No one wants it to go nuclear and that would be an actual red line. We will use air superiority and naval power to launch precision strikes but we will never invade. That would end life on the planet. We will have boots on the ground in Taiwan. The devil dogs will be there quickly. The Chinese have very sophisticated and layered A2AD. They will make it very hard on us. They will have victories on their path to defeat. The S China Sea is going to require us to knife fight in a floating phone booth. Its going to be brutal and bloody. Far worse than Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Leyte Gulf. In the case of Russia and China, no boots on the ground does not mean we wont send the Teams in. They live for that shit. Both would be conflicts that play into the individual strengths of DeltaSeals etc. You completely do not understand our ability to project power if you think we are only built for small to medium wars. We can project power globally for an extended amount of time. Plus our superpower is logistics. No one on the planet can compete with our abilities in that area. To give you some perspective, the US National Guard could defeat Russia in a conventional war. Ask yourself in a fight with just our guard, what good are Russian numbers when they run out bullets? Our military will deny them while suppling us. What target in Russia is out of reach of the Guards F22s? If we toss just the USN and some ballistic missiles into the mix and Russian imports will disappear as the seas will be blockaded. Their subs are their only useful tools in the oceans and we have the ability to hunt and kill them. It wont happen overnight, and they will get some kills but they wont be able resupply the few that survive once they are out of cruise missiles and torpedos.

Watch the video link I sent and educate yourself about the true cost in WW2. As for the reasons the missiles that you saw on tv were not intercepted has to do with recognizing that a weapons system cant intercept every missile. So missiles unlikely to strike designated targets or civilian centers are allowed to fall into the desert or industrial areas. That way the missiles that are tracking to areas that must be protected get extra redundancy or three during the intercept. The fact you dont know that illustrates how you are out of your depth.

Its not just have a conversation with a bot and ask random questions to see if you can fool it it involves asking a set of questions or performs actions along side a human and the judge has to decide which is which. When you say it has no relevance, I agree about its relevance is dated with new language models and actual artificial intelligence. But my original point was just how bad Siri is. You said chat gpt 4 cant pass the Turing test. Which its been proven to do. No matter what your view on the stupidity of the average person, it still passes. It prob wouldnt fool you, but thats not the parameters. It sounds like you think the Turing test needs to be able to be able fool every single person to pass, but thats not possible even for actual artificial intelligence. Someone would guess correctly in any sample size. Your tone is coming to me as if you are really taking this way more than just a friendly back and forth. Its okay to change your view when new evidence is presented or you entered into your view under false pretenses. Im just some random dude on the internet. Original point Siri sucks.

The replacement CEO was the founding CEO so if we take just assume that simple news, he should earn us some return and get the company back to its strategy that saw UIPaths stock trading around 18 22 a share. 2. The fear that this busts has already been priced in via the 47 sell off YTD so I think its oversold at this point. So I think even if theres a not a significant earnings beat, the guidance should push this baby atleast 3 to 5 back up to the levels at the time of guidance revisions and former CEO departure on May 29th. Which is why Im going to go all in Good luck"

What all of this means is that Nvidias current income levels are probably just for 5ish years and their revenue is going to peak soon. This completely does not justify a 5 or 10 T market cap.

That or you just read the grizzly report and believed it I dunno. Bad Product...1000lbs heavier than Joby Its true midnight is heavier, but Id need more information to understand why this would strictly rule out competition with Joby. The Midnight airframe is very specifically targeted at slightly shorter operational routes and urban air taxi service compared to Jobys design. Additional weight could be for stability, passenger features, or the use of cheaper OEM parts instead of custom design. They have not demonstrated full flight. the video here pretty conclusively demonstrates a full size Midnight airframe flying. I would like more information about, specifically, the Flight Data Im aware Joby published data about noise in conjunction with NASA, but Im not sure if thats specifically what youre referencing here? Additionally, USAF took delivery of a functional full size Midnight airframe I am assuming that they would not take on a full size vaporware. Founders are business leaders vs technocrats Gonna be honest here, my entire OP is about why this isnt a bad thing, more on this in the next point. using too many vendors and integrating them is a huge problem. This is how the entire aerospace industry works, not a huge problem. Archer is able to source from so many companies because those companies exist as suppliers to aerospace companies already. this article covers the divergent strategies between ACHR and JOBY in depth Of note But when it comes to their specific manufacturing strategies, the two companies have staked out sharply different paths Joby is vertically integrated and largely develops its components and systems inhouse, while Archer is pursuing a more traditional model by relying on a roster of Tier 1 legacy aerospace suppliers. The article goes on to quote Adam Goldstein specifically saying that they are aware that an IKEA aircraft as you call it is an 80 solution but provides a significantly superior market entry point. Uber Elevates engineer is even quoted as speculating that Joby will eventually divest from its full vertical integration. nbsp Again, this point and both ACHRs quotes and the note that no aerospace company comes close to the level of vertical integration Joby is pursuing is exactly what my post is about ACHRs path to revenue is WAY more clean than Jobys Stellantis investment is all shares I cover this in my OP. ACHR has far fewer outstanding shares than Joby even after considering a 400m issuance to Stellantis through 2030. Their plant is going to stay idle for a long time Why? Even if theyre not fully certified when the plant becomes operational, ramping up will take time and they have a global orderbook including shipping to international customers which may have different certification timelines or requirements. Keep issuing more ESOPs and founder has left Admittedly, I dont know how significant potential dilution from this is, but usually, ESOPs arent so massive as to completely shift the dynamic of investing outcomes. The founder left to start new companies after having a fallingout with the board, yes, but he hasnt ever publicly trashed the company or even corroborated claims of it being a PR Scam so maybe he just didnt like it and went to do something else."

I do think, if youre patient, simply buying the 2026 options will be wildly profitable. Per my thesis in this post, I do think Archer is currently undervalued by a significant margin. By October, ACHR should announce entry into and timeline for For Credit airframe type certification, and confirmed that their georgia plant remains on schedule. I admit October is aggressive, but I have seen significant hype spikes in the sector before. I may need to reload in October for more January 25... According to currently known timelines, we should know by January whether ACHR and JOBY will really start operations during 2025. Once they have confirmed type certification by EOY and rolled even one airframe off their main assembly line, there will be major investor FOMO. nbsp By EOY 2025, or whenever actual first revenue generating sales or flights take place, we will see ASTSlike price movements."

                    "text": "Yeah since you didnt read I guess you missed that part. Jobys market cap is about 3.7bn. Of that, almost 1bn is cashshort term assets. ACHRs cap is about 1.26bn, of which about 450m is cashshort term assets. This leaves about 2.7bn and .8bn in speculative, long term, and IP patent, tech value respectively. nbsp Joby has fully acquired i.e. owns the IP H2Fly Hydrogen powertrain, Xwing autonomous flight, and Uber Elevate ElevateOS for ride ordering. Moreover, Joby has customdesigned nearly their entire airframe. When combined with speculative valuation from successfully entering operations, this value seems fairly reasonable. Even in a bear case, Joby potentially has multiple outlets to offer itself for acquisition or pivot to another method e.g. conversion of existing planes to hydrogen and autonomous flight. nbsp Given the IP disparity Archer designs its own battery packs and some other components, along with the actual airframe of course, my thesis is that Jobys IP and slight schedule lead are now diminishing in relative value compared to Archers actual business plan. Jobys IP stack is cool, but certifying custom build, and operational scaling are going to be harder than for Archer... With certification and operations set to begin next year, Archers superior orderbook and market plans should be valued equivalently to Jobys IP lead at this time. nbsp TLDR Joby fair value for their IP stack and superior product ACHRs superior market entry plan and order book should be worth more now, as risk of complete failure diminishes and likelihood of going to market increases."

                    "text": "Yeah Ive seen this and the only substantive issue, especially in the year since this report was published, may be the facility monitoring, Ill get back to that piece in a bit. Overall, and ironic considering their claims of ACHR being misleading, I find the report to be pretty deliberately misleading itself. Top line, Archer has clearly built and flown at least several completely functional Midnight airframes since that report. Regarding the USAF contract Archer has since delivered a fully functional Midnight airframe to the Air Force. Its true that they are behind Joby, but thats always been the case, and I am assuming neither the FAA Special Airworthiness Cert nor the USAF would take delivery of a scam product or vaporware at least, not a full airframe. The USAF potential order for airframes is not a substantial piece of ACHRs overall order book or operating revenue plans in any case, but I dont see why they wouldnt be able to deliver on the relatively small order if USAF continues to pursue it. They mention ACHR contracts with USAF related to autonomous flight and other highertech initiatives. I do find it likely ACHR will not continue as a leader in that space, as Jobys technology in these areas is indeed superior, as I mention in my OP. These contracts are a fraction 30M or less of the main eVTOL initiative there in any case. Highlighting these as potential losses is misleading in the context of ACHRs main business. Grizzly consistently mentions the dollar value of exercised warrants and share awards in the context of the obviouslyinflated price of August 23. While yes, those shares may be worth a considerable amount if ACHR succeeds in going to market, Grizzly leads with very large numbers attached to those share issuances while barely mentioning how unusual a price above 7 is for ACHR. Also as I addressed in OP, Grizzly talks up Joby throughout, but Jobys total share dilution is over double ACHRs total outstanding shares to this day. While there may be valid complaints about dilution, its outrageous to be in up arms over the issuances when a key competitor has done so much more. They obliquely imply that the companies investing in ACHR are doing so because theyre being given an opportunity to sell out of the company at the inflated share price. Stellantis has since continued to agree to investments in the company, with direct sharesforwork programs to ramp manufacturing. This is a pretty clear rebuttal of a number of points made by Grizzly. nbsp Regarding the manufacturing, flight videos, and overall progress being clouded ACHR has ramped up PR and specific posting of facilities and progress on the Georgia plant. Midnight clearly exists and clearly flies, including a more recent 10 minute unedited flight test video, an exact rebuttal of one of Grizzlys issues Where they posted a similar uncut Joby video. Its also a little odd that Grizzly was complaining about editing to make a flight appear longer in a video that was already only 042 seconds, which... okay? The source who claimed 2028 was Optimistic for certification is clearly not tracking how overall sector is making progress. If thats the case, Joby would be on target for 2027 at best also, and they have a complete custom ecosystem to certify, not just offtheshelf parts. Both companies, in the year following, are maintaining target times and presenting percenttocompletion that still targets 2025. It is possible still that Archers certification will be delayed to late 25 or 2026... I do find it worrying that they are still a little handwavey about their completely compliant for credit airframes being ready to go or in testing. I have addressed schedule risks several times when posting about the sector and ACHR specifically. That said, since August 23, their main Georgia plant is clearly progressing and they maintain the EOY timeline for completion as of this quarter. nbsp The claims about doing on site observation of the airport are at least interesting. However, its notable that the week they spent observing was exactly when the full size Midnight was built but not yet FAA certified. This timeframe lines up with the archer engineer saying they would have to wait as I find it rather plausible flight tests were paused between completion of the Midnight full size prototype and its airworthiness certification note that the continue to test flight daily were from prior announcements that occurred before their observational period I also have very little faith in the reports of supposed eyewitnesses when they are being asked about things by a literally activist shortseller company... Maker and Midnight are both quiet and small airframes, unique looking, true, but also short range. A full test flight could occur over the space of an hour or less, so even daily test flights may be missed routinely by people simply on the same airport grounds. Note that Grizzly did not consult or reference FAA Air Traffic Control, flight plan logs, or other possible authoritative sources for air time. Moreover, the empty facility they visited is very definitely online given that actual photo and video from the manufacturing process has been posted, and, again, at least several operational midnight airframes exist including one that USAF deemed acceptable for delivery. nbsp TO BE CLEAR I am not saying ACHR is definitely a superstar company thats going to be shitting out eVTOLs into the air taxi market next year... I just dont think that the piece published by Grizzly is a reasonable analysis."

                    "text": "First of all, if youre holding shares, you should be fine over a longer time horizon, this is around where we should bottom out... why ACHR is valued how it is right now Archer and JOBY, and all other eVTOL companies except EHang in china, are prerevenue companies. In other words, theyre spending money on RD but havent yet begun operations. Archer isnt actually selling or flying airframes commercially yet. As a result, traditional valuations such as PE, Dividend return, DCF, and other methods are either difficult or impossible to apply as a valuation mechanic. financial information such as cash burn rate compare to likely start of revenue generation substitute for this as a risk indicator. It does have generally nonbinding commitments for airframe sales valued at 6bn, as well as plans to selfoperate an air taxi service. Along with projected growth in the new Advanced Air Mobility sector, archer is theoretically well positioned for massive growth when operations do begin... Conversely, two major risks remain to getting operations. Most notably, type certification from the FAA saying the aircraft can fly passengers, and scaling of manufacturing supply chain and completion of main assembly line. Theres also a wider risk of a lack of infrastructure to support Air Taxis or the sector simply not catching on as something the public pays for. Essentially, the value of the company is then Possible major growth as a first mover in a new industry minus risk of catastrophic failure. Investing long term is saying Im parking money here knowing im speculating on success while short selling is saying i think the risks here are too great, and this company will fail before reaching operations. Why, specifically, its current exact value? Well, per my post, i have no idea and think its undervalued, so i am invested, but other people clearly have assessed the risk profile differently. nbsp As to why its red or green on any given day... its generally red and low priced when no catalysts or news comes out... Archer is very much on the hook to be much more concrete about its schedule, and soon, or the perceived risks grow a lot... many people are probably getting scared off by the relative lack of news given the supposedly tight timeline to start production. it goes WAY green when catalysts hit... new deals, timelines being confirmed, advances in certification progress, etc... that is, when the likelihood of future revenues increase and risks decrease and investors pile in. nbsp EOY prediction... Given the above and the fact that i am heavily invested in Oct and Jan calls. whatll happen? Basically two possible routes 1. ACHR begins for credit FAA type certification flights and proceeds quickly due to having mostly off the shelf parts i cover this vs Jobys custom build in my OP, and completes its Georgia manufacturing plant. If both of these occur by EOY, we probably go back to near 52w high 7 if not higher. 2. Any delays, setbacks, or major negative news occurs, or radio silence continues, and price continues to tank as investors look for shorter term gains and are unwilling to keep money parked in ACHR while it struggles to get running. nbsp Past EOY 24 to EOY 25 If they succeed in an entry in service date by EOY 25, that is, commercial operations begin, then we get to see an ASTSlike move in the price, as retail and institutions surge in on the hype train. This may be dampened a bit if Joby enters service earlier especially if Joby begins operations and encounters problems with operations We may see pops much earlier in 25 if nonbinding order agreements become binding as a result of Certification. 6bn in confirmed order backlog would be MASSIVE compared to 6bn in uncommitted orders. Conversely, if for credit testing begins but they faildelay for some reason, price tanks back to 3 range. If manufacturing plant has delays or failures, or production stalls due to supply chain issues, commensurate reduction in share price. nbsp Overall if you have shares you have several strategies Very long hold, as the Bull case through 2030 implies explosive potential 10x or more in share price, more if we get meme price spikes Sell on hype taking profits next time really good news comes out... then either be happy with that or rebuy when price slips between good news announcements. nbsp why do i have shorter term options? Well i have shares too, the short term options I play are very much gambling... but, as i describe above, this very speculative tech sector can see impressively insane hype spikes. Great news about beginning for credit testing or new orders or firm commitments, all trigger runs past 5 to 67. The time between now and EOY 24 is absolutely critical for the stated timeline and therefore speculative options could pay out massively. If price spikes, i also take out Strangles add puts to the mix to account for bad news and price drops."

This is more about the comparative value of ACHR JOBY... I generally assume in this post that both companies will experience similar sector risks like slow FAA or supply chain to some extent. And i maintain that ACHRs potential revenue streams and overall risk profile justify a valuation similar to Jobys minus Jobys cash advantage value nbsp I suppose if you assume all revenue generation will be pushed to 2026 or later, ACHRs cash position is more concerning, but because total shares are so much lower, the dollar for dollar dilution of long run profits 2030 or even 2040 for shares if achr does another funding round is still unlikely to be a major factor... additionally, ACHR may be able to sell airframes overseas to committed customers who are able to certify in their own jurisdictions especially Saudi ArabiaUAE, and both companies are likely to be able to operate overseas nbsp Still, absolutely, this is a speculative industry... but look at ASTSRKLB for example, very similar trajectory and similar background of prerevenue speculative tech that finally went live. IF one of these companies shows continued progress on schedule, thats where you get your massive run up. If they dont, well, rip these options and i have another 56 reloads on LEAPs before even a major price increase cant save me P"

                    "text": "SpaceMobile is seen as the competitor to Elons Starlink. But investors are clamoring over ASTS claiming it has no rivals and dominates the space. No, it is targeting the D2C market, which Starlink and TMobile only began targeting AFTER they realized AST was indeed going to succeed in launching their test satellite. The timing and nature of the announcement were telling. So rather, Starlink is attempting to compete with AST. In the future, it is possible AST eats at Starlinks core market and viceversa, but thats down the road. So how many satellites does ASTS have in space? ZERO, with plans to launch their first sometime in the month of September. They have BW3. Which is a test satellite, I admit. But it did earn revenue from a gov contract. It is also the sane size as the current production satellites, but with 10x less processing bandwidth. It will assist in providing commercial services, though. But to say they have no satelllites is misleading because it implies we dont even know if their current model will work. It will. Starlinkl has over 5,000 satellites already in space that are fully operational and being used by consumers. Yes, for stationary wifi. Not cellular service. If youre thesis were true, Comcast wouldve bankrupted Verizon and ATT. But we all know that wasnt what happened. Even if you account for the D2C Starlink V2 minis, there are only around 100 with maybe 20 beams each? AST sats have 5600 each. They may only be launching 5 sats, but sat count ignores sat capabilities. ASTS will have a dilution fairly soon to raise further capital and will leave retail investors holding heavy bags. The stock skyrocketed specifically because they stated no more dilution in 2024 and probably none in 2025 as they target prepayments and ExIm financing. Currently it costs about 20m per sat, launch included. Prepayments from Voda, Verizon, and Att now average 4m, 20m, and 5m per sat respectively give or take conditional on successful launch, operation, and FCC approval, all of which are imminent. And that is only 3 of about 40 MNO partners contributing. Currently, if they did 5050 debtprepayment, each MNO would only have to prepay 400k per sat if they take 2 years to build with Opex at 120m per year. And why would MNO want to pay for the sats? Because thats a small price to pay for global coverage, no dead zones, reduced tower costs, improved service, emergency service for disasters, especially when you get half the ARPU. The list goes on. Sorry, but your estimation is ignorant of the reality of the situation. The price will vary a lot over the next two years, but at the end of the day, they now have a service that works, a product to launch, and 40 of the largest telecoms on Earth who want them to succeed, nevermind the US military. Edit just a note on my math 85 sats20msat120m opex32.060B40 mno85 sats2300ksat. I forgot how my napkin math earlier worked out to 400k, I had a reason, but didnt write it down."

This was something showing how much more directed angle of the danglebeam? AST sats will be vs Starlink being more wide and thus less throughput. There are a lot of factors into AST becoming quite profitable. I personally can see the stock hitting 100, although I was originally thinking 2030 onwards. I may think differently if this 30 price holds for a while. TLDR. There are highly technical data analysis of the tech AST sats use and directly compares the tech from Starlink. Search it up. Make your own informed decision on how off this post really is."

Starlinks core business is coverage to ground units, not existing cell phones. There is no overlap.

SpaceX just wants to get the FCC to weaken their rules for their direct to cell satellites, because their tech is shit and they arent able to get it done within the rules. ASTS has done it within the rules, FCC granted an Experimental License. And yes, you are betting on future income here with ASTS. When their satellites are up there, they have minimal costs for their WORLDWIDE service. Their profit margin is expected to be 90. They have MNOs with partners, that have 3 billion clients. So how much is it worth to have connection everywhere, on the sea, even in an airplane. Lets say only 200 million of the clients are willing to pay 5 usd a month, and ASTS gets 50, then thats 500 million revenue per month and with their profit margin lets say just 250 million profit PER MONTH. So lets say 3 billion profit a year and a PE Ratio of 20, thats 60 billion market cap or 250300 stock price. Ah, and we havent even talked aboud DoD contracts. ASTS already got a small DoD contract 900k, but its also just a test Satellite up there right now. Dilution wont be needed. If a MoU wants a commercial Agreement, they need to make prepayments like ATT did. Together with the revenue comming 2025 they have enough cash to get the next 2030 sattelites up there and then they will be cash flow positive."

This rise can be attributed to months of great news, huge derisking, MNO agreements, delivery of satellites and a launch schedulednfor early September. This valuation is basically going off the potential, not the present, valuation. Is it a bit high? Maybe. It might start settling after launch, once the dust has settled you could see a major pull back as people take profits, but nobody trades based off what a PRE REVENUE COMPANY is worth today, its the potential. That being said, this is very uninformed DD. Starlink is a competitor, but to say they have 5000 satellites, as if they are all capable of D2D, is misleading. They are in a stalemate and unless they convince the FCC to lax their permitted interference levels, they wont be launching their service anytime soon. This can go either way and we will have to see what the verdict is. ASTS will be worth 100share in 2 years, probably sooner. Assuming no disasters with launch and unfurling."

The whole point of ASTS is that it has a patented technology for the signal to reach mobile phones without any additional equipment other than your phone as a receiver. Starlink needs additional receiver that is klunky and ugly AF. Also, the business model of ASTS is smart, they will be offering their service through already established carriers, so they dont need to build up the distribution of their product. People will just have an additional option on their already existing mobile phone bill if they want to pay extra for global coverage and that will go to ASTS. Also, you cannot value a prerevenue company on a balance sheet data, are you dumb? That being said. Dilution is very likely if not certain. The durability of satelites is questionable, given just their sheer size largest sats ever put up to enable the transmission and especially signal receiving from earth, if there is any issue with space debree and one of the initial 5 is down, it could mean disaster. Global coverage is VERY VERY far away. And lastly are we sure EVERYONE is going to want to pay more for this fabled global coverage? Like, a grandma in maine is going to pay extra for this service? How many places are actually not covered by the existing 4g network already? Not that many actually. So ASTS is being priced as if the global adoption is a given, when in reality it could be that only adventurers and outdoors people will use the service. That is not a very huge market that would justify putting up 60 satelites in space to service their needs unless the subscription is priced hundreds of dollars per month which means even fewer people using it, meaning their revenues will likely be way lower than what we think today, and profitability might not ever be achieved. So yeah, id value this as a 1.21.6 billion market cap company atm. Definitely not 10b where its going currently."

The big carriers just spent 81 billion dollars on auctions for the 5G spectrum. You think uncle Sam will just let Starlink illegitimize that. That is a shit ton of income the US government will protect. ASTS works with carriers using this spectrum. Many also mentioned that telecom is a debt burdened business. But that is mostly because of these spectrum licenses and expenses infrastructure, ASTS wont have these costs. 2. There will be no dilution. There is additionally outstanding warrants that ASTS can redeem. 3. The market cap is only like 9billion. And ofc it doesnt make a lot of money its prerevenue. But it will start making some real money this year still. The margins on the sat revenue is 90. Just ask your daddy Elon about how Tesla did it for a decade."

I think the other thing to keep in mind is that a large chunk of their sat costs are supposedly launch costs. Looking at 1500 kgsat and about 3800kg for F9, you get about half of the cost being launch costs. WhenIf Starship comes that will cut margins almost in half. Which is nuts. Also, they do cost 20m per sat, but if only 10m to build, they can build a lot more with their current cash than everyone thinks. Im pretty sure they have 280x raised using ATM in July so maybe 30m?50m debt120m warrants480m. They COULD build 480m120m annual opex120m runway cushion10msat24 sats next year if they can get to 2mo cadence. Then they only need 15 more sats for continuous coverage in Norther ln hemisphere. Just building them gives leverage to partners for financing launch costs. Its much better to go to partnersdebt markets with hey we have 25 of these money printers on the ground, but they belong in space than hey we need halp to build them. Especially if BBB2 works as intendedproves market. And that brings me to the most important part. The MAIN issue this company had was executing production. Sure, they cost 115m for 5 sats, but it took two years, so thats 240m opex. It shouldve been 120m. They had issues with supply chain and also did a surprise rework of their antennae elements. That is how we wound up in the 2s. But thats likely, with a high degree of certainty, behind us. They still have more to prove with manufacturing, but their current targets are 17 for 2025. I think we will see 25 launched by 2026 end given current pacing. That sounds pessimistic, but it scales with their cadence record, AND having intermittent coverage 50 of the time whereas before you had it 0 is actually huge to the point a lot of customers may not notice that much, especially if the service keeps getting better over time."

People originally thought that they couldnt sell intermittent service so bearish throughout, but that turns out to have been a mistake because A They could never have launched 20 sats at once anyways, even if they had all the money on hand and B Why wait to use the service until its continuous if it is frictionless and users dont even know they are on NTN? From a user perspectve, it will just seem like they have better service and coverage every launch until one day they are never outside of a service area. They will be beta testing this Fallwinter it seems and I think early subscriptionsrudimentary plans in 2025 will be sold. But yes, you are not wrong to question that.

I went to Europe a while back, paid 10 bucks a day for cell phone use because of roaming charges. Youre doing the equivalent of saying oh damn, they can depend on 3,650 dollars a year from that guy! here. They got 20 bucks out of me, total, in the month I was there. Then I bought a burner phone. 1080 millions is the theoretical maximum at a dollar a month, sure, but mostly were talking about a guy who has to do a job out in the country once in a blue moon and cant depend on wifi.

For people in areas we dont already have cellular service on the regular. For instance, me, and every single person I interact with, has 0 benefit from this service. There ARE people who require it. But immediately assuming right from the get go theyre going to immediately get as many subscribers as ALL of Verizon does? Verizon has 144million subscribers AND IS THE LARGEST of all.... A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE?! Whats your aggressive estimate because Brother the entire USA only has 300million mobile users, what you think every single person is going to drop high speed video and switch to asts provided services? Which again, this is untested and may not ever happen, but if ALL satellite bands are being utilized by different subscribers, the max bandwidth per person is somewhere along the lines of like 250kbsecond if the system is fully utilized. Luckily 99 of the time not everyone will be using it, but still. No way in hell that many people will switch when theyre already ecosystem locked."

Potential for huge cost savings while keeping 6,500 profitable stores in place with remaining stores likely to be more profitable without competition from Walgreens 2 in same community.

Maybe the regional banks again, maybe consumer credit delinquencies, maybe something else. Not sure the real downturn as opposed to whatever the last two weeks have been lasts that long since the Fed has so much ammo, and maybe some of the IRACHIPS investments pay off in the jobs data. And small cap investment has been so suppressed from the inflationfighting. But it does feel like real softening is kicking in, and a couple 25bp cuts wont make much of a dent. Given Goolsbees commemts I dont expect much more than that. Maybe one 50bp cut if were lucky. But it really feels like the Fed rate needs to get back into the 3 range to extend the growth. Who knows though. Maybe we get that, and the consumers actually overleverage out their asses. And we get another lovely credit bubble crash in a few years !imgemotet5_2th5231225"

However, the reason it feels like a shitty economy is because for the every day individual, not companies, this growth isnt trickling down in any way. Not only is wage growth stagnent, but there are less jobs, and the excess cash generated by these companies is sitting in treasuries and cash on balance sheet. There used to be a more tightly coupled relationship between GDP growth and wage growth, that relationship has been broken due to the fact that companies over the past decade have significantly increased efficiency and productivity."

My betting is if it gets real bad before the election, no printing. But if it gets bad afterwards, and we have you know who in, then printing will happen because Powell et.al. prefer being alive and not the target of politically motivated assassinations cos now, that would be legal and all, crazy days"

Though I was honestly thinking in a longer time frame than the last six months, which I think is obvious from my comments. I was talking about inventory levels and CHIPSIRA spend winding down which matches the subindicators to the ISM PMI survey the actual report is here as opposed to just the headline and the details often matter more, imo. Inventories and order backlogs are quite low, as is employment, but delivery lags are rising, indicating orders outpacing production. Exports are stable, despite how strong the dollar has been, which bodes well for additional exports as the dollar comes off a bit vs. Euro, Yen, etc. On top of that, you have to go back a bit and look at the baselines from COVID and the WFH pressure wage inflation is sticky its harder to push back down than commodity inflation even moreso now with Chinas economy being so weak and unattractive for offshoring. Consumer spending has been quite resilient largely because of that, while inflation in other sectors excluding housing, which is an interest rates zoning laws story have come back down. All of that still points to a gardenvariety correction, sector rebalancing, and soft landing. But, as I said, the softness does depend on how aggressively the Fed cuts."

So, a PATH investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects PATH the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for PATH. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

They have since beat all last quarter&#39;s targets and increased full year targets, so all things being equal, it should be up a little (unless the market mis-priced last time around).  Then again that is predicated on markets acting rationally and the confidence in macroeconomic environment being static.Part of the problem is the high stock based compensation, though that has been the case since Path went public, couple that with slowing growth rate is problematic.  I believe the other larger issue is Cathy&#39;s ownership.  Other fund managers don&#39;t like or respect her and based on the performance of her other picks, I think they are waiting her out and hoping for redemptions to force additional liquidation further putting downward pressure on the stock... just how I&#39;m seeing the bigger picture here of late."

AI is still ealry so I think with time as AI gets smarter it will use more rationality in its decisions which should help markets become more like it was in past"

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like PATH to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax PATH would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of PATH stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on PATH stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on PATH stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."

Disappointing - their sales strategy and revenue numbers seem much better than sp performance, and the leadership change was saved by the Founder.  Will watch to see if $10 looks like a floor. In the meantime, I&#39;m seeing another New Process investment, SXOOF (St George&#39;s) appear to be at its floor - cold metallurgy, non polluting, incredibly efficient recycling of Alkaline and soon Lithium batteries - just commissioned first plant in Quebec, and at less than a nickel a share, appears to have a brighter short-term possibility than PATH."
