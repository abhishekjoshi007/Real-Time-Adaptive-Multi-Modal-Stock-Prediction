Effective backlog in July was about $20.8 million which included the $12.8 million order which was supposed to ship in the next three months when announced and based on the math they gave in the report there is still another 700k which appears to be unannounced backlog in effective backlog which would make total of that portion at $13.5 million. So assuming they shipped half of that, 6.75M, and most of the $7.3 million that was on the books June 1st. Let’s just say 6M. So 6.75 plus 6.0 plus 1 million of Incal is about $13.75 million which should beat estimates and make sure earnings greater than 1 cent. Now the problem is that this quarter which begin September 1st, the estimates are $16.5 million for revenues. If my estimates are close for the past quarter, Aehr will still have $8 million revenues in backlog just to start this quarter ending November 30th with most all of it likely shipping this quarter.

Yahoo,2024-08-06,"Infineon&#39;s Q3 FY24 earnings call transcript came out today.  Opening remarks acknowledged healthy consumer demand in China, but tepid Western markets. They confirmed a SiC revenue target of 600 million euros this fiscal year, up 20% from last year, but then the CEO seemed to walk that back a bit in Q&amp;A.  Kulim 3 (200 mm SiC fab/module) will &#34;open&#34; this week and slowly ramp as determined by customer demand.  There was an interesting question asked about VW (referring to ON&#39;s recent PR announcing Onsemi as the primary supplier for VW&#39;s SCC Platform).  SiC device prices are dropping - which is normal for improving economics as the shift to 200mm wafers takes place.  Infineon now is offering &#34;fusion&#34; modules that combine silicon and SiC power devices and already has collected two design wins.

Yahoo,2024-08-05,"For decades, silicon has been the main material of electronics, but in the continuous path towards miniaturization it seems destined to be abandoned soon due to some of its intrinsic limitations. To be able to control a series of physical phenomena useful in some new sectors, such as photonics, it would be necessary to be able to model the inside of thin sheets of silicon at nanometric dimensions. An objective that has so far been impossible, so much so that it has prompted the search for possible substitutes for silicon. However, even the possible candidate materials present various obstacles. The new technique, which uses very short laser pulses, allows us to engrave thin layers (silicon wafers) with great precision, reaching dimensions 10 times smaller than what has been possible so far, reaching 100 nanometres. The technique which, the researchers observe , can be applied on relatively large surfaces and in a very efficient way. It could therefore pave the way for new applications of silicon and the most interesting ones, according to Tokel “could concern photonics, in particular metamaterials and photonic crystals”.",Negative,-1,0.8159775137901306,Main
