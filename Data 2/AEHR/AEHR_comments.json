That&#39;s the wrong direction.  I really don&#39;t see this stock doing anything but settling back to 12 until they announce a great thing that will move the forward PE in the right direction.  What am I missing. I want a reason to buy this again, but I can&#39;t find any, other than a short squeeze, which, without fundamentals, is just a Gamestop play that can cut your fingers by holding.  A few insiders buying at a discount of 10.50 doesn&#39;t tempt me.  Especially with other chip sector stocks, or even holding an ETF like Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund (VGT) for the last 6 months you&#39;d be so much wealthier.

It would have been nice to see effective backlog because I would like to see the value of the Sonoma systems."

As NVDA and the gang became a better investment throughout the day, suddenly AEHR got dumped. \n\nAEHR can grow with orders and still underperform for years.

That many shares in a low volume day would have dropped it lower. It had good demand at those levels. Maybe a fund was liquidating a position and used overall market strength to unload a position. Should be in a quiet period for insider sales. I am not a believer in todays market rally. This is just hype coming out of the Communicopia conference toward NVIDIA in my opinion.

Yes, in the sense that in the last call management acknowledged the current FY25 rev forecast of $70M includes $12M (plus/minus) from INCAL.  No, in the sense that they also stated they see a lot of potential upside, the recent first order for 6 Sonoma systems refers to immense potential to grow that business significantly.  Keep in mind AEHR got beat up a lot in the last 9 months due to dropping its FY24 rev forecast twice.  They need to rebuild their credibility.  They are currently getting no benefit of the doubt and I think its CEO/CFO learned a lot over that period and are no longer over-promising on the numbers."

Is it possible that this is the Silicon Photonics work that Aehr received orders from back on March 1, 2024?  The article was in techradar."

Effective backlog in July was about $20.8 million which included the $12.8 million order which was supposed to ship in the next three months when announced and based on the math they gave in the report there is still another 700k which appears to be unannounced backlog in effective backlog which would make total of that portion at $13.5 million. So assuming they shipped half of that, 6.75M, and most of the $7.3 million that was on the books June 1st. Let’s just say 6M. So 6.75 plus 6.0 plus 1 million of Incal is about $13.75 million which should beat estimates and make sure earnings greater than 1 cent. Now the problem is that this quarter which begin September 1st, the estimates are $16.5 million for revenues. If my estimates are close for the past quarter, Aehr will still have $8 million revenues in backlog just to start this quarter ending November 30th with most all of it likely shipping this quarter. Now we just need to build on this and get some Orders to make that $16.5 and get some spring into the next quarter."

Sure, that will happen in the future. When, it’s hard to say.  I think it’s far more likely that AI accelerator burn-in and memory (hard drive and flash) combined with SiC device burn in will push total revenue to $100m or higher in FY26.  And flash memory revenue will exceed SiC revenue in the next few years.  That assumes no hiccups in their flash memory test program.  AI is going to drive a big increase in demand for enterprise storage."

He stated AEHR has been in discussions with multiple flash memory companies for multiple years, and those companies provided feedback in terms of defining desirable features and capabilities.  So that alone tells you yes, a good part of the work to date and the ongoing work should transfer over to other NAND/flash customers, aside from the one customer who agreed to the year-long benchmarking program in FY25.  Nevertheless, I expect that benchmark testing and development of certain additional hardware/software features may be needed before getting future orders from other NAND/flash customers.   We&#39;ll have to wait and see how this unfolds.   It sounds like they are devoting most of their R&amp;D budget in FY25 toward this particular NAND/Flash customer opportunity/benchmark."

I guess one more question: any sense if this large effort is primarily for wafer packs or for the Fox system configuration? thx"

Lately, it appears there is strong support at around 10 bucks.  I really like the story and the management.  I believe you&#39;ll get serious volatility until good news comes out on a more frequent basis.  Good news equals good moves.

Kulim 3 (200 mm SiC fab/module) will &#34;open&#34; this week and slowly ramp as determined by customer demand.  There was an interesting question asked about VW (referring to ON&#39;s recent PR announcing Onsemi as the primary supplier for VW&#39;s SCC Platform).  SiC device prices are dropping - which is normal for improving economics as the shift to 200mm wafers takes place.  Infineon now is offering &#34;fusion&#34; modules that combine silicon and SiC power devices and already has collected two design wins. It&#39;s hard to predict what this means for AEHR sales to IFNNY in AEHR&#39;s FY25.  Maybe one more XP with fully integrated and automated aligner.  And a bunch of Waferpaks."

To be able to control a series of physical phenomena useful in some new sectors, such as photonics, it would be necessary to be able to model the inside of thin sheets of silicon at nanometric dimensions. An objective that has so far been impossible, so much so that it has prompted the search for possible substitutes for silicon. However, even the possible candidate materials present various obstacles. The new technique, which uses very short laser pulses, allows us to engrave thin layers (silicon wafers) with great precision, reaching dimensions 10 times smaller than what has been possible so far, reaching 100 nanometres. The technique which, the researchers observe , can be applied on relatively large surfaces and in a very efficient way. It could therefore pave the way for new applications of silicon and the most interesting ones, according to Tokel “could concern photonics, in particular metamaterials and photonic crystals”."
