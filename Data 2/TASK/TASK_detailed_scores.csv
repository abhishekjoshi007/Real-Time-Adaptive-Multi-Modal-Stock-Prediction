Reddit,2024-10-13,"Tell me you dont know anything about economics without telling me you dont know anything about economics. Deflation is bad for the economy because it discourages spending, investment, and consumption at the macro level. Sure, deflation would benefit inelastic essentials like food, but in a service based economy that relies heavily on capital investment and consumption, 8 deflation over several years would have disastrous effects. Deflation increases the purchasing power per dollar, which on the surface sounds good until you realize it also means wages will go down. It also discourages investment at all levels since rampant deflation would create a sentiment that its better to hold off since you can get more for your money later on. Why take the risk investing in the market or investing in RD if you could earn 8 just having the money sit in a bank account. High deflation would also decimate people with mortgages or loans since the payments on the loan remain the same while the purchasing power per dollar and their wages would be going down. So their monthly mortgage payments would be going up over time in real terms. High inflation is also bad, but a small amount of inflation like 2 benefits everyone because it means spending and investment is encouraged since money is losing 2 of its value if its doing nothing, and payments on mortgages and loans go down in real terms over long periods.

Take all of that money away and its 190year for each employee truly a nonfactor. The engineers union is also dumb as fuck. They think if the IAM union gets more, they can also get more next year. The money bucket is only so big, giving one group a big slice means theres less for others. In the end, they all suffer hoping for a 40 Pension dream in the sky.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"What I said was Software is a different level of complexity due to being public facing. I used security to illustrate that point. Software grows in complexity like many engineering systems nonlinearly as lines of code increase and various projects connect, which they frequently have to, for software to function. Why does this make it harder? Mainly due to the fact that you cannot easily separate software systems like you might separate mechanical systems like HVAC from landing gear. There are more parts to software call them libraries, function, methods, projects or whatever you want and they have to interconnect and communicate to the tune of millions of lines of code supported by thousands of programmers all over the place.

This is the problem with public facing. Never mind the infinite number of attack vectors just for being online exposing any vulnerability to the millions of lines of code running on all these devices... Last, planes are not public facing.

You dont have to design a plane in such a way that someone cant steal the air bags... that isnt a realistic worry.

Reddit,2024-10-10,"I feel the opposite. Im not sure why anyone would be buying in at todays prices. Youve already missed the boat, expectations are so sky high for NVIDIA that its virtually impossible for NVIDIA to meet them, let alone continue to exceed them. Plus NVIDIA has historically been a VERY cyclical stock, and in a very cyclical industry. So its no doubt going to eventually enter a cyclical downturn, and when that happens the fall is going to be absolutely brutal to people buying anywhere close to the top who didnt sell. To be clear, I dont know exactly when NVDA will start to fall a bunch from the cyclical downturn, but I know that itll definitely happen. Even if it doesnt happen for say 2 to 3 more years, I dont think that risks vs reward are worth getting in now at todays valuation.",Negative,-1,0.9995492100715637,Reply

The power puck, the glasses and the wristband thing. Its not just glasses. Its 3 things. The glasses are too thick for prime time.

Thats before we even begin to talk about the liability of something impeding vision while driving. Having played significantly with OCR Optical character recognition trying to apply it for a project at work, I have no faith at all it could translate the text on random signs into another language. It likely wont even get the original language right. The AR art displays is an interesting idea though. I could also see it being used as an enhancement for Pokemon GO style games. The other thing you have to think about is that a lot of this processing would need to be done locally by the glasses.

Reddit,2024-09-14,"I challenge your ChatGpT bear post with my bull case gpt post. We can do this all day. The bull case for NVIDIA, despite the potential cracks in the AI scaling hypothesis, remains compelling due to a number of factors 1. AI Beyond Scaling Diversification of Architectures While the scaling hypothesis may face limitations, NVIDIA is not solely reliant on larger models for growth. The shift towards diverse architecturessuch as edge computing, federated learning, and more efficient, adaptable modelsstill heavily depends on advanced hardware. NVIDIAs innovation in custom AI chips and specialized GPUs for varied workloads ensures that it continues to dominate, even as the industry pivots away from pure scale. 2. AI Software Ecosystem NVIDIAs CUDA platform, AI software stack, and Deep Learning SDKs offer essential tools for AI developers. These tools are deeply integrated across the AI research and enterprise ecosystems, which means that even if scaling slows, NVIDIAs software dominance secures its position as a key player. Moreover, AI companies are dependent on NVIDIAs endtoend platform, from training to deployment, and this dependency is unlikely to change even if the emphasis shifts from scale to smarter, more efficient architectures. 3. Enterprise and Data Center Expansion Even beyond researchdriven AI, enterprise adoption of AI is growing rapidly. Companies across industriesfinance, healthcare, and logisticsare integrating AI into their operations, and this trend fuels continued demand for highperformance computing HPC solutions. NVIDIAs foothold in data centers is a major asset, as demand for AIpowered insights and automation continues to grow. The company is positioned to benefit from AIdriven automation, which is expected to scale massively in the next few years. 4. AI in Autonomous Systems NVIDIAs leadership in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other AIdriven automation solutions offers another strong growth avenue. The companys Drive platform for autonomous driving and its investments in industrial robots and AIpowered edge devices place NVIDIA in a favorable position as automation accelerates across multiple industries. 5. Gaming and Virtual Worlds Metaverse While AI remains the main growth driver, NVIDIAs core business in gaming is still robust, and its investment in the metaverseparticularly via its Omniverse platformis positioned for future growth. The convergence of AI, VR, and GPUpowered graphics in virtual worlds will open up new revenue streams, ensuring that NVIDIAs hardware remains in demand across various sectors beyond traditional AI use cases. 6. AI Custom Silicon and Competition NVIDIA is investing heavily in custom silicon AIspecific hardware. The Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchip, alongside nextgen H100 GPUs, cater to evolving needs in AI and HPC. These chips optimize AI workloads and enable costeffective scaling, keeping NVIDIA ahead of competitors like AMD and Intel. 7. AI as a Deflationary Force The massive potential of AI to create efficiencies across industries means that the macroeconomic environment will continue to favor companies like NVIDIA. As AI proves its worth in reducing operational costs, improving supply chains, and automating workflows, NVIDIAs role in supplying the necessary infrastructure will keep demand strong. Conclusion Bull Case for NVDA Despite possible challenges to the scalability hypothesis, NVIDIA remains a key enabler of the AI economy. Its leadership in hardware and software, expansion into new markets like autonomous vehicles, and diverse revenue streams provide a strong foundation for continued growth. Even if the AI bubble bursts in some areas, the underlying technological advancements and enterprise applications are likely to sustain NVIDIAs trajectory.",Positive,2,0.9999943375587463,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-15,"I dont like Starbucks, never really have. But its an interesting thought exercise If you were given 85 million signing bonus plus an even sicker compensation package, what changes would you make to prove you were worth it? Myself, my forte is in making services and products undeniably great, and letting quality drive the business side. Not to the exclusion of shrewd business strategy and tactics, but I just put the priority on having something great that people want, and letting that be the flywheel. So for me, Id finally accept the incredibly common perception that Starbucks actual coffee is mediorceburnt. Weve seen others publicly and with humility accept and fix that... see McCafe, DPZ, CMG, etc. For those who say you cant make that change! I say you cant expect big changes unless you make changes. For those who say the old is good enough, I point to the stock performance as proof its not. Id be the best quality and go with a nicer but more broadly appealing taste profile. As SBUX, wed have the scale and resources to get the very best while still benefitting from scale. Im not sweating about margins in the first wave of this transformation because frankly a drink that you can charge a food price for suggests margin not be a problem over time. Second Id embrace some tech. People are kind of over the myth that you need a slow paced barista teasing out your drink for five minutes. CafeLux and Nespresso have shown you can get 90 of great coffee or cold drinks without lifting a finger. Id seek to take the best of learnings from those and apply them to a faster service model. Maybe that means the barista role is to focus on the part only they can do, and do best, but spares them from the other 90. Thats still TBD, but the goal of pumping out the actual drinks, cold or hot, WAY faster is not negotiable. In parallel wed have some kind of highly mediamentionable value choices. Perhaps not the 99 cent coffee that every pundit thinks they were the first to think of, since it would only be reinforcing the oldbad taste and also trading short term traffic surge which isnt the problem for weaker reputation and perception. But maybe some quick and easy 3 buck options that are enough to generate broad public knowledge. The taste and speed have to be newsworthy upgrades. The value options must also generate a buzz, but should be aligned with supporting not undermining the first two priorities. There would be more phases, but the emergency mission would be whole new supply and taste, combined with huge efficiency boost by automating that which can be. That phase alone probably justifies yesterdays 20 billion move.",Positive,2,0.7761634588241577,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-15,"I understand Nicol did great work at Chipotle, thats fine. I just dont understand why they dont spend time and resources searching for someone who thinks they can do it and has a plan. To me, it seems lazy and disgusting. This guy better do a real good job with how much they are handing over. Do you know what I mean? Its a big job sure but this mentality of thinking just this guy can do the job looks stupid to me. Maybe Im wrong, I guess the important thing to them is that they spend the money on the guy they think has the best odds of accomplishing their goals. And id take the money too, but its hard to not feel negative about one man getting all this money but I do suppose he has a big job ahead that will likely be stressful. But doesnt everyone feel that way about their jobs....ok Ill stop. Lol. And I read a comment, they have taken out seating. Yeah Im sure you need to get paid a few million for being that issue to light lol. I hardly ever go there because Im not into spending my money on that, dont go to Dunkin either. But the one thing I can recall about Starbucks is how the food in display looks like fake cardboard or something and isnt appetizing looking at all. I felt like asking if food is real. I think I tried it once bc I wanted to know if it was real lol, it was good I believe but I was definitely hungry after still.

Teslas misleading marketing, he said, has had the dangerous effect of providing overconfidence and building you up to thinking its safer than it actually is.

Because there are often measurable differences in companies decisions and the value therein between CEOs when the rest of the company makeup remains largely the same. The easiest examples of this would be Jamie Dimon and Steve Jobs, both of whom pretty easily can be shown to have had billions of dollars of impact on shareholders vs. their peers. Major differences in performance of companies is indicative of deeper issues throughout the company, not of the decisions of a single person How do you think those issues get resolved?

I also think youd find plenty of leaders within these companies who are more than capable of doing the job without needing 20M bonuses Im sure I can find someone to do your job for less than you currently do it for, however much that is. What someone needs isnt relevant. What someones value is, as determined by the rarity of their skillset, is. If the company viewed the other leaders within the company as equally competent to lead the company as the CEO, but cheaper, they wouldve simply hired those leaders instead.

Every great institution in our country has been turned toward that purpose. Our education system is underfunded, understaffed, and underappreciated. Our health system is predatory to the extreme and only accessible to the wealthiest among us. Our police force is murderously violent, and protects corporate interests above the citizenry. Our financial systems have been completely overrun by billionaire fraudsters and now operate on boom and bust cycles that pilfer public funds. Our food production has been brutally industrialized and our food itself has been stuffed with toxic additives and overprocessed to squeeze out every last cent of profit. Unions and workers rights have been demonized and systematically deconstructed. Worker pay has been under gradual decline for half a century, while housing has become yet another investment vehicle causing costs to skyrocket. Our politicians, fully and openly bought by the oligarchs, obstruct any attempt at change while engaging in public hedonism. And all the while, we are drowning in unending propaganda pushing American exceptionalism, praising rugged individualism, and demonizing kindness, generosity, and collectiveness. So, yeah.

Reddit,2024-08-13,"The Play Store competes with FDroid and direct APK distribution. The main reason the Play Store is so popular is because direct APK distribution is perceived as insecure since anyone can put any program as an APK, and FDroid only allows opensource software released under permissive or copyleft licenses such as the GNU GPL or the Apache license and many developers dont want to make their apps opensource, plus developing and maintaining an app store is hard work which is why other companies havent bothered competing except Huawei, but the US government banned Huawei from selling their phones in the USA they ban the competition and then complain about monopolies smh.

Reddit,2024-08-13,"Chrome does do things with your data that other browsers dont do. Just as with Gmail, Chrome collects your user ID and device ID in too many categories. Unlike Safari, Edge and Firefox, Chrome says it links all harvested data to devices and individuals. Safari collects but doesnt link browsing history, usage data and locations to users. Neither Firefox nor Edge link usage data. But Chrome says it collects all those data fields and links all of them to user identities. This isnt complicated. The fact is that Chrome collects more data than any of the other browsers, yet is the only one that doesnt appear to collect any data that isnt linked to user identities. This is a much more shocking illustration of the different philosophies at play. Chrome hasnt even attempted to protect its users privacy in this way. This isnt about specific data fields, this is about an overarching attitude to privacy. It is technically true Chrome does not directly make revenue for Google because it is free to use. But this is a bit disingenuous as an assertion because Google sells access to data collected by Chrome to advertisers, who use it to target you with ads all across the internet. This leads to undisclosed fucktons of revenue. The biggest change is Ad Topics, a.k.a. the Topics API if youre a huge nerd whos been following this stuff for years. With Topics, Chrome will keep track of all the websites youre looking at and sort you into a variety of categories. This tracking happens in your browser and the data stays on your device. Neither Google nor anyone else gets to see your browsing history or learn anything about you as an individual throughout this process. Websites and advertising companies will know theres a person interested in a certain Topic, but they wont be able to tell who you are specifically. Edit formatting",Neutral,0,0.9999477863311768,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-09,"So the numbers tell a clear story, right? Usage growth has died down to zero. As seen in gross services volume and active users. And with the guidance of 6 revenue for Q3, it stands to be expected that usage will start shrinking now. Despite over a hundred million Dollars spent on sales and marketing per year. My interpretation UpWorks service is good at the beginning of the user journey. To match buyers and sellers. But then it becomes a chore. Because of the weekly invoice cycle and the separate invoicing from sellers and UpWork. That makes it an 8x worse solution than direct seller to buyer invoices. UpWork gained a massive amount of users during covid. And now those users abandon the service. Its a long way down to precovid levels. It can make the business decline for years. On the upside, UpWork might have the potential to become as big as the other market place leaders. Amazon, Uber, Booking, AirBnB, Shopify etc are all orders of magnitude larger than UpWork and I dont see a reason the leading work market place shouldnt become as big as those. But I think that would require a shift in the way UpWork is run. As the current approach to growth is not working. As can be seen in the numbers.",Positive,1,0.7604379057884216,Reply

So, the larger the contract, the lower the fee UpWork takes. The new structure is a flat 10 fee for all. I do think some contracts were taken outside of UpWork, which led to a reduction in the average spend per client which is reflected in the Gross service volume decline.

Still, the 6 active clients YoY look kinda good, so if those would be the only numbers we have QoQ and YoY, I would say I dont know what to think. Lets wait until next quarter. But we also have the guidance of 6 in revenue QoQ. The worst guidance in the history of UpWork. And they explain it with negative trends in the topoffunnel which could mean active clients or spent per client I think and expect it to continue We did see those trends get slightly worse in June and July And they talk about working on anticircumvention efforts in the call. You can find it in the transcript. Which should mean they will try to stop buyers and sellers from leaving the platform once they have found each other.

If you move it to a Roth, then its already taxed and she or her heirs can pull it taxfree. AND its not subject to RMDs. It might be reasonable to just do a Roth conversion for the CB money or several over a couple years depending on where she is in the tax and IRMAA brackets.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"She has to take out a few thousand every year bc shes over a certain age. Youre describing RMD required minimum distribution, from a retirement account? Yes, the government requires this and provides the table for how much to take, based on the FMV of the accounts at prior year end and the persons age, which I dont see where you told us this important piece of information. but I also dont want her to have to pay 20 tax on the money right away. Anything that is removed from a taxable retirement account, such as Trad IRA or 401k, is taxable as ordinary income. It may or may not be 20. There is withholding, which is deducted at the time of the distribution, for retirement accounts. Thats likely the 20 you mention, which is not Taxes. Its a prepayment against her 1040. a big chunk in a vanguard 20 and then I invested the other 19. Vanguard is a brokerage. Which funds? Invested the other 19 in what? A perspective of the mix helps. Shes a single, widow, head of household thats old enough to hit any qualifier for tax stuff. Shes retired. The 5y rule wouldnt apply to her, I know that. Yes, there are a number of 5year rules for Roth. Yes, the accountbased Roth IRA fiveyear rule says you cannot withdraw earnings taxfree until its been at least five years since you first contributed to a Roth IRA account. This fiveyear rule applies to everyone who contributes to a Roth IRA, whether theyre 59 12 or 105 years old. It will depend, then, and when she takes funds and how much as compared to her basis. From Yes, another Roth 5year rule is for conversions. Each carries its own 5year clock. She wont be subject to this rule. ideally some kind of welcome bonus even if its 150200 bucks You dont need a Bonus for retirement investing. You dont need to work on incentives. You just need to work on being helpful and getting her some lower risk with better performance. It isnt clear if CB is holding annuities for this person. That one of the investment types, and not an account, and thats why it matters to note the holdings. Yes, you would talk to the ED Jones person, but they are paid advisor group. You also can Rollover a Trad IRA to a Vanguard IRA this means Account and then investreinvest the holdings. You can do a direct trusteetotrustee transfer for the holdings, often in kind from a Trad IRA to a Roth IRA, but that is a taxable conversion. I do not recommend conversions unless the person is under 70 or really wont touch this money for 1015 years. Thats because they are already taking RMDs and paying taxes, so moving it and paying taxes, then needing to take some as distributions anyway, just churned their account a bit.

I appreciate all of the advice Ive gotten from the few subs Ive posted this in, really been a big help. Ive objectively been a positive benefit on her finances and not getting scammed, I was literally at her house when she was about to get scammed for who knows how much...her friend got taken for her savings which is awful. She was mid download of a remote control phone app, no joke. But I know what I know, and I know what Im absolutely fucking clueless about. At least thats what my therapist says, just in a much softer tone. It was one thing to get from some savings account paying her 0.05 APY that she NEVER touched in to a HYSA. That was even pulling teeth tbh, took months before she agreed, but shes been super open with me and now thinks I know way more than I do lol. Shes also getting more forgetful which is rough to see, and her sons arent around as much as they should be. Shes basically been my mother, I lost mine at 13, dad not long after and she was always there. So I want to be there for her. Ive already talked to a couple places for free and gotten some solid info. Still in very early stages of this, I want to have her sit down with a financial advisor at least once with regards to this account. She seems open to it, she wants me there which is fine. I want to make sure I find the right one, and shes the busiest person her age Ive ever seen lol. Im in no rush though, I want to make that very clear. Shes in the middle of switching CPAs as well, the one she had for 25y retired and she simply just kept going to whoever took over the place. Since then, shes had to pay late fees to the IRS 23 years... albeit very minor, like low 3 figures minor, but still which is ridiculous. No issues like that for 25y, then in the 3y shes been with this new guy there was a mess up like that twice? She said she basically never sees the guy either, has spent maybe a total of 10 minutes in his office in 3 years. Luckily her son has had one for a long time, and its closer than hers was.

Reddit,2024-10-29,"Boeing has successfully raised about 21 billion in a substantial share sale, one of the largest ever for a public company, to strengthen its balance sheet amid ongoing cash burn. The company sold 112.5 million common shares at 143 each, a 7.7 discount from its previous closing price of 155.01. Additionally, Boeing issued 5 billion in depositary shares tied to preferred shares. This capital infusion addresses urgent financial needs under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, especially given the ongoing strike that has halted production of the 737 Max, Boeings key product. The company is projected to use approximately 4 billion in cash in Q4, resulting in an estimated 14 billion free cash outflow for the year. Boeing anticipates continuing cash losses into the first half of next year as it works to ramp up production poststrike. The stock closed down 2.8 at 150.69 on Monday and has seen a 42 decline this year, marking one of the worst performances in the Dow Jones Industrial Average also if youre looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation",Positive,1,0.9999158382415771,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Some minor details in need of correctionclarification. Radar and lidar are also capable of detecting and classifying pedestrians either by themselves or as part of a multimodal sensor suite. In fact they can be better than cameras in some circumstances, low light as you mentioned. Some lidars also give Dopplerrelative speed not sure if Waymos does but I know AURs does. Video processing is necessarily a much more resource intensive task than processing lidar or radar data. Now everyone I know that has radar and lidar also has cameras, so that may not be important but there are probably some optimizations that having multiple sensors allows a reduction in the amount of video that needs to be processed. Rapid iteration is not a differentiator, everyone doing self driving Waymo included can push updates whenever they want. Most also use Continuous integration pipelines. Regulatory hurdles are mostly propagandafake news auto companies self certify for safety, other than FMVSS rules which are testable requirements NHTSA can verify. FMVSS rules are very easy to comply with and say nothing about autonomy. There are some FMVSS changes required to remove steering wheel pedals and other things but those changes have been in process for years and should be done soon if it hasnt already happened, not familiar with the latest status. The easy work around is to simply not delete these until the rules change, theres also a waiver process that some companies I believe have successfully completed to delete these components. The real regulatory hurdle is liability, and needing to pay out millions in damages when a court determines your product killed someone and the manufacturer is liable. In other words the only real barrier is tech readiness. Regulatory hurdles are just an excuse that wallstreet types tend to buy.",Neutral,0,0.9974735379219055,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-29,"There have been examples in the past of other company AH earnings dumpingrising, just for the exact opposite to occur the next morning when the market opens. I think this inverse reaction is unlikely to occur in this instance, but how can you with such confidence with 100 certainty say NVDA wont pump when the market opens? I agree with you that weekly call holders are likely fcked, but so are weekly put holders, depending on their strike price. NVDA IV and premium was so ridiculously inflated that I feel like NVDA needs to go to 110 or lower just for weekly put holders to break even. Quite frankly I think its dumb for anyone to do options trading on NVDA, regardless of whether its ER or a normal period. The premium is always way too expensive. If someone wants to trade NVDA, its much better to trade SPY or one of the other dozens of tickers that basically correlate 11 with NVDA, that are way less expensive.",Neutral,0,0.9954009652137756,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-29,"Lets see here, where to even start... No sane person would argue against NVDAs strong financials right now, although margins have decreased slightly and growth has slowed, they have a solid stream of revenue with consistent demand. REAL demand, with no competitors in the near future. Cisco, Intel, IBM, etc they were all followers of the trend and it was in a market where their technologies were common and competitive. Nvidia didnt follow a trend it made its own, and no one can catch up. Lastly, while I do concede Nvidia is a bit stretched as far as valuation, thats why I believe there will be a correction. The high valuation is SOLIDLY supported by insane growth mostly unheard of in this industry. What killed the trio you mentioned was speculation and lofty valuations. Absolutely not present here. Youre going to make the argument that this entire AI trend is speculation, but again, take a look at NVDAs financials and get back to me.

If you are investing weekly, put 60 in stable stocks like AAPLmsft or funds like vooVTI. Try to buy the same 23 stocks every week. Why? Because the goal is to get to 100 shares of one ticker as soon as possible. Once you get there, you can generate income by selling covered calls every week. Put the rest 40 in options. If you cant buy anything with the 40, just hold cash until you have enough to buy one. Initially, start with relatively safe options. Dont do stuff like rklb.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"I read your entire post including all the links. I didnt listen to the podcast tho. But regardless this is more than most likely did. The fundamental problem with your thesis here is your making a macro call and then trying to apply it to a discrete event occurring very shortly. Even if we agreed that theres power concerns, fiscal concerns, concerns with the overall model of AI, concerns about chip manufacturing and ability Its unlikely any of that is on the ballot on the 28th. Whats going to be the concern is revenues for this quarter hitting towards the top end of expectations or exceeding it and then projections for the upcoming quarters Now maybe some of those issues feed into projections but I sort of doubt it. These are longer term problems, so Id be more willing to bet they become an issue over the next 6 to 18 months rather than in 3 days. So its a pretty regarded take to make based on the thesis. TLDR If you want to make a macro AI thesis you should put the time frame for it to play out at longer than 3 days. More like 618 months.",Negative,-1,0.999936580657959,Reply

But hopefully by next year we some competition. Just think about intel and AMD they both have gpus capable of processing llms and generative ai but for a little bit less than a flagship retail nvidia card you dont get much of the performance so you might as well buy a equally priced nvidia card. They perform far worst and there are not many libraries available so now you create two problems . The lack of support from libraries creates a difficult where you gonna have to either write your own library which requires time and resources from engineers or use the libraries that are already available but you have to jump through so many hoops to make it work and guess less performance that now you wasted time and money . Lets say you try to hire the top of line engineer most of them already have experience with CUDA , if not its easy enough to learn but if you go anywhere else and try to build in house now you gotta add the time to develop and optimize the library to work as good as a CUDA GPU . So its just cheaper and easier to buy NVidia . Even these big companies like META are buying NVidia .

Labor is extremely inefficient so its an easy milestone to cross. Think of the buildings and infrastructure and management required for staff. Then there is all the cars driven to work, all the ACs turned on. All of that is the price of labor and its a lot more than just a salary.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"Buy post puts or gtfo. I read 1 paragraph of the DD before giving up. But GPT read and responded in 5seconds The critique youve provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AIs current trajectory and potential. 1. AI Approaches and Progress The critique dismisses the GPTML approach as a known dead end, but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While its true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fictionlike fantasies e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S., this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT3, GPT4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries. 2. Exponential Investment for Linear Gains The notion of exponential investment for linear gains is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of whats possible. 3. Business Case for AI The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an allencompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decisionmaking, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable. 4. Training Data and Resources Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resourceintensive nature of AI. 5. Nvidias Role While its true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust softwarehardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidias role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete. 6. Investor Expectations The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and longterm potential. In summary, while AIs development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a bubble fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock.",Positive,2,0.8755164742469788,Reply

Its kind of like the Tesla story a couple years ago. Company hits scale in a new market, competition emerges and issues start to crop up, so theres a limit to growth upside.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"Because they are investing in the next wave of labor replacements for the said trillions of future revenue? It turns out you need to invest now to see revenue later. You are also wrong about improvement costs being completely exponential. That is true for the scaling wide increasing parameter count and training time, but scaling vertically is much more efficient. I use the latest models every day for programming and it seems like every week theres something new that can solve some problems the previous model couldnt solve. The current state of the art is focused on improving training and making a corpus of training data have better results. The gains are spectacular. Microsofts Phi 3.5 mini came out last week and has 3.8B parameters. It outperforms Llama 2 70B from a year ago on benchmarks. Thats almost 20x less parameters and possibly training time. They did this by improving training methodology and making training data higher quality. So methodology is leading to huge improvements. Hyper scale companies are continuing to scale wide AND implement these methodologies. This means each generation is getting better and better and we have a while before we get to scraping the bottom of the barrel of the gains.",Positive,1,0.9999949932098389,Reply

Here he is in 2019 openly saying they have no real path to profitability and once we make AI good enough itll just tell us how to make a return.

Theyre just doing the fusion power is 5 years away thing.

The issue isnt that it takes time, the issue is in 2020 when they released GPT3 theyd raised less than 100m, and today theyve raised over 13B, and they dont have a lot to show for that extra 12.9B. Sams talking about burning 50 billion a year to build AGI and its just got people wondering how many rounds well have to go on this before we get whats actually promised. At the end of the day its not his 50 billion to burn, his company isnt profitable so its gotta come from other people who arent going to keep ponying up if theres no progress to show for it.

It can gauge complex situations like accidents or animals running in the road and is often driving better than many humans I know. yes there are companies who are selling real robo taxi services right now one of which being waymo. But if you see the difference of what theyve completed compared to what Tesla is achieving you would be surprised. The current existing robo taxis have tens of thousands of dollars of sensors on them and are geofenced to small mapped out areas. Tesla is selling their vehicles for less than the sensors alone on those vehicles and teslas will eventually have nongeofences full self driving. The calculations are being done in real time by AI trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of real time driving footage from real people. Once completed a Tesla will be able to encounter any road, any situation, anywhere and solve it where as the other companies are focused on tiny areas just to get it working. Thats not to put down what theyve done or say it doesnt have its place but Tesla is aiming for something on a much greater scale and once completed will most likely take over the entire market.",Neutral,0,0.835606038570404,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-23,"2035 is a ways away so it is hard to try and predict what will happen. Regardless of the speedbumps along the way, I see an eventual full transition to electric or at least 90 of vehicles on the road. Not to say we wont have major issues to deal with, I could also see the mandates getting rolled back in certain states. The goal of the electric car is to never have to think about charging it, eventually, everyone will change at home when they go to bed, so why would you want to go somewhere to fill up? The only time most people will be charging away from home will be over long distances which is what superchargers are for and eventually battery tech will improve, we already have comparable ranges to ICE vehicles. The new model 3 long range gets 363 which is more than my small Toyota. The 38 revenue from carbon credits is just from a recent quarter most likely because they have a backlog of them and this is a rough time for sales so they need to claim them in order to help prop up the business while theyre suffering. Tesla will survive long term. The vehicle sector of tesla is definetly the most prominent portion currently, but long term it will not be. That is why they market themselves as a technology company, they ened ot sell the cars to people first for them to want to purchase FSD eventually once it gets better. Having an EV will lead them down the road into Tesla energy by having battery walls installed or solar tiles on their roofs. The energy sector profits more than doubled last quarter for tesla, this is the beginning of the transition of profits into other sectors. Teslas are already cheap enough a new model 3 costs about the same as a toyota corolla, not to say 26k is cheap by any means. I definetly wouldnt buy one new but a lot of people would the F150 is the most popular vehicle in america and costs 45k. People will be happy to switch once they learn about the benefits, right now there is a lot of boomer hate against sustainable things and EVs and that will change as the young generations take over and become wealthy and settled into thei rjobs and can make the transition.

Reddit,2024-08-23,"Ive watched videos on the Chinese EVs and a lot of them are very cheap and affordable but theyre also extremely low quality and the self driving is awful. I agree they have the potential to take away market share from tesla but Im doubtful on how much. Right now Tesla already has dominance in the US EV sector so it will be tough for the Chinese cars to break into the market at first, if they can even get here. Most US politics are against giving too much power to the Chinese and I think part of why Elon is being friendly with trump is because he is betting on him tarifing the shit out of those Chinese EVs so theyre more expensive than Teslas. I agree with competition will get stronger stronger no doubt, supposedly BMW even surpassed Teslas quartet EV sales in Europe recently. But nobody in the sector is as diversified as Tesla, cars is just one aspect of their long term game plan and theyre already dominating. Also nobody else is working on self driving like they are which will be a huge game changer once completed. Why would you buy a cheap Chinese EV once Tesla is the only true self driving, or why would you buy a car at all if you can order a Tesla to drive you to work for a fraction of what an uber would cost? The teslas are getting cheaper and cheaper, right now you can buy a Tesla model 3 for 26k after rebates, thats getting as cheap a Toyota Corolla, which has nowhere near the tech features. Think of apple, how many companies have better devices than them with better features and cheaper? And still iPhone is the most sold smartphone in the us, its not always about being the best its about knowing your consumer and how to appeal.

Reddit,2024-08-13,"I joined in with a 50 position this week. Kinda hoping for a market correction so I can load up 100. Theyre projected to grow 2025 conservatively over the next couple years. That puts them at 2B rev in 3 years, 20 EBITDA. In 3 years theyll have capacity to build 400 satellites a year. The contract with Telesat was 198 satellites for 2.1B and they have another unnamed contract that should be announced soon for 750M. 400 satellites a year could potentially bring in 4B year on the high end not counting their robotics segments, future expansion etc. Overall, I think theyre pretty undervalued, but by using judgment on current market conditions, Im going to hold some cash to be able to take advantage of a random sell off",Positive,1,0.9999977350234985,Reply
