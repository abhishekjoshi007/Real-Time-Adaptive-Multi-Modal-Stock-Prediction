If the US or US states started doing that, everymany Americans would immediately have a trusted card that could be used by Visa, MC, etc. Similarly, nearly everyone has a smart phone with Apple Pay and Google Wallet. Its only a matter of time before they make their own cards and immediately cut into that market. That said, if the US or any states were actually interested in ending Visas monopoly, theyd have already started down that path.

Feds biggest worry is wage price spiral which was a problem after pandemic due to labor shortage, now it does not seem to be a problem since companies are not hiring aggressively. That said, I dont think Fed is going to cut rates aggressively, rates are not very high at the moment, we do not want inflation to come back again, that will set things back. They will go slow and easy, 25bps cuts, unless inflation is really down below 2.5 consistently, at the moment it is not below 2.5 and it is too early, we had only like 45 months of inflation below 3."

Deflation is bad for the economy because it discourages spending, investment, and consumption at the macro level. Sure, deflation would benefit inelastic essentials like food, but in a service based economy that relies heavily on capital investment and consumption, 8 deflation over several years would have disastrous effects. Deflation increases the purchasing power per dollar, which on the surface sounds good until you realize it also means wages will go down. It also discourages investment at all levels since rampant deflation would create a sentiment that its better to hold off since you can get more for your money later on. Why take the risk investing in the market or investing in RD if you could earn 8 just having the money sit in a bank account. High deflation would also decimate people with mortgages or loans since the payments on the loan remain the same while the purchasing power per dollar and their wages would be going down. So their monthly mortgage payments would be going up over time in real terms. High inflation is also bad, but a small amount of inflation like 2 benefits everyone because it means spending and investment is encouraged since money is losing 2 of its value if its doing nothing, and payments on mortgages and loans go down in real terms over long periods. Overall, deflation or zero inflation creates a culture of saving like in Japan and a small amount of inflation creates a culture of spendinginvesting."

But somehow everyone has been brainwashed into this idea of a downward spiral of deflation. Everyone old enough to buy goods just experienced massive inflation.

Now they just cant. The massive backlog is both a blessing and a curse. Boeing cant push the increased labor cost to the airliners because the prices were already negotiated, they can only pass on the extra cost due to inflation. BA just cant afford 40 Pension for 33,000 people while operating at a loss for the last 5 years. I get it, people like to point out that Dave sucked and got 33 million its now around half that since its stock, not cash. Take all of that money away and its 190year for each employee truly a nonfactor. The engineers union is also dumb as fuck. They think if the IAM union gets more, they can also get more next year. The money bucket is only so big, giving one group a big slice means theres less for others. In the end, they all suffer hoping for a 40 Pension dream in the sky. Theres no winner in the end."

Early on its the techies and innovators who make the company grow by creating the new technologyproducts, and improving on the previous creations. But then as the company grows bigger the people who increase the sales and make the company more money are the marketers, so more and more of the upper ranks of the company get filled with marketers and money people, and less with the tech people who built the company from the ground up. And without the innovatorsetc. who designed and built the products running things the company stagnates and ceases to innovate. And then eventually someone else more innovative comes along and topples them with a newer invention. Boeing has clearly been hallowed out the marketers, but we still need someone new to come along and topple them with newer innovations in the space."

As 247 Wall Street reported at the time, Boeings defense, space and security businesses have as their primary customers U.S. and overseas governments. The divisions backlog for defense and services is 62 billion, of which 30 is from customers outside America. Revenue from these operations is almost certain to be steady or to rise. The same cant be said more than four years later for Boeings commercial business. Breaking up the company might be the only way to save Boeing, and to ensure the Department of Defense can continue work with one of its biggest contractors."

Software grows in complexity like many engineering systems nonlinearly as lines of code increase and various projects connect, which they frequently have to, for software to function. Why does this make it harder? Mainly due to the fact that you cannot easily separate software systems like you might separate mechanical systems like HVAC from landing gear. There are more parts to software call them libraries, function, methods, projects or whatever you want and they have to interconnect and communicate to the tune of millions of lines of code supported by thousands of programmers all over the place. To make matters worse, we will open the software to Joe Schmoe and his merry band of vacationers who each have a different smartphone made by god knows who from whatever country which may or may not have the latest security patches, running whatever app written by some dude in his garage, all connected to the planes internet network... what can go wrong? This is the problem with public facing. Never mind the infinite number of attack vectors just for being online exposing any vulnerability to the millions of lines of code running on all these devices... Last, planes are not public facing. They are literally gated and monitored at all times by ports, police and other agencies. You dont have to design a plane in such a way that someone cant steal the air bags... that isnt a realistic worry. But you do have to design software exactly like that to prevent privacy data from leaking or worse, plane systems get exposed due to some idiot network engineering design... Software has no port guards, or police to physically secure the medium. Its just a programmer vs bad guys and dumb dumb Joe Schmoe. Here is an interesting factoid. Did you know that the 747 has over 8mil lines of code just for the avionics and online support systems? Total flight software is something like 15mil lines of code."

The power puck, the glasses and the wristband thing. Its not just glasses. Its 3 things. The glasses are too thick for prime time. They will have to figure out how to chop that thickness almost in half, which could be impossible. They also need to dramatically increase the resolution. Increasing the FOV would be great, but I think theyre pretty much hitting a hard limit with it. Still a solid decade away from a real AR glasses contender"

Its also more compact and therefore doesnt feel as heavy. Those factors mean more comfort overall and less headaches with extended use. There are some nice looking games coming out soon as well. The big problem I have so far is the lack of good and functional apps built for the devices. Like, why do we not have a Hulu or Disney plus app? Thats really my big complaint the developers of apps arent supporting the devices, which means they become niche and people would rather have their smartphones.

Unfortunately the passthrough is just not quite there yet to make it usable for long periods of time for me personally. Thats why Meta is making glasses so you dont need passthrough. Even though theres benefits, its hard to convince people to do their entertainment, exercise, and productivity inside of VRAR when the drawbacks are so apparent. Again, I love my Quest 3 though and recommend it to people, but theres a ways to go before it will get widespread adoption. Itll get there, Meta is doing a great job imo in innovating in this space."

Having played significantly with OCR Optical character recognition trying to apply it for a project at work, I have no faith at all it could translate the text on random signs into another language. It likely wont even get the original language right. The AR art displays is an interesting idea though. I could also see it being used as an enhancement for Pokemon GO style games. The other thing you have to think about is that a lot of this processing would need to be done locally by the glasses. If it requires too much processing and has to be sent to the cloud and back, the lag is going to mess with you pretty bad.

The bull case for NVIDIA, despite the potential cracks in the AI scaling hypothesis, remains compelling due to a number of factors 1. AI Beyond Scaling Diversification of Architectures While the scaling hypothesis may face limitations, NVIDIA is not solely reliant on larger models for growth. The shift towards diverse architecturessuch as edge computing, federated learning, and more efficient, adaptable modelsstill heavily depends on advanced hardware. NVIDIAs innovation in custom AI chips and specialized GPUs for varied workloads ensures that it continues to dominate, even as the industry pivots away from pure scale. 2. AI Software Ecosystem NVIDIAs CUDA platform, AI software stack, and Deep Learning SDKs offer essential tools for AI developers. These tools are deeply integrated across the AI research and enterprise ecosystems, which means that even if scaling slows, NVIDIAs software dominance secures its position as a key player. Moreover, AI companies are dependent on NVIDIAs endtoend platform, from training to deployment, and this dependency is unlikely to change even if the emphasis shifts from scale to smarter, more efficient architectures. 3. Enterprise and Data Center Expansion Even beyond researchdriven AI, enterprise adoption of AI is growing rapidly. Companies across industriesfinance, healthcare, and logisticsare integrating AI into their operations, and this trend fuels continued demand for highperformance computing HPC solutions. NVIDIAs foothold in data centers is a major asset, as demand for AIpowered insights and automation continues to grow. The company is positioned to benefit from AIdriven automation, which is expected to scale massively in the next few years. 4. AI in Autonomous Systems NVIDIAs leadership in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other AIdriven automation solutions offers another strong growth avenue. The companys Drive platform for autonomous driving and its investments in industrial robots and AIpowered edge devices place NVIDIA in a favorable position as automation accelerates across multiple industries. 5. Gaming and Virtual Worlds Metaverse While AI remains the main growth driver, NVIDIAs core business in gaming is still robust, and its investment in the metaverseparticularly via its Omniverse platformis positioned for future growth. The convergence of AI, VR, and GPUpowered graphics in virtual worlds will open up new revenue streams, ensuring that NVIDIAs hardware remains in demand across various sectors beyond traditional AI use cases. 6. AI Custom Silicon and Competition NVIDIA is investing heavily in custom silicon AIspecific hardware. The Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchip, alongside nextgen H100 GPUs, cater to evolving needs in AI and HPC. These chips optimize AI workloads and enable costeffective scaling, keeping NVIDIA ahead of competitors like AMD and Intel. 7. AI as a Deflationary Force The massive potential of AI to create efficiencies across industries means that the macroeconomic environment will continue to favor companies like NVIDIA. As AI proves its worth in reducing operational costs, improving supply chains, and automating workflows, NVIDIAs role in supplying the necessary infrastructure will keep demand strong. Conclusion Bull Case for NVDA Despite possible challenges to the scalability hypothesis, NVIDIA remains a key enabler of the AI economy. Its leadership in hardware and software, expansion into new markets like autonomous vehicles, and diverse revenue streams provide a strong foundation for continued growth. Even if the AI bubble bursts in some areas, the underlying technological advancements and enterprise applications are likely to sustain NVIDIAs trajectory."

Of course, that now looks very stupid in hindsight really, it was looking possible it was wrong by the time we had FOMC in June, but it was absolutely a thing. Folks got duped by the new year effects twice in a row.

But its an interesting thought exercise If you were given 85 million signing bonus plus an even sicker compensation package, what changes would you make to prove you were worth it? Myself, my forte is in making services and products undeniably great, and letting quality drive the business side. Not to the exclusion of shrewd business strategy and tactics, but I just put the priority on having something great that people want, and letting that be the flywheel. So for me, Id finally accept the incredibly common perception that Starbucks actual coffee is mediorceburnt. Weve seen others publicly and with humility accept and fix that... see McCafe, DPZ, CMG, etc. For those who say you cant make that change! I say you cant expect big changes unless you make changes. For those who say the old is good enough, I point to the stock performance as proof its not. Id be the best quality and go with a nicer but more broadly appealing taste profile. As SBUX, wed have the scale and resources to get the very best while still benefitting from scale. Im not sweating about margins in the first wave of this transformation because frankly a drink that you can charge a food price for suggests margin not be a problem over time. Second Id embrace some tech. People are kind of over the myth that you need a slow paced barista teasing out your drink for five minutes. CafeLux and Nespresso have shown you can get 90 of great coffee or cold drinks without lifting a finger. Id seek to take the best of learnings from those and apply them to a faster service model. Maybe that means the barista role is to focus on the part only they can do, and do best, but spares them from the other 90. Thats still TBD, but the goal of pumping out the actual drinks, cold or hot, WAY faster is not negotiable. In parallel wed have some kind of highly mediamentionable value choices. Perhaps not the 99 cent coffee that every pundit thinks they were the first to think of, since it would only be reinforcing the oldbad taste and also trading short term traffic surge which isnt the problem for weaker reputation and perception. But maybe some quick and easy 3 buck options that are enough to generate broad public knowledge. The taste and speed have to be newsworthy upgrades. The value options must also generate a buzz, but should be aligned with supporting not undermining the first two priorities. There would be more phases, but the emergency mission would be whole new supply and taste, combined with huge efficiency boost by automating that which can be. That phase alone probably justifies yesterdays 20 billion move."

This guy better do a real good job with how much they are handing over. Do you know what I mean? Its a big job sure but this mentality of thinking just this guy can do the job looks stupid to me. Maybe Im wrong, I guess the important thing to them is that they spend the money on the guy they think has the best odds of accomplishing their goals. And id take the money too, but its hard to not feel negative about one man getting all this money but I do suppose he has a big job ahead that will likely be stressful. But doesnt everyone feel that way about their jobs....ok Ill stop. Lol. And I read a comment, they have taken out seating. Yeah Im sure you need to get paid a few million for being that issue to light lol. I hardly ever go there because Im not into spending my money on that, dont go to Dunkin either. But the one thing I can recall about Starbucks is how the food in display looks like fake cardboard or something and isnt appetizing looking at all. I felt like asking if food is real. I think I tried it once bc I wanted to know if it was real lol, it was good I believe but I was definitely hungry after still. Idk they want to sell us small food and expensive coffee and theyll pay a lot money to do it. His first idea probably will be adding burritos to the menu. Lol"

It felt inevitable that with more and more local shops selling the same product and experience as SBUX AND premium shops taking high end consumers they were going to lose share. I cant speak for everyones experience but my local Chipotle has gone downhill. How is this such a great hire? Prices are very high, very inconsistent product out of stock of product, quality problems, portioning weirdly, generally felt much more transactional in the store with mobile ordering. I used to eat at Chipotle 12x a week and now I actively avoid it to go to a local knock off thats much better."

If the company viewed the other leaders within the company as equally competent to lead the company as the CEO, but cheaper, they wouldve simply hired those leaders instead. But the difference between a good CEO and one 1 worse than that good CEO is hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars for very large companies. Duke Energy literally pays McKinsey to completely control restructuring of their entire company. No. Theyre paying McKinsey to execute a restructuring for them. Thats not outsourcing decisionmaking to McKinsey the company made the decision to restructure, and they hired experts people who had, ya know, done this sort of thing before to come in and tell them the best way to do it. Who do you think would be a better fit to do that job internally? theyve got a CEO getting 20M bonuses while they lay people off and restructure the entire company every year. ... Every year? Looks like theyre going through layoffs now because they had a bad year last year, but looking at WARN Act data, it looks like their last restructuring was 2014."

My wife is a lawyer and has personally settled cases that their company expected to win because settling was the cheaper option. 2. The lawsuit had to do with defects with the car, and the central point had little to do with Teslas or Musks claims about autonomous driving. As for Thunderf00t I think just being a YouTuber doesnt automatically discredit you. It doesnt mean hes wrong, it just means that Im not going to go watch his video on the offchance he might be right. He doesnt have any credentials to make his videos worth watching to me why would I consider him trustworthy? And Thunderf00t happens to be a reputable researcher in chemistry Why do you think that makes him an expert on EVs or Tesla? Theranos. 11 years 3 months prison for CEO Theranos and Holmes being guilty of fraud doesnt make TeslaMusk guilty of fraud. In fact, the fact that she was prosecuted for fraud suggests that our legal system does, in fact, chase these allegations. So why did Holmes and Theranos get prosecuted, and Musk doesnt, when Musk is easily more notable and publicfacing? 2016 article Elon Musk says fully selfdriving Tesla cars already being built No, thats the clickbait headline. The article actually says that he said All new Tesla models are being built with hardware to enable them to be fully selfdriving, Elon Musk has announced. Having the hardware to be selfdriving doesnt mean that the car is currently capable of selfdriving. The German government has called on Elon Musks company to stop using the Autopilot branding Ok? That doesnt mean hes committed fraud lol. As Elon Musk promises full selfdriving, experts worry Tesla is using consumers as guinea pigs Nothing in this article suggests that Musk has made fraudulent claims. alleging that the Autopilot system in Tesla cars How is this linked to Musk making fraudulent claims? sued after they were later presented with price hikes and delays How is this criminal fraud? They sued for damages and won them because Tesla didnt live up to its contract, but thats not fraud, and its especially not fraud from Musk something his company doesnt deliver on is not personal liability for a criminal offense. This one is unresolved and I trust musk will be condemned This is maybe the only one that would prove your point... but its unresolved, and its odd that you think hes going to lose, given that hes been sued for false claims in the past and the case was dismissed. And there are so many more including child labor, racism, labor rights..... This sentence represents the issue with your entire comment. It seems that I need to remind you that Im not making any argument about Musk being a good person. You said He should be in prison for financial fraud And now youve simply proceeded to not make any arguments about that, and have moved the goalposts to other topics which I did not make any comment about. Control your thoughts and stay on topic. This is not a place to comment generally on Musk, because I dont give a fuck about Musk. I care about you making claims that he should be in jail for financial fraud without making any solid argument for him having actually committed that act."

Youll say oh but thats not a crime to add fake cheers in a video ok shut up and listen. The reason his downfall is taking such a long time is precisely because of people like you and his whole image being that of a genius entrepreneur. I strongly recommend you watch at least one Thunderf00t video where he debunks Musk, itll take you less time than to keep arguing here. Thunderf00t is credible and he is in fact an expert on EVs more than 99 of people because what makes EVs special is the battery and hes a chemist. His channel is a debunking channel. He debunks fake inventions and things that get covered on the news while obviously gigantic scams.

Our health system is predatory to the extreme and only accessible to the wealthiest among us. Our police force is murderously violent, and protects corporate interests above the citizenry. Our financial systems have been completely overrun by billionaire fraudsters and now operate on boom and bust cycles that pilfer public funds. Our food production has been brutally industrialized and our food itself has been stuffed with toxic additives and overprocessed to squeeze out every last cent of profit. Unions and workers rights have been demonized and systematically deconstructed. Worker pay has been under gradual decline for half a century, while housing has become yet another investment vehicle causing costs to skyrocket. Our politicians, fully and openly bought by the oligarchs, obstruct any attempt at change while engaging in public hedonism. And all the while, we are drowning in unending propaganda pushing American exceptionalism, praising rugged individualism, and demonizing kindness, generosity, and collectiveness. So, yeah. Things arent great here. The capitalists have us in a pretty dark hole, but were working on it.

I bet this new CEO simply sees it as a challenge as an A type, with no thought to the product or employees aside from dashboards and targets. Far from the original concept of what exactly in the coffee market are we trying to corner. Hell, thats what the shareholders hired him on, not the reality that most people have acces to better local coffee shops with friendly local staff and management. So he is hired to cut costs, like a lot of other temporary CEOs. I believe the real brain rot is in shareholder and wall street attitude towards fully matured business models. They should be on cruise control paying out dividends or securing their large moat. Instead they must produce innovation or margin expansion and act like they are about to release a cancer cure at all times. 2x returns on PE expansion or it aint worth it, even to a retiree stock portfolio. Those investors if so desperate should honestly sell their starnucks and look for newcomers in the coffee market if they want 3x returns, but no. Risk imploding the company out of a desire for too the moon or bust. Crypto and GME are a symptom, not a cause, of this mindset."

Obviously the US has a huge homeless problem so its funny you should mention that. We can definitely discuss with more detail what Egypt is doing wrong There is almost nothing done right, but I just want to point out I didnt say I was personally surprised at the behavior, just saying that American views towards jobs as a generalization obviously is less empathetic than other places around the world. Business is conducted in a more ruthless way. Most Egyptians would not find it ok that, if they already had a 100 million, theyd put 10,000 people out of a job to make another 100 million. That doesnt they are angels walking the earth, they have other things that are flawed. So for example I find Americans much more willing to stand up for what they believe compared to Egyptians. So its just different approaches worldviews rather than one being better than the other."

Android can be sustainable on just its licensing fees. It would also solve the Google Play stranglehold issue and ensure no favouritism towards Pixel devices in future.

Google play services would no longer be relevant to phones, so Samsungs OS likely becomes an isolated platform worth targeting like iPhone, with their own App Store taking 30. Over time, diverging operating systems would mean apps will only target the biggest players. With no Google services, the Android company loses relevance. The next big app is only available on Samsung Galaxy and iPhone because they have the largest market shares. Small phone manufacturers like Nothing and OnePlus can no longer compete without apps, they cant afford the RD of their own OS, and neither can the Android company without income from services nor big manufacturer license fees. Consumers now have less hardware choice. They end up with 2 primary operating systems, but now Samsung doesnt allow other brands to benefit from their work the way Google did.

But beyond Walmart, the pickings are slim. Country Mart, a local chain, has two small grocery stores, each about a 15minute drive from downtown Lawton, on opposite sides of the metro area. Aldi operates a small store in the city. Williams Discount Food has an outlet on the far northeastern edge of the metro, in the town of Elgin, a 20minute drive from central Lawton.

The fact is that Chrome collects more data than any of the other browsers, yet is the only one that doesnt appear to collect any data that isnt linked to user identities. This is a much more shocking illustration of the different philosophies at play. Chrome hasnt even attempted to protect its users privacy in this way. This isnt about specific data fields, this is about an overarching attitude to privacy. It is technically true Chrome does not directly make revenue for Google because it is free to use. But this is a bit disingenuous as an assertion because Google sells access to data collected by Chrome to advertisers, who use it to target you with ads all across the internet. This leads to undisclosed fucktons of revenue. The biggest change is Ad Topics, a.k.a. the Topics API if youre a huge nerd whos been following this stuff for years. With Topics, Chrome will keep track of all the websites youre looking at and sort you into a variety of categories. This tracking happens in your browser and the data stays on your device. Neither Google nor anyone else gets to see your browsing history or learn anything about you as an individual throughout this process. Websites and advertising companies will know theres a person interested in a certain Topic, but they wont be able to tell who you are specifically. Edit formatting"

Android is open source, meaning Samsung can copy it and make their own locked down version if they want to. Without Google being attached to Android, they would spend the money bringing the OS in house and cut the license payments out of the equation. Theyre already ready for replacing play with galaxy store, and with so much financial incentive theres no way they wouldnt. Why do they need to let Android collect the 30 cut of app purchases when they now control the platform? Also, its hard to get people to update their phones when its free.

But its just not Samsung but other major noniPhone maker. Just look at linux and its various flavors which is why there isnt a specific PCLaptop manufacturer that would sell a linux version. They pretty much all sell Windows pc because its consistent and just works out of the box. Most phone makers have a small software team to tweak android to their liking. Charging for updates, Im not talking about with every small update but simply major ones. E.g Win 10 to Win 11. Again, for a small fee, some people would consider it. You cant make the price prohibitive like what MS does with windows. Who wants to shell out over 100 just to get new OS when the old one works just fine.

Gross services volume is basically the same as it was a year ago. Revenue is only up because they keep increasing the take rate. 19 of what the clients pay now goes to UpWork. Their revenue guidance for Q3 is less than what they made in Q2. So they might enter a phase of negative growth now. Caused by declining usage which cannot be offset by further increasing the take rate. They keep focussing on enterprise deals and neglect the marketplace experience. Although the marketplace is the 6x bigger business. Clients who use the marketplace still get 3 ! invoices and receipts per week ! even if they just work with one freelancer. Who wouldnt want to add 19 to their freelancer cost and the hassle to add 12 documents per month to their tax paperwork? TlDr They focus on their sales team, neglect the product, make it more and more expensive, usage growth declines. They still have a great starting point as the market leader in work marketplaces. But unless they change the approach, I think nothing will come out of it. If the business slips away, my hope is that a new, more product oriented CEO will come into play."

Average spent per buyer is 4x smaller on Fiverr compared to UpWork. When you commission a onetime job like a logo, it doesnt matter if you pay 100 or 130. That wont make you take the job off the platform. But when you work with a freelancer on a constant basis, you start to think about why you pay UpWork every month too. Because the only thing you get for it is the invoicing.

And with the guidance of 6 revenue for Q3, it stands to be expected that usage will start shrinking now. Despite over a hundred million Dollars spent on sales and marketing per year. My interpretation UpWorks service is good at the beginning of the user journey. To match buyers and sellers. But then it becomes a chore. Because of the weekly invoice cycle and the separate invoicing from sellers and UpWork. That makes it an 8x worse solution than direct seller to buyer invoices. UpWork gained a massive amount of users during covid. And now those users abandon the service. Its a long way down to precovid levels. It can make the business decline for years. On the upside, UpWork might have the potential to become as big as the other market place leaders. Amazon, Uber, Booking, AirBnB, Shopify etc are all orders of magnitude larger than UpWork and I dont see a reason the leading work market place shouldnt become as big as those. But I think that would require a shift in the way UpWork is run. As the current approach to growth is not working. As can be seen in the numbers."

As for the user growth, it isnt actually declining. The of active clients is growing. Last year, they announced a change in their fee structure. It used to be multitier 20, then 10, then 5. So, the larger the contract, the lower the fee UpWork takes. The new structure is a flat 10 fee for all. I do think some contracts were taken outside of UpWork, which led to a reduction in the average spend per client which is reflected in the Gross service volume decline. I do think this is temporary, as with any price increase decision made."

So basically what the number tells us is that they lost more clients in 2024Q2 than they won in 2023Q2. Still, the 6 active clients YoY look kinda good, so if those would be the only numbers we have QoQ and YoY, I would say I dont know what to think. Lets wait until next quarter. But we also have the guidance of 6 in revenue QoQ. The worst guidance in the history of UpWork. And they explain it with negative trends in the topoffunnel which could mean active clients or spent per client I think and expect it to continue We did see those trends get slightly worse in June and July And they talk about working on anticircumvention efforts in the call. You can find it in the transcript. Which should mean they will try to stop buyers and sellers from leaving the platform once they have found each other. Why would they have to do that if their users wanted to use the invoicing service they provide? The users dont want it. I dont think you can grow a business by saying We have a good service and a bad service. We give you a good service for a few days and then well force you to use our bad service forever."

Open AIs ChatGPT has parameter counts rumored to be in the trillions and llama 3.1 has around 400 billion parameters. Even with this vast difference in size Im looking at this like brain power llama is competing quite well because they found that if they just spend way more time training the model it magnifies its ability. I think these findings are probably having an effect on the development of GPT5 or whatever they plan to name it. This leads me to hypothesize that anyone can do anything if you have enough time and effort. This still brings you to a fork in the road.

A custodial Roth IRA should be opened when your child is a teen and gets their first job. Then you can contribute on their behalf up to the amount they earn, or the annual maximum at that time, whichever is less. Do not listen to people who tell you to count chores as earned income. Thats not allowed and the IRS is not stupid. Finally, do not save. You want to invest. Bank accounts, CDs, Treasury bonds, etc. are not ideal for the long term time horizon of a young child. Purchase equities so you can leverage the stock markets ongoing trend of long term growth."

If they are fiduciaries lordy, I hope so for those rates then you already have someone you can talk to about this. Also, I understand the desire to minimize taxes, but remember that someone is going to pay taxes on that money in CB at some point. If you move it to a Roth, then its already taxed and she or her heirs can pull it taxfree. AND its not subject to RMDs. It might be reasonable to just do a Roth conversion for the CB money or several over a couple years depending on where she is in the tax and IRMAA brackets. Max out the tax bracket shes in and you can probably convert in a couple years without triggering unnecessary taxes or and IRMAA cliff. Lastly, you posted this in a couple places .. .might as well hit rretirement as well. That seems like your target audience."

Yes, the government requires this and provides the table for how much to take, based on the FMV of the accounts at prior year end and the persons age, which I dont see where you told us this important piece of information. but I also dont want her to have to pay 20 tax on the money right away. Anything that is removed from a taxable retirement account, such as Trad IRA or 401k, is taxable as ordinary income. It may or may not be 20. There is withholding, which is deducted at the time of the distribution, for retirement accounts. Thats likely the 20 you mention, which is not Taxes. Its a prepayment against her 1040. a big chunk in a vanguard 20 and then I invested the other 19. Vanguard is a brokerage. Which funds? Invested the other 19 in what? A perspective of the mix helps. Shes a single, widow, head of household thats old enough to hit any qualifier for tax stuff. Shes retired. The 5y rule wouldnt apply to her, I know that. Yes, there are a number of 5year rules for Roth. Yes, the accountbased Roth IRA fiveyear rule says you cannot withdraw earnings taxfree until its been at least five years since you first contributed to a Roth IRA account. This fiveyear rule applies to everyone who contributes to a Roth IRA, whether theyre 59 12 or 105 years old. It will depend, then, and when she takes funds and how much as compared to her basis. From Yes, another Roth 5year rule is for conversions. Each carries its own 5year clock. She wont be subject to this rule. ideally some kind of welcome bonus even if its 150200 bucks You dont need a Bonus for retirement investing. You dont need to work on incentives. You just need to work on being helpful and getting her some lower risk with better performance. It isnt clear if CB is holding annuities for this person. That one of the investment types, and not an account, and thats why it matters to note the holdings. Yes, you would talk to the ED Jones person, but they are paid advisor group. You also can Rollover a Trad IRA to a Vanguard IRA this means Account and then investreinvest the holdings. You can do a direct trusteetotrustee transfer for the holdings, often in kind from a Trad IRA to a Roth IRA, but that is a taxable conversion. I do not recommend conversions unless the person is under 70 or really wont touch this money for 1015 years. Thats because they are already taking RMDs and paying taxes, so moving it and paying taxes, then needing to take some as distributions anyway, just churned their account a bit. And as pointed out, watch her income tax bracket, for triggering IRMAA. Thats an expensive lesson."

Youre eligible because you have earned income, such as wages or other work compensation. None of this idea relates to your retiree."

I appreciate all of the advice Ive gotten from the few subs Ive posted this in, really been a big help. Ive objectively been a positive benefit on her finances and not getting scammed, I was literally at her house when she was about to get scammed for who knows how much...her friend got taken for her savings which is awful. She was mid download of a remote control phone app, no joke. But I know what I know, and I know what Im absolutely fucking clueless about. At least thats what my therapist says, just in a much softer tone. It was one thing to get from some savings account paying her 0.05 APY that she NEVER touched in to a HYSA. That was even pulling teeth tbh, took months before she agreed, but shes been super open with me and now thinks I know way more than I do lol. Shes also getting more forgetful which is rough to see, and her sons arent around as much as they should be. Shes basically been my mother, I lost mine at 13, dad not long after and she was always there. So I want to be there for her. Ive already talked to a couple places for free and gotten some solid info. Still in very early stages of this, I want to have her sit down with a financial advisor at least once with regards to this account. She seems open to it, she wants me there which is fine. I want to make sure I find the right one, and shes the busiest person her age Ive ever seen lol. Im in no rush though, I want to make that very clear. Shes in the middle of switching CPAs as well, the one she had for 25y retired and she simply just kept going to whoever took over the place. Since then, shes had to pay late fees to the IRS 23 years... albeit very minor, like low 3 figures minor, but still which is ridiculous. No issues like that for 25y, then in the 3y shes been with this new guy there was a mess up like that twice? She said she basically never sees the guy either, has spent maybe a total of 10 minutes in his office in 3 years. Luckily her son has had one for a long time, and its closer than hers was. So thatll be good. Anyway thanks again guys. Best wishes."

Pay taxes and do Roth, or a rollover IRA where Id get like 5 on the cash in a brokerage account were two things suggested. Ill reply again within a week or so after I talk to those people then talk to her. My first question to her was does she have a financial advisor and she said no.

First question you need to ask any of them is, are you a fiduciary, bound to give advice that benefits XXXX? They have a legal obligation to act in the best interest of you or in this case your relative instead of the company they work for. Someone asked me why I want her to make on her , which I thought was a wild question. Isnt that the point? Just bc she can pay her expenses means she shouldnt make more money? Yeah, this is just weird. As if she wouldnt want to leave a legacy i.e., money to her heirs, charity, etc. I mean making sure shes taken care of is paramount, but if she had the ability to do more I would think she would want to."

The company sold 112.5 million common shares at 143 each, a 7.7 discount from its previous closing price of 155.01. Additionally, Boeing issued 5 billion in depositary shares tied to preferred shares. This capital infusion addresses urgent financial needs under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, especially given the ongoing strike that has halted production of the 737 Max, Boeings key product. The company is projected to use approximately 4 billion in cash in Q4, resulting in an estimated 14 billion free cash outflow for the year. Boeing anticipates continuing cash losses into the first half of next year as it works to ramp up production poststrike. The stock closed down 2.8 at 150.69 on Monday and has seen a 42 decline this year, marking one of the worst performances in the Dow Jones Industrial Average also if youre looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation"

It will happen, just may be a bit. I have locked in a 7 return and feel that this could easily go up 50 in the next 6 months to get back to the price it was 60 days ago. There has been no dilution, the ceo just moved some of his shares to public float so they can qualify for SP 500 and own more of the suns.

Radar and lidar are also capable of detecting and classifying pedestrians either by themselves or as part of a multimodal sensor suite. In fact they can be better than cameras in some circumstances, low light as you mentioned. Some lidars also give Dopplerrelative speed not sure if Waymos does but I know AURs does. Video processing is necessarily a much more resource intensive task than processing lidar or radar data. Now everyone I know that has radar and lidar also has cameras, so that may not be important but there are probably some optimizations that having multiple sensors allows a reduction in the amount of video that needs to be processed. Rapid iteration is not a differentiator, everyone doing self driving Waymo included can push updates whenever they want. Most also use Continuous integration pipelines. Regulatory hurdles are mostly propagandafake news auto companies self certify for safety, other than FMVSS rules which are testable requirements NHTSA can verify. FMVSS rules are very easy to comply with and say nothing about autonomy. There are some FMVSS changes required to remove steering wheel pedals and other things but those changes have been in process for years and should be done soon if it hasnt already happened, not familiar with the latest status. The easy work around is to simply not delete these until the rules change, theres also a waiver process that some companies I believe have successfully completed to delete these components. The real regulatory hurdle is liability, and needing to pay out millions in damages when a court determines your product killed someone and the manufacturer is liable. In other words the only real barrier is tech readiness. Regulatory hurdles are just an excuse that wallstreet types tend to buy."

I think this inverse reaction is unlikely to occur in this instance, but how can you with such confidence with 100 certainty say NVDA wont pump when the market opens? I agree with you that weekly call holders are likely fcked, but so are weekly put holders, depending on their strike price. NVDA IV and premium was so ridiculously inflated that I feel like NVDA needs to go to 110 or lower just for weekly put holders to break even. Quite frankly I think its dumb for anyone to do options trading on NVDA, regardless of whether its ER or a normal period. The premium is always way too expensive. If someone wants to trade NVDA, its much better to trade SPY or one of the other dozens of tickers that basically correlate 11 with NVDA, that are way less expensive."

And youre right, no, your calls arent going to be worth shit. You made a coin flip and picked the wrong side. It happens. The hot hands fallacy strikes again. I was almost right there with you but my instincts thought better of it. But the results were still good. A company of this size putting up growth numbers like that is impressive and indicative that this huge momentum wave in the sector isnt done. This wasnt a case of not beating expectations. This was a case of not beating the expectation of how much theyd beat expectations. Which is a weird thing to say but it makes sense I promise. It just so happens to come at a time when the market needed reassurance in the wake of rate cut news. They didnt get it. September probably is gonna get pretty rocky. I guess this is where people would say to buy the dip. Dont be surprised if NVDA still manages to cap the year at an all time high."

No sane person would argue against NVDAs strong financials right now, although margins have decreased slightly and growth has slowed, they have a solid stream of revenue with consistent demand. REAL demand, with no competitors in the near future. Cisco, Intel, IBM, etc they were all followers of the trend and it was in a market where their technologies were common and competitive. Nvidia didnt follow a trend it made its own, and no one can catch up. Lastly, while I do concede Nvidia is a bit stretched as far as valuation, thats why I believe there will be a correction. The high valuation is SOLIDLY supported by insane growth mostly unheard of in this industry. What killed the trio you mentioned was speculation and lofty valuations. Absolutely not present here. Youre going to make the argument that this entire AI trend is speculation, but again, take a look at NVDAs financials and get back to me. I know its easy to mislabel NVDA as a pump and dump, but to say Nvidia will be affected by the bubble like CiscoIntcibm is ludicrous. Its like comparing our crash a few weeks ago to 2008, like many people made the mistake of doing."

Because the goal is to get to 100 shares of one ticker as soon as possible. Once you get there, you can generate income by selling covered calls every week. Put the rest 40 in options. If you cant buy anything with the 40, just hold cash until you have enough to buy one. Initially, start with relatively safe options. Dont do stuff like rklb. For instance, AAPL leaps and nvda leaps are good right now. Edit whoever gave the award, thank you!"

The fundamental problem with your thesis here is your making a macro call and then trying to apply it to a discrete event occurring very shortly. Even if we agreed that theres power concerns, fiscal concerns, concerns with the overall model of AI, concerns about chip manufacturing and ability Its unlikely any of that is on the ballot on the 28th. Whats going to be the concern is revenues for this quarter hitting towards the top end of expectations or exceeding it and then projections for the upcoming quarters Now maybe some of those issues feed into projections but I sort of doubt it. These are longer term problems, so Id be more willing to bet they become an issue over the next 6 to 18 months rather than in 3 days. So its a pretty regarded take to make based on the thesis. TLDR If you want to make a macro AI thesis you should put the time frame for it to play out at longer than 3 days. More like 618 months."

They perform far worst and there are not many libraries available so now you create two problems . The lack of support from libraries creates a difficult where you gonna have to either write your own library which requires time and resources from engineers or use the libraries that are already available but you have to jump through so many hoops to make it work and guess less performance that now you wasted time and money . Lets say you try to hire the top of line engineer most of them already have experience with CUDA , if not its easy enough to learn but if you go anywhere else and try to build in house now you gotta add the time to develop and optimize the library to work as good as a CUDA GPU . So its just cheaper and easier to buy NVidia . Even these big companies like META are buying NVidia .

Youre also basically assuming GPT is the only use of gpus. Youd probably be shocked about the simplistic heuristic models that get implemented and just stick for years. With MLAI you can improve just as an example FedExs routing and pricing efficiency. Historic barriers to entry for a specific horizontal or vertical integration are reduced, allowing more economies of scale. Youre not just saving from the bottom line. Youre adding to the top line. AI still has years before it hits significant diminishing returns. Anyways NVDA has doing some funny stuff with the financial statements imo.

There are a lot of hesitations and legal shit to work out before companies are really going to try to replace people. We are not at the realization phase or anywhere close right now. Its still in the new and liability phase. The lemon has hardly been squeezed. 3 compounding gains on knowledge work. Just like investing. If you are learning 20 faster a year, you are going to double the pace at which you learndevelop a technical understanding in 3.6 years. So at double and triple at a macro scale in most scientific areas creates a lot of uncertainty in the capability of narrow and potentially General AI.

Companies are already letting go of staff for certain fields and replacing them with AI. That small slice of the market they can replace currently is worth hundreds of billions, and if they continue to make those linear gains they can replace many trillions. Thats very significant even if it isnt the end all be all. The reason companies continue to buy nvidia is that currently the economics of it are more efficient than labor. Labor is extremely inefficient so its an easy milestone to cross. Think of the buildings and infrastructure and management required for staff. Then there is all the cars driven to work, all the ACs turned on. All of that is the price of labor and its a lot more than just a salary. Datacenters seem inefficient and costly, but the amount of work they do is tremendous and replaces far far far more energy worth of human labor than they cost."

My company have Microsoft CoPilot for engineering to use and nobody touches it If NVDA invests more into AI models beside CUDA similar to OpenAI does, I think they will drive their value much higher.

They actually see their gaming cards as competition for their far higher margin datacentre cards. The inhouse chips, except for googles, have been quite disappointing so far. Most of them havent been costeffective as compared to nvidias cards even when taking into account nvidias margins, arent as easy to scale, and have no compilers or DL frameworks to use around them. Furthermore, in academics theres no such thing as a known dead end for decades. You cant ever definitively rule out an idea, and thats even more so the case when the eras differ in available compute by a factor of a billion. The claim that gpts cant achieve what you suggest is also fundamentally unproven. I think most ai engineers would agree that just next token prediction is not enough for jarvis, but thats been the consensus for years. However, this does not account for all the efforts put into posttraining like RLHF, and selfconsistency.

But GPT read and responded in 5seconds The critique youve provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AIs current trajectory and potential. 1. AI Approaches and Progress The critique dismisses the GPTML approach as a known dead end, but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While its true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fictionlike fantasies e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S., this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT3, GPT4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries. 2. Exponential Investment for Linear Gains The notion of exponential investment for linear gains is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of whats possible. 3. Business Case for AI The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an allencompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decisionmaking, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable. 4. Training Data and Resources Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resourceintensive nature of AI. 5. Nvidias Role While its true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust softwarehardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidias role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete. 6. Investor Expectations The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and longterm potential. In summary, while AIs development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a bubble fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock."

I think you take this a little hyperbolic in places e.g. ML does have real academic applications, including LLMs in select fields that deal with text data, and the whole Jarvis line is kinda ridic tbh but the core point of ballooning costs, fairly anemic use cases, manufacturing teething problems, and absurd current valuations is one I agree on. Its kind of like the Tesla story a couple years ago. Company hits scale in a new market, competition emerges and issues start to crop up, so theres a limit to growth upside. But valuations are assuming fairly substantial continued growth. So the upside is minimal and downside risks are elevated. Not something Id take a huge position on, but worth unwinding long positions and maybe a speculative put or two in a large enough portfolio."

You are also wrong about improvement costs being completely exponential. That is true for the scaling wide increasing parameter count and training time, but scaling vertically is much more efficient. I use the latest models every day for programming and it seems like every week theres something new that can solve some problems the previous model couldnt solve. The current state of the art is focused on improving training and making a corpus of training data have better results. The gains are spectacular. Microsofts Phi 3.5 mini came out last week and has 3.8B parameters. It outperforms Llama 2 70B from a year ago on benchmarks. Thats almost 20x less parameters and possibly training time. They did this by improving training methodology and making training data higher quality. So methodology is leading to huge improvements. Hyper scale companies are continuing to scale wide AND implement these methodologies. This means each generation is getting better and better and we have a while before we get to scraping the bottom of the barrel of the gains."

You can look up what folks like Sam Altman were saying 5 years ago. Here he is in 2019 openly saying they have no real path to profitability and once we make AI good enough itll just tell us how to make a return. A year ago the entire field was bristling with excitement about AGI and superintelligence, its a relatively recent development that theyve walked expectations back. Theyre just doing the fusion power is 5 years away thing. Heres Sam himself talking down GPT4 2 months before it came out and a couple months ago saying its mildly embarrassing at best and heres him saying largely the same thing nearly 6 years ago The current thing is always good enough for some tasks and the true AGI future is just a few years away. The issue isnt that it takes time, the issue is in 2020 when they released GPT3 theyd raised less than 100m, and today theyve raised over 13B, and they dont have a lot to show for that extra 12.9B. Sams talking about burning 50 billion a year to build AGI and its just got people wondering how many rounds well have to go on this before we get whats actually promised. At the end of the day its not his 50 billion to burn, his company isnt profitable so its gotta come from other people who arent going to keep ponying up if theres no progress to show for it. Obviously the AI sector is bigger than OpenAI, but theyre the best example. True AGI would be worth near infinite investment, but 400B for the current state of AI wasnt worth it, the longer this goes the more investors will just see it as throwing good money after bad."

Its been the best seelling EV truck of the year so far granted theyre just getting through the preorder backlog, but people are still completing their orders I have also been seeing them everywhere in person and also everyone around me is constantly mentioning it or talking about it. Positive things and negative, tbh mostly negative but imo no news is bad news the more people that hate on it the more people will eventually find it and like it, the haters dont realize theyre only contributing to its success. Everyone is making videos or talking about it constantly and you can look at any celebrity and they all seem to have one. self driving cars already exist with companies like Waymo, tesla is not far behind. Watch some videos of the newest version of their FSD and youll see how advanced it already is. It can gauge complex situations like accidents or animals running in the road and is often driving better than many humans I know. yes there are companies who are selling real robo taxi services right now one of which being waymo. But if you see the difference of what theyve completed compared to what Tesla is achieving you would be surprised. The current existing robo taxis have tens of thousands of dollars of sensors on them and are geofenced to small mapped out areas. Tesla is selling their vehicles for less than the sensors alone on those vehicles and teslas will eventually have nongeofences full self driving. The calculations are being done in real time by AI trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of real time driving footage from real people. Once completed a Tesla will be able to encounter any road, any situation, anywhere and solve it where as the other companies are focused on tiny areas just to get it working. Thats not to put down what theyve done or say it doesnt have its place but Tesla is aiming for something on a much greater scale and once completed will most likely take over the entire market."

Regardless of the speedbumps along the way, I see an eventual full transition to electric or at least 90 of vehicles on the road. Not to say we wont have major issues to deal with, I could also see the mandates getting rolled back in certain states. The goal of the electric car is to never have to think about charging it, eventually, everyone will change at home when they go to bed, so why would you want to go somewhere to fill up? The only time most people will be charging away from home will be over long distances which is what superchargers are for and eventually battery tech will improve, we already have comparable ranges to ICE vehicles. The new model 3 long range gets 363 which is more than my small Toyota. The 38 revenue from carbon credits is just from a recent quarter most likely because they have a backlog of them and this is a rough time for sales so they need to claim them in order to help prop up the business while theyre suffering. Tesla will survive long term. The vehicle sector of tesla is definetly the most prominent portion currently, but long term it will not be. That is why they market themselves as a technology company, they ened ot sell the cars to people first for them to want to purchase FSD eventually once it gets better. Having an EV will lead them down the road into Tesla energy by having battery walls installed or solar tiles on their roofs. The energy sector profits more than doubled last quarter for tesla, this is the beginning of the transition of profits into other sectors. Teslas are already cheap enough a new model 3 costs about the same as a toyota corolla, not to say 26k is cheap by any means. I definetly wouldnt buy one new but a lot of people would the F150 is the most popular vehicle in america and costs 45k. People will be happy to switch once they learn about the benefits, right now there is a lot of boomer hate against sustainable things and EVs and that will change as the young generations take over and become wealthy and settled into thei rjobs and can make the transition. In 20 years kids wont believe that cars used to run on gas and didnt drive themsleves."

Often when companies go out, their entities dont get fully absorbed in a lot of western companies. China is different. Its a literal snowball of smaller, mid sized, large companies consolidated under covid economic crisis thats ready to go balls fucking deep. So unless TSLA can maintain its previous cult like following which they are losing with elons downright far right views, idk if they can survive. The competition will get stronger and stronger and tsla will not be able to have that big of a market space in the end. Plus people dont buy cars for 1020 years now. A lot of people switch cars every 37 years. Why would anyone pay 6080k for a car when they can pay way less if the quality keeps up. Seriously check bydnio lol crushing in the rest of the world."

I agree they have the potential to take away market share from tesla but Im doubtful on how much. Right now Tesla already has dominance in the US EV sector so it will be tough for the Chinese cars to break into the market at first, if they can even get here. Most US politics are against giving too much power to the Chinese and I think part of why Elon is being friendly with trump is because he is betting on him tarifing the shit out of those Chinese EVs so theyre more expensive than Teslas. I agree with competition will get stronger stronger no doubt, supposedly BMW even surpassed Teslas quartet EV sales in Europe recently. But nobody in the sector is as diversified as Tesla, cars is just one aspect of their long term game plan and theyre already dominating. Also nobody else is working on self driving like they are which will be a huge game changer once completed. Why would you buy a cheap Chinese EV once Tesla is the only true self driving, or why would you buy a car at all if you can order a Tesla to drive you to work for a fraction of what an uber would cost? The teslas are getting cheaper and cheaper, right now you can buy a Tesla model 3 for 26k after rebates, thats getting as cheap a Toyota Corolla, which has nowhere near the tech features. Think of apple, how many companies have better devices than them with better features and cheaper? And still iPhone is the most sold smartphone in the us, its not always about being the best its about knowing your consumer and how to appeal. I know several people who extreme liberals and absolutely hate Elon and everything about him and even they own teslas and admit there is nothing else on the market like them"

The promises I am saying he has kept are the ones related to his pay package, he declared he would not take a salary in 2018 and instead he wanted a 1 stock option ability to purchase shares at a lower rate if he could take the market cap of tesla from 50 billion to 650billion and he did it and took it to over a trillion and even now after beaten down its still sitting at 800billion market cap. Why would he do that if he didnt believe in the company and its ability to grow, why would he take more stock options instead of just straight cash if he knew the company was going to fail? The earnings call that I listened to as well seemed to be very straightforward and he was clear to not make promises he cant keep, he even admitted on the most recent earnings call that he was wrong about when FSD would be completed and he didnt want to give an exact date because he doesnt know.

No other company is operating at their level and has done as much as they have. TSLA is going to be worth whatever people are willing to pay for it in the end.

I dont know what the nearterm future holds but I believe in the company and want to share my ideas. I appreciate the criticism. I still disagree that he is a con man, I guess we have to agree to disagree.

The contract with Telesat was 198 satellites for 2.1B and they have another unnamed contract that should be announced soon for 750M. 400 satellites a year could potentially bring in 4B year on the high end not counting their robotics segments, future expansion etc. Overall, I think theyre pretty undervalued, but by using judgment on current market conditions, Im going to hold some cash to be able to take advantage of a random sell off"
