But in the short term, even with great news, a number of investors seem to just st themselves because God forbid, the lottery win didnt happen, just seems overly ridiculous, or am I missing something?"

This time is different and SoFi is retaining the great majority of the gain from the past month. I wont be surprise if SoFi gets above preannouncement Mondays closing price of 11.19 by Wednesday.

From my perspective, its conservative mgmt that has always beat and raised and outpaced analyst expectations theyve also called out in regards to 26 guidance that it didnt incorporate any new products which theyve had new launches since this guidance was released and will inevitably have more. I also personally disagree that a high growth fintech should be valued as a legacy bank most of which have sub 10 rev growth. If their tech platform really accelerates and gets deals with large financial institutions itll be hard to ignore its part of the valuation delta vs banks. Theyve also leaned into originating for other companies no capital loan origination and loan servicing revenue where they dont take on risk. Its possible that growth completely stagnates in 27 but I dont think itll be that mature of company by then. Right now massive tailwinds for company with interest rate cuts, regulatory changes driving demand for tech platform, significant demand for loans for higher income individuals which is Sofia bread and butter. Im extremely bullish over next year , not necessarily beyond that as there wont be as much comparative tailwinds."

On the other hand, almost every bank even ops bank, I bet will let you withdraw your entire account as cash if you give them a day or two headsup. Its simply the reality of modern banking that most branches dont have a Scrooge McDucksized vault filled with 100 bills. You need to give them fair warning so that they can order the cash to be delivered for you a day or two later. Even if they did have the cash you need, they still need to be able to service all the other customers who come throughout the day, so they can just give you all the cash they have in the vault."

They were above 50 through 2023. Through 2024, their CAGR looks like itll be dropping to around 38. If they maintain a similar unit sales volume in 2025, itll drop to 30. Not good. Tesla has a forward PE of over 72 right now, which will be even higher tomorrow. Other OEMs, who have performed far better than Tesla recently, are sitting around forward PEs of 57. Teslas valuation heavily relies on the idea of constant future growth. Their robotaxi event was generally scoffed at. Not good. It was fairly expected theyd beat estimates, and given how shit the stock has been lately, that often leads to a short term pump. I could see a 61.8 retracement by the end of the month from wherever its high is over the next 12 days probably right around 240, dropping to 222. Then I imagine itll pop back up to a lower high around 250255. Then, its likely all down from there, likely back down to around the 160175 area by beginning of next year... lining up with quarterly sales figures which I dont expect to be spectacular. Maybe it beats last year, but that isnt saying much when they were previously claiming a 50 CAGR. Why this stock is worth so much more than other auto OEMs is probably a question a lot of major investors are asking themselves. A lot of them were betting on autonomous taxis... but Musk can only claim its 12 years away for so long before they eventually start to wise up. 10 years... hes been claiming that every year for 10 years straight now The stocks a dog, Meme investors just dont know it yet. Its been in a long term downward trend, no doubt supported by a core of buy and hold forever insiders and cultists, and of course SP index funds that will only sell if everyone else does. Hell, GM is outperforming it... _________ Imagine where this company would be if they werent pulling in 10 billion in government subsidies and regulatory credit sales every year..."

But then the past 2 years its been a top performer and Im back up 200 since buying in while SPY is up 90. Point being that the best time to buy Meta was when it was down and they were going through struggles. Same with Netflix. Same with Amazon. Same with Palantir. Same with Crowdstrike earlier this year. Its literally just the same thing over and over again. Buy financially sound companies when theyre down and you will do well.

Comparing the first 3 quarters of the year, their regulatory income is approximately 700 million higher than the previous highest year. Theyve pulled in about 1.7 1.8 billion in regulatory income in each of the last two years. Theyre on course to pull in 2.5 billion in regulatory income in 2024. Its a pretty massive chunk of their total net income for having to do absolutely nothing to get it save sell the cars they were going to sell anyways. Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus 7.069 billion last year, or 32 lower yy. Remove the 700 million extra in regulatory credits yy, and it would have been closer to 4.1 billion or a 42 drop in income yy on their actual product sales. Theyre on course to just about match their total unit vehicle sales yy theyre still a bit behind last year through Q3. The problem is that their long term guidance which helped lead to the run up overvaluation in the stock price is 50 CAGR between 2020 and 2030. They rescinded that guidance in Q3 23 because they dont believe its possible anymore. To stay even with the 50 CAGR in 2024, theyd have need to sell over 2.5 million vehicles, but theyre on course to sell about 1.8 million. 2025 could see little if any sales growth versus 20232024. However, to maintain the 50 CAGR in 2025, theyd have to hit 3.8 million vehicle sales. Starting to see the problem? Their forward PE is based on crazy growth guidance, which even Tesla has admitted they cant hit, yet the stock is still trading at a forward PE of over 80. Most of the major OEMs across the world trade a forward PE of between 5 and 7. Teslas sales arent growing, their revenue isnt growing, and their income isnt growing, which means their PE is based on nothing more than a hope and a dream. It seems to me that for the second year in a row, Tesla will only see an annual profit on account of government subsidies and regulatory credit sales."

In Q3, regulatory credit sales accounted for 34 of their total net income. Tesla once again lives on subsidies, whether theyre paid by the government, or other OEMs are forced to pay them to Tesla through regulations... which essentially points out just how excessively Teslas vehicles are subsidized. 7500 federal tax credit 1500 5000 state tax credit Hard to say how much theyre getting from EV regulatory credit sales per Tesla sold, but my guess would be around 2000 per vehicle. Add it all up, and Tesla could be getting subsidized on 25 of the total sale price of their vehicles. EV tax credits benefit Tesla in that Tesla can raise their MSRPs to offset the value of the tax credit, thus taking an equivalent amount of revenue profit"

Being the top share of a mere 5.4 of global sales 2023 BEV sales, I dont count hybrids as EVs isnt that big of a fraction of the global automobile market. The question is, will Tesla still be the leader or at least a strong 2nd place when EVs are 98 of the market. There will always be hobbyist and specialty use ICE vehicles, so itll never be 100 but it should be close. If you dont believe EVs are the primary future of passenger vehicles, you probably shouldnt be in Tesla in the first place, but there are hydrogen believers. Still. FWIW, I think its a strong probabilty that they will be. China is the only real concern, I dont see any serious challenge to Tesla dominance coming from anywhere else. On the other hand, China is doing well, and a governmentbacked Chinese company has ... not quite unlimited funding for expansion, but ... a lot. There is a real risk though that Tesla is regulated into failure in the US and Europe as political revenge for Elons activities, Teslas antiunion position, or both. If not actually shutting Tesla down with red tape, then subsidizing some competition that otherwise wouldnt be a viable threat. There has also always been a real risk that Elon says something intemperate that wrecks the China relationship China has a history anyway of letting foreign companies in to learn their technology before regulating them out or subsidizing the locals enough to push out the foreigners. It didnt happen that way to Apple and may not happen that way to Tesla if they also export enough Chinesemade product to be a net benefit for the Chinese... theres reason to be hopeful. Provided that Elon doesnt retweet any Winnie the Pooh memes, of course. Anyway, Im not selling my TSLA position, and odds are IMO reasonable, but it would be a mistake to think that dominating the emerging market in any way guarantees dominating the mature market."

If Teslas AI efforts fail, the PE will collapse. Ive projected that Tesla is only worth 6070share based on vehicle energy systems alone, which is a downside of around 7075 from todays market cap Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus 7.069 billion last year, or 32 lower yy. Remove the 700 million extra in regulatory credits yy, and it would have been closer to 4.1 billion or a 42 drop in income yy on their actual product sales. Are you willing add back in the 622 million in onetime restructuring charges from last quarter as well? Some factors will be transitory. It is odd that people are arguing against the regulatory credits counting towards anything, given the small size but consistent presence.

Palantir has never had a PE anywhere near 20 in their existence, and it was at a forward PE of 200 when they were struggling Crowdstrike has never had a PE anywhere near 20 and had a PE of 300 when they were struggling and dropping earlier this year. For all of my examples to have a PE below 20 its odd how most of them dont. Edit, because rereading your comment Im getting more lost Its not the same thing over and over. Cisco, blackberry, and IBM were all financially sound yet their stock prices never recovered. IBM is literally at all time highs so I dont have a clue what youre referencing there.

We really dont know what long term environmental impact the mining sites for the battery materials are having though, or what frontloading a high load of emissions is having, such as the difference in manufacturing a BEV w a large battery, versus manufacturing an ICEV Hybrid PHEV. Sure, traditional OEMs dont have to report the billions in from environmental damage, however, Teslas vehicles dont all run on 100 renewable energy, so they too benefit from not paying for environmental damage caused by the electricity production their cars use to move. Im all about carbon taxes and taxes on practices that damage the environment to level the playing field, and preferably to move more people way from owning driving personal vehicles so much. Its the only fair way to go about it IMO. Key is that a carbon tax would actually give a huge benefit to people who ride public transit, ride bikes and PEVs, work from home, or in those workers at businesses that implement 4 day work weeks. Something the EV subsidy programs arent doing. Plus, carbon environmental taxes impact all facets of life, not just transportation. From the amount of electricity we use at home, the amount of hot water we use, the foods we eat, the things we buy, etc... The government is spending a LOT of money on a solution thats doing far too little. The regulatory credit policies are, IMO, not having the impact they were intended to have. Their primary result has been to build cash in Teslas coffers and make Elon Musk the richest man on the planet, and starve other initiatives of much needed capital. Hell, we could have spent the 30 billion in subsidies that went to Tesla painting bike lanes and had a much larger environmental impact."

It does beg the question though, how can a project with an endless timeline ever truly fail? Afterall, FSD has been claimed to be 12 years away from completion for 10 straight years now. Millions of Robotaxis were going to hit the roads in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and now 2025... If they fail 2025, itll be 2026, then 2027. Meanwhile, other real services are already operating, so investors claim of Tesla instantly enabling robotaxis and quickly gaining a monopoly on not just autonomous taxi services, but all taxi services, instantly wiping out millions of taxi driver jobs...is a bit far fetched. The more we really consider the complexities, the more unrealistic it sounds. Hell, Musk is now saying that 2025 will only see robotaxis in some regions of Texas and California... not the nationwide rollout he originally claimed with a simple OTA update. Then of course theres the hardware concerns... now the claim is HW3 may not actually be able to operate the software. New cars are on HW4... and now Musk is claiming an HW5 is coming thats well beyond enough power to operate a robotaxi... the same thing he said about HW4... How about those robots though... those look anywhere close to ready to anyone? I mean, they were talking to people at robotaxi day... even if it was a human talking through a speaker... Why would I add back in 622 million in restructuring? Did they not benefit this quarter and part of last by not having to pay wages to all the people they laid off? They laid people off because their demand wasnt where they needed it to be, and had they kept those people on staff, Teslas financials would have been in far worse shape right now. As Ive mentioned in my comments, 740 million in net profits from regulatory credit income on a total net income of 2.2 million isnt a small size. It accounts for 33.5 of their total quarterly profit. And thats just the regulatory carbon credits... it doesnt include federal state EV tax credits, solar tax credits, battery storage tax credits, tax abatements, etc..."

Keep in mind, a massive chunk of their remaining net income comes from government subsidies. In the US for example, theyre still seeing 7500 federal tax credits on a large percentage of their total sales which allows them to maintain higher MSRPs, translating into higher profit margins. Most of their sales are in states with state EV tax credits as well, often in the 15002500 range. Some as high as 5000. Their energy sales are even more subsidized than their car sales. The federal government subsidizes something like 30 of the overall cost of a solar panel home battery storage installation. States with the highest rooftop solar adoption rates often have additional incentives on top. Overall, it can reach up to 50. Im not sure on their grid scale power storage, but Im guessing the subsidies andor the amount theyre charging the government, which often has mandates written into law to have storage installed, are lucrative. Like 2023... if Tesla were to exclude regulatory credit income and government subsidies from their income, theyd likely be reporting a loss for 2024. I guess this doesnt technically matter unless there were a risk that the subsidies were going to disappear in short order.. which theres no sign of. Some headwinds for Q4 Theyve removed their lowest priced trim model 3 near the end of Q3, which had the imported Chinese LFP battery. That could hit their overall sales numbers in Q4. It also means theyre not going to sell cars with the significantly cheaper LFP packs, which likely generated some decent profit margins. These units didnt qualify for the full tax credit on sales although I do believe they still qualified on leases, which Tesla would have had to roll into the lease price. Not sure if they did or didnt do that. They significantly cut the price of the Cybertruck and still dont seem to have a backlog after the price cut per their estimated delivery dates on their site. Theyve significantly cut the prices on their inventory vehicles. Model 3s Ive seen have up to 3k discounts applied. Model Y has as much as 4k discounts applied. Model Y accounts for the majority of their sales. That said, they were also aggressively discounting inventory vehicles last year in Q4. Theyre offering 0 financing offers which I believe is new this year. While this wont impact their unit sales, it will mean additional losses of up to 5k per vehicle over the course of the loan that they otherwise would have made on interest. I do expect Tesla to break their sales numbers from last year, if only because theyre so deeply discounting their vehicles. However, I expect their revenue and net income to be down in Q4 yy as a result of their deep discounting."

However they dont seen to interested in that. Musk let it slip on the call there new 30k vehicle in development is actually 30k post credits which means its basically a grand or two cheaper then the 3 is now. Also as I said earlier their marketing strategy seems to be to promise a low cost model at announcement, but cut it before production."

While the IBM case is more complex they survived the PC era thanks to their mainframe business and supplying PowerPC for Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony game consoles, and lately Quantum Computing has made them to be relevant again, whoever invested in them and kept it during this time, in the end they have been rewarded. And looking at the graph now, from an ATH of 200 they went down to 100 in 2020 and they are now at 230. Not too bad. And considering they are one of the most important actors in quantum computing, they will probably continue growing at a good pace. Blackberry is a completely different story. It is true that before the turndown, no one saw it coming. Essentially, no one saw the iPhone coming. Once the iPhone was out, it was clear from the first day that it was a gamechanger. Every possible actor had to react very quickly or die sooner or later. The most evident victims were Nokia and BB. Google was able to react quickly by removing the keyboard from Android. The first versions did not support virtual keyboards I guess everyone remembers Steve Ballmer laughing at a phone that cost 500 and didnt even have a keyboard. It took them a few years to move to Android, and by then, it was way too late. I didnt have any shares on BB back then, but I would have dumped them shortly after seeing that the only BB business model was no longer relevant and that they were not reacting to the changes. With Tesla, although it is clear they will not keep growing the way they did before, it seems unlikely that today they will follow the path BB took. Together with the Chinese EV manufacturers, they are the reference right now. And Tesla has other businesses besides the cars that make them relevant. The influence of Musk is another story, though."

There are certainly unknowns that are never mentioned or covered, which is why I mention those things out in my comments. For example, I didnt say increased cost of battery production. I specifically noted the high front loading of high emissions. Why did I mention this? The planet can only sequester so much carbon over a given period. What happens if we significantly increase the amount of carbon we produce in a given year on account of a manufacturing process that spikes the levels of emissions? What are the impacts to the environment? Does it result in more ocean acidification, because the CO2 is sucked up by the oceans instead of the forests? Thus leading to devastation of coral reefs and oceanic plant life, and styming the Oceans ability to sequester more carbon? Again, not something covered in cradle to grave assessments.. Sure, power grids are changing... slowly... and will continue to do so over time. That doesnt mean there arent significantly better solutions to the environmental problem than simply MOAR CARS!. Were to the point where every bit of CO2 we inject into the atmosphere will likely require more energy and time to suck back out of the atmosphere in the future with CO2 sequestration processes. IMO, the best solution is to not emit in the first place. We, humans, need to drastically reduce our carbon footprints in a very short period of time. BEVs help, never said they dont. Dollar for impact... theyre about the slowest solution for reducing global emissions."

Structurally unprofitable was what the vast majority of financial experts were saying. Except we know that it didnt end well for those betting against the stock A UBS financial advisor in Madison, Wisconsin who oversees a 35person team repeatedly promoted the idea of short selling shares of the electric car company Tesla, Inc., triggering more than 23 million in losses for four couplesall members of an extended familyand another investor, according to an arbitration claim filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. His recommendation focused on his conviction that lots of money would be made because Tesla common stock was overvalued and certain to lose its value, the plaintiffs argued. No balanced view of the risk of loss was provided by Burish. It is extraordinarily reckless to reach such conclusions with absolute certainty. The people who are so sure they cant lose are the ones who get wiped out. That goes for the ultra bulls too. Plenty of TSLA shareholders got wiped out by margin calls when Elon Musk repeatedly betrayed and stabbed them in the back with openmarket share dumps in late 2022. He kept lying saying he was done selling TSLA stock to fund the Twitter buyout, only to keep selling TSLA stock over and over, driving the price from over 400 to near 100. You think you cant lose.

Teslas also recently lowered prices or at least no longer requires an expensive package which consists of software and whats essentially a few cheap pieces of plasticmetal, and its pretty clear from their order page that theres no backlog remaining for this vehicle. At least, not at these prices. We also know that CT sales seem to be cannibalizing model SX sales... or maybe SX customers are just going the way of the dodo, and new buyers came in to buy the CT. Maybe a mix of both. Either way, theyre trading two high cost potentially high margin vehicles for one. Cars still make up the lions share of their revenue. Both divisions rely on large orders of cells. One cant exist without the other. If car sales slow down, Tesla offloads excess cells through their energy division. It just so happens that their energy products are subsidized to a much larger percentage than their vehicles. How large the overall market is for their energy products is anyones guess. Frankly, Liion isnt exactly the most cost effective way for storing energy in a static location. Solar roof seems to generally be a failure of a product. Ironically, their powerwall sales would likely be far lower if they actually allowed V2L capabilities in their nonCT vehicles. Its a a conflict of interest for them to enable V2L capabilities in their vehicles, which is kind of silly when you think about it. Theyre screwing the customer intentionally to pad their own pocketbooks. I imagine Other revenue may have been FSD. Remember that near the end of the quarter, Tesla started offering 0 financing, but only if you bought FSD. It essentially made FSD cost like 1k or something after all was said and done. Early in Q4 now... Teslas removed that requirement and is now just offering 0 financing on their model 3 and Y with no need to buy FSD. Theyre also discounting their model 3 Y inventory by 2k 4k. Not listening to the earnings call so dont know what hes saying about their forecast, but I doubt it... Without a new lower priced model, or deeply discounting their existing models, their market isnt large enough. We dont know where the economy will be next year, but it could certainly worsen. It seems calls for a recession arent as large as they have been, but I can certainly see some economic troubles. Growing credit card debt, credit card defaults, and auto loan defaults dont just magically go away. The real question is where will this magic increase in volume come from? 30 volume growth is an additional 540,000 vehicles produced and sold. They have no new factories under construction AFAIK. I cant see CT sales volumes growing much without significant price cuts, and I definitely dont think theyll be selling over 100k of them next year. Much like the F150L, I think there was the initial pent up demand, but once its out, its going to be a long slog to growth in that sector. Also, where are they planning to grow their sales? The US? Europe? China? Im guessing China, where they very well may be expanding havent heard much news on that front lately. However, if theyre expanding, theyre expanding at a time when all of the Chinese OEMs are also rapidly expanding. Somehow I dont think Teslas market will grow by 440k units in China in one year. Although... I mean China just enabled their government to buy Tesla vehicles... the first foreign brand theyve ever enabled that for. China also seems to be abnormally beholden to Tesla for some reason."

People dont understand because theyre soooo used to inflation and cost of living that debt just seems normal. Theyre not understand bitcoin in terms of its supply and whats available supply wise and for the future. This is a shifting dynamic and people need to ask themselves why instituional investors such as blackrock. Was so Anti btc. Same as saylor have done a u turn. For everyone calling bitcoin a scam, likewise banks too, theyre all now suffering with bank runs etc. Meanwhile BTC is breaking ATHs Either become a btcmstr maxi. Or just live your life getting wrecked by the magical money printing that governments do. Peoples comments make me laugh. Call bitcoin a scam when it was at 15,000 then bash it when it outpaces normal stocks and gets back to ATH. It really cant win always gunna have people bad mouthing it. If MSTR was to drop tomorrow 5090 I would be buying with every fiber in my body. I honestly dont give a shit what software they make or whatever.

If it continues at this rate in 4 years the amount of Bitcoin it holds per share doubles. In 10 years BTC per share is 6x higher. If this happens owning MicroStrategy will give a shareholder more bitcoin than if they just bought a ETF. This is the chance holders are taking. So they are basically taking on low interest debt and buying bitcoin giving them leverage to the price of bitcoin in both directions. Many institutions that are limited to only investing in bonds want to lend money to MicroStrategy because it offers much better returns than government bonds or any other bonds. The other thing to remember is they have a software business that is working on developing bitcoin applications and have a goal of becoming a bank as well. So the premium to net asset value also reflects the chance that any of these ventures will be profitable, much like how many magnificent 7 companies are worth 3050x times current earnings in a year. If inflation continues to accelerate and BTC continues its trend over the past 15 years MSTR will possibly be the largest company in the world in 1020 years. If bitcoin stagnates for longer than a 4 year period they could go bankrupt. If BTC starts doing 10 a year average and doesnt have any explosive years like in the past MSTR might do ok but a Bitcoin ETF would likely out preform it. This is the chance investors are taking."

Im going to quote one of their engineers Chad Wahlquist explaining why you need an Ontology core moat to scale LLMs within your business context As we scale stochastic unpredictable LLMs to power more dynamic and useful workflows, we enter a new domain of decisions and actions. You now need humans and AI to work together as a team, with more controls over whowhatwhenwherewhy actions can be taken. It is no longer a clear line between humans or systems. The Ontology acts as the substrate for simulating, orchestrating, controlling, and reviewing decisions in a world where HumansAI work together. LLMs bring new reasoning capabilities, which is amazing but also dangerous see all the public oops moments already from just deploying an LLM. True value is created when the loop is closed, the action is taken, and the Ontology provides the scalable framework to do so. Your business is a system of systems that is getting more complex by the day. You cannot merely shoehorn an LLM into the mix and expect your existing endtoend architecture to support quality decisionmaking with HumansAI. The Ontology acts as the fabric across your business, orchestrating the data, logic, actions and security of your operations, systems, and people to power entirely new capabilities that HumanAI teaming can bring. Visual The Ontology allows you to move past the window dressing that is Copilot and others like it because it enables the LLM to both understand your business logic and write back to your core applications. What does this look like in the real world? Shyam Sankar CTO recently went on CNBC and talked about how one of their large US insurance clients automated all of their underwriting using 78 AI agents. A process that use to take 2 weeks now takes 3 hours. If all of your competitors take 2 weeks to price risk, and you take 3 hours, its going to be a fundamental dislocation of the market.

Now were well into the second year of everybody trying to fit LLMs into any business application while struggling to solve the hallucination problem, which is not a problem to be solved but rather a technological feature that wont go away. You dump a load of data and expect that a statistical model with a random seed will generate consistent output. Then you waste more time applying optimization techniques that will never solve that problem fully. LLMs are great for controlled translation original propose and text reformulation and summarization which is tangential to translation. They might be good at software code conversion too also a translation application, but not so much at generating new code reliably though. They cant generate text about subject matters that werent incorporated into their training. They cant talk about anything that hasnt been spoken yet. Essentially a parrot as far as new content generation is concerned. Nobody has come up any killer application for LLMs so far.

As I said, LLMs are great, but its not the killer tech the Sam Altmans out there want us to believe it is. I dont think it will replace call center people, for example, or software devs, or writers and artists. It might replace Google Search and other web search engines.

The company I work for used to own Talen energy mentioned in this article the reason it was sold off is because it was just dead weight back then. Perfect example...at the Susquehanna plant mentioned, we had to keep two fleets of excavators on hand in case of a meltdown and pay for upkeep, maintenance, etc... It was literally redundancy for a black swan event, wild. This is the reason that Exelon has basically been the name in the game in nuke generation in the US. My old boss used to head up exelons nuke operations the only way they were able to make it profitable was through acquisition and absolutely ruthless standardization...they acquired a new plant and would implement the playbook...execsemployees who pushed back were gone. Same service intervals, same vendors for IT systems, same schemes, same excavator, same everything across the entire fleet. My company, as many others have long said nuke is the answer...with reasonable regulation. SMR and the involvement of big tech is bringing that conversation to the forefront. Nuke and nuke adjacent industries like utilities are great play at the moment. Same with NG, but thats a whole other discussion."

A lot of people are NIMBYs when it comes to nuclear energy, its great to have the energy it produces, but not to have a nuclear plant in their backyard where theyd suffer the fallout of another Chernobyl. On top of that, the fact is the more you engage in a risky activity the greater the odds of something bad happening from said activity even if the odds are really really low. i.e. the average driver could correctly boast having a 100 safety record, but obviously youd rightly laugh in their face if they insisted that means theres zero chance that theyll ever get into a car accident. Even if you have a bunch of very safe drivers on the road, the more very safe drivers you have on the road the greater the odds that one of those very safe drivers will get into an accident, it happens every day because theres millions of them on the road. That above paragraph isnt fear mongering about nuclear energy, its statistical odds."

I think he was looking at the Board of OKLO at the time and hearing rumblings of these small reactors to power AI data centers and thought it could be a good play. There was definitely luck involved in the 40 pop in a day, but I think he was looking at it as a play for the ancillary businesses to AI, like selling the pick axes and shovels.

Its not just the Wests operational practices that have made nuclear energy so safe here. Its that reactor facilities have been designed with passive safety in mind to prevent operator error from ever causing a disaster, and the next generation nuclear technology takes that to another level. Its like saying cars in the 50s were so dangerous because even minor accidents could kill or cause severe injury, so people just shouldnt drive.

                    "text": "Kind of disagree. The consumer is sick of the Starbucks ripoff. Theyre looking for value, not sweet drinks that cost as much as a meal. Id been skeptical that just tweaks could fix that. I do believe making some big and fundamental and newsgenerating changes could fix Starbucks business. I also believe the small tweaks wont do anything. Seeing that 4 point letter from Niccol screams tweaks not true fundamental change. Its as much BS corpospeak as what Laxman was putting out. Empower the barista. Please. Ive read the employeedominated sub, and the theme is theyre sick of being worked to death and it sounds like many dont even like the customers. Understand the market isnt exactly a forensic fix for China. Customers tired of being ripped off dont need to be told the Starbucks story. The name on cups gag is played out. Making Starbucks a community coffeehouse isnt really what consumers want, and isnt necessarily good for the business. They want better value and they want to get in and out quickly. The 25 pop was the market assuming Niccol could make the inandout quickly thing, and the perceived value thing happen. This letter sounds like he doesnt even understand the problem. And the market annointing him as universal problem solving saint may be misguided. Yes, CMG stock had incredible growth and the brand became widely loved... for the first half of his tenure. But the second half is not as pretty. When problems started to appear, he seemed incapable of identifying and addressing them proactively. Chipotle is now widely perceived as being a ripoff and too bland. Bad portion sizes. Skimping on ingredients and quality. He seemed paralyzed and clueless about that. His last big public appearance before abandoning the ship was him goofily claiming the portions were consistent, as big as your head, and that if you ever felt you werent getting value, you should personally try to shame the worker into topping up your plate. Thats out of touch, not problem solving. So a perhaps more sober assessment of Niccol is that he was present while CMG rode the advantage of the stock being pummeled from killing customers with unsafe food, and then when the time came to actually solve problems, he couldnt recognize them let alone solve them. And now hes the one walking into a problemfest at Starbucks. I took my 24 gains and am waiting to see what happens. If I were given that job, instead of issuing that bad, pithy letter, heres what Id do acknowledge the deep problems which are a consumer no longer willing to pay luxury price for sugary milkshakes, employees placed in unfulfilling situations, operational inability to have quick, high volume output. fixes would be in the form of Big Bang changes and candid humility. Look to the dominos model where they apologized and acknowledged cardboard level pizza. Fix the bad, burnt coffee taste perception. look also to McDonalds who knows you have to keep volume going even when consumers are strapped and sick of you, and they do that with inarguably value through literal value menus. Id have some newsgenerating low priced options as a form of Starbucks value menu look also to McDonalds who figured out how to massively pump out drive through where your order is prepared in the time it takes between ordering and paying and pickup window, and then making that parallel with two or more lanes. Id overhaul the operations substantially. Despite what coffeehouse baristas think, efficient machines can make most of a drink just fine. Weve all had delicious mass produced smoothies, Nespressos, etc. Id lean heavy on such automation and preparation to massively ramp up how much and how quickly a location can pump out the drinks, and let the baristas be more of a presentation element. Let them use their time and personalities with the customers instead of tamping away and washing seives in the back. Yes, Id be fine with a scenario where premade or machine made drinks are pumped out under a counter and a charming baritas focus on pretending they made it and making the customer feel happy and that theyve been served quickly. Make it globally known that the long lineups are over and that you can get a plain coffee for 3 from the value menu. this would address both the biggest consumer deterrents plus make life liveable for the baristas. it turns Starbucks back into a perceived affordable treat, an attainable piece of luxury at a good price. Theres more, but you get the point. Sure, theres a halo on Niccol, and a whole ecosystem of Wall Street and financial news media that is invested in claiming Starbucks is great regardless of the truth. But in terms of actual transformational change, my plan seems to have more substance than tell the Starbucks story"

The larger the loss youre willing to accept, the larger your trail value should be. If youre using a trailing stop loss, look at the daily trading history of the stock be sure to look at days that are just bad days for the stock market generally. Set your trailing stop loss to be more than the max loss you could expect to see in a single day, but less than a free fall drop that could happen after bad news. 10 is a good starting point. On a final note, I am much tighter with my trail amounts in my tax advantaged IRA accounts, because I dont give a shit if the sell order triggers. I can just buy the stock the next day at a discount and not have to worry about long vs short cap gains. It is exceedingly rare that a stock could drop 10 and trigger a stop loss and then jump back positive in the same day. If it hits 10 in one day chances are it will go even lower before it goes back up."

Maybe because its early, but Im not getting why now if youve always been disappointed. Youre buying just the largest caps internationally, but given the nature of the names you mentioned, one or more were probably a part of the international ETFs you were disappointed in. People have talked up a bounce in international names given relative valuations for years, but aside from specific stories MELI, to use an example, EMinternational DMs have largely underperformed US for a long time including at the large cap level. I think there are great specific stories in Europe, Asia, Latin America and own some of them a lot of them smallmid caps but I have no interest in owning international fundsindexes broadly. Say you have 10k to invest, you would buy 4400 of Saudi Aramco, 2030 of Taiwan Semiconductors, 1310 of Novo Nordisk, 1290 of Tencent 1290, and 970 of Louie Vuitton It feels like buying the largest companies for the sake of buying the largest companies. Which could wind up working out fine, but I just think if youre buying an individual company, its good to consider why this specificallyis this a good time to buyetc. Looks like one issure is many of these companies are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which I cant buy as a Canadian Not sure if Canadians can buy US ADRs somehow, or GDRs in other countries that have decent enough volumeliquidity. also is there a way to backtest this strategy You can backtest a portfolio to a limited degree at but I dont know of a place you can backtest a broader strategy."

Acquire stake in AI startup contingent on them buying Nvidia products, those sales get recorded as revenue for nvidia, and the cash they spend on acquisition also shows on balance sheet. Net effect shows net growth and profit, when in reality all they did is give cash to a company to buy their own products. The problem is after a few years, as the GPUs get depreciated, that gets passed on as an equity method lossor goodwill impairment in the case of full acquisitions and begins to show on Nvidias earnings. But Nvidia can hide this in the short term by growing the rate that they close new deals. Ultimately, it will depend on the success of these AI startups. If they actually become profitable and produce good return on invested capitalROIC, then these companies doing round tripping could perform well. But if they fail, then big tech will take a hit too. Secondly, big tech companies are developing their own AI chips now so that they dont have to keep paying the insane markups on Nvidia chips, which are sold at double digit multiples of their production costs.

At the end of the day, the court of public opinion doesnt really matter except in the case of regulation antitrust. What actually matters is where people vote with their wallets. Its clear to see that people dont care about data privacy issues that much given Facebook has over 3 billion monthly active users. Sure there are health concerns around products KO produces, but theyre at record sales so I guess the vote is in there too. So on and so forth...

Ive only been doing this since April 2023, but it has outperformed the SP500 at 68 vs. 37 in the same time period. Given some time, we will see whether it remains a good strategy or not I got lucky with NVDA and a few others but I do legitimately believe that companies people enjoy working for have better odds of popping off.

More benevolent companies actively mitigate for the consequences and externalities of their actions. Sometimes it helps the bottom line in the long run, sometimes it doesnt. Some companies dont try to push legislation which helps the bottom line at the expense of everyone else. That said, companies pushing stronger standards which superficially help consumers are often doing it because they are structured better to benefit from those standards than their competitors e.g. legal compliance PR groups that enjoy economies of scale. The bar is pretty low in many industries, but retailers like Costco have a better than average reputation for treating workers decently and for providing decent valuequality to customers, for instance. Its impossible to please everyone, but If a company is performing decently, gets some positive press, has good brand loyalty, and doesnt get consistently complained about, and isnt causing willful or negligent harms, thats a pretty good reputation on the whole, IMO."

Instead of bringing back the quality they once had, LULU reduced their warranty from lifetime to one year. People who pay that much for a pair of yoga pants absolutely notice these things and shop elsewhere and let everyone else know as well.

He has very good knowledge of internal processes and how fast Intel can get bloated, its not the first time in this companys history. The bigger problem was once Pat came into play he was not focused on efficiency but solving the current issues with brute force. Meaning throwing as much money and people at it as possible. The issue that came into play that he slightly miscalculated how far Intel was actually behind. His famous philosophy back then was that by each generational cycle the competition came out Intel already offers 2. We can really see this in the current roadmap were Intel comes out with new products in way under 12 months in each space. When AMD and TSMC doesnt get their act together Intel will leapfrog them in 2025. This isnt the first time Intel has done this in its history. The issue now is that Intel is a long term play and in a currently not favorable position. Wall Street does not like that. They want fast money, fast quarterly results and dont care about anything else really. Now with the recent news about activist investors iam quite sure this news is fabricated by activist investors who manipulate the media in the background to gain shareholders favor. Dont fall for it. Intel wants to protect themselves from activist investors because they would try to split the company apart for the short term gain. If they would enter Intel is done. I really hope Pat will live long enough to see how what incredible work he has done. In 2025 we will see a very competitive Intel and in 2026 current Wallstreet critics will be very very silent. Just remember the fights Jensen had with Wallstreet back then. Now they love him."

This is what caused them to lose their market position. This was the result of bean counters hoping the cheaper process would be good enough, but while it worked the yield rates were too low causing it to become uneconomically viable and forcing intel to not shrink their chips for multiple generations to maintain economic viability. 2. Some bugoversight causing 13th 14th gen chips to damage themselves slowly with overvoltage issues. They say they have it under control now with the new microcode update. Only time will tell if that is true. Mistakes INVESTORS are worried about that we dont know the outcome of yet 1. Massive investments into new fabs without a clear roadmap, clientele, etc who will use their contracting services. This makes their balance sheet look like shit and if they dont get some big clients this will be a gigantic waste of money. 2. Their mistakes and anticonsumer approaches are degrading a core customer base in the server sector. AMD is also going after the server market more aggressively. This puts their long term market position in jeopardy. 3. They are making a lot of long term bets on things like GPUs that are hemmoraging money. While I believe this is probably best for them in the long term investors want their money this quarter and these types of plays are just not what they want to see. Reasons to be optimistic 1. Their current chips have honestly caught up to AMD. The 14th gen that arent killing themselves match or exceed the top AMD chips in a wide variety of tasks. 7800X3D is overall best gaming GPU but after that there is a long list of great performance cpus from intel. 2. The 9000 series from AMD is overall a bit of a dud. VERY little benefit over the 7000 series which a large part of the 14th gen already was beating. The 7800X3D still best for consumers and while most of the benefits for the 9000 series is for servers and heavey multithreaded workloads the jump isnt particularly impressive and well below what we normally expect for a generational leap. If 15th generation even an average boost compared to 14th gen its VERY likely intel takes a clear lead in the market. My take. Intel is making multiple long term plays and people are getting super ancy because they have had 2 major mistakes in the last decade. These are really risky gambles with hundreds of billions of dollars and if even 1 of these turns out to be a complete failure it will be a huge issue for the company. By end of 2025 first service fabs will be online, battlemage gpus will be out, and we will know if 15th gen is better than 9000 series or if they also stumble like AMD on this generational update. Given the massive hits in their recent stock, there likely is a lot of upside potential IF they pull it off. The idea they are risk adverse to me doesnt really track with their current heavy investment strategy. The culture might be risk adverse but they are playing with fire here. Messing up and having another microcode issue is something they CANT afford. AMDs messups are giving them an opportunity to regain their footing and we wont know how this plays out until probably end of next year. I expect the stock to go down or stay put until we see how these bets pay off and any investment in INTEL is just betting on this stuff working out. Only project that has me super worried for them is the contract fabs. Its REALLY not clear who they would be getting contract work from. Unless they get an Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc style client I honestly DONT know how they can justify the cost and I just dont see any of those companies leaving TSMC in a serious capacity. There just arent many customers in the world that can even use this service and stealing them from TSMC wont be easy."

MBA grads left now with no idea what to do. 1 Company is stopping dividends. 2 Company is not giving any cash bonus to their employees they are giving RSUs. Basically the internal buying of Intel which you see is Intel doing buy back and giving it to their employees instead of cash. Company is trying to save cash desperately. Even if TSMC stops tomorrow, Intel doesnt have enough good quality engineers left anymore. No amount of money is gonna save them. Pat got billions from US Govt my tax dollars and has not shown anything in real except promises and PPTs. Intel would have been obliterated long back. below points just prolonged their life a bit. 1 Pandemic Boom When chips, laptops, etc were selling like cakes. Intel also rode on the wave. 2 US Govt Funds Intel took billions on thr name of Natln Security to invest in local fabs only to pause work here and there."

They laid off Principal Architects, Chip Architects, many senior folks who were getting paid very high over 400K and companies try to do cost cutting rather than realizing the impact of it. Many of these folks moved to AMD, Amazon, Google and what not. I have friends who work in these positions and keep 1st hand info of where the talent is moving. Intel is drained of talent, Partners and Customers arw worried if they buy Intel chips can Intel even provide proper support for next 5yrs. Enterprise deals are locked in for 510yrs and customers look at Sellers health as well. First hand info coming that many customers are worried with Intels next 710yr survival and if they buy 20M of chips they might get stuck. It is not about making fastest chip on the block. AMD is increasing their ER and Intel is burning cash pile super fast and customers are losing trust. Wait till Nov 2024, You might hear something big coming up in favor of AMD. Intel will just end up like Cisco, IBM, GE. A company pioneered by engineers and ruined by MBA grads, All time high for these stocks can never come again. I know America loves these companies but data and facts should not be mixed with emotions."

I want to have access to my money although most of my stuff is in retirement accounts, and Im not at a proper age so maybe it doesnt matter. Just not worth the hassle for multiple, even if I dont have anything in them. Im always afraid Ill forget one at tax time I get its irrationalways to prevent that. Doesnt change my concern. I guess the thing that disappointed me, was with Robinhood I tried to close my account, and they basically said too bad, not gonna do it. Deactivate, yes, completely close and delete info, nope.

Your individual account will have a considerably broader spectrum of mutual and exchangetraded funds to choose from. This may or may not be a big deal.

If one team is stronger than another, you will be offered worse odds, such that the EV is equal to betting on the weaker team. Same with stocks. If one company makes more money than another, it will be priced higher such that the expected return is the same as the other. The market aggregates the weighted information from many participants and should be more accurate than even a wellinformed person. 1. EMH is a model. All models are wrong yet some are useful in some contexts. 2. EMH is a good starting point and you should justify any deviation from EMH, not the other way around. 2. Corollary you should not ignore anything just because it mentions EMH 3. Caveat you also should not ignore any purported deviation from EMH 2. Prices can only be efficient if people are doing the research and trading to make them that way. So markets can never be totally efficient. There is always some ephemeral edge and make money from it. 3. But you probably arent among them generalized you. Certainly the average investor cannot be. Expertise, resources, networks. 4. Fees. Whatever alpha someone might have, they will try to extract roughly all of it from their investors in fees. And on average managers cant have alpha since they compete against each other, but they can charge plenty of fees."

Prices are as accurate at any given moment as what people are willing to trade them at. On every side of a trade there is a buyer and a seller with different motives. One may be in retirement and wants to buy a vacation. One may be an index fund buyer blindly chocking away a paycheck. Many are people buying who think the sellers are stupid and many are sellers thinking the buyers are stupid. Some just lost their job and need to derisk.

EMH suggests that everything Zuckerberg knows would be built into the market, which is clearly wrong. Respectfully I think youre arguing a straw man. I have not met any prominent EMH believer who makes the claim that markets are strong form efficient. Not even Eugene Fama himself believes this. In fact, strong form efficiency is an impossibility, It creates a paradox referred to as the GrossmanStiglitz paradox. If markets were perfectly efficient, active managers wouldnt waste their resources bringing information to market, and if active managers no longer bring information to market, than markets are no longer efficient. Also, even if you assume a weaker version of EMH take a look at how EPS estimates changed for META. Did they go up 600 for 2025E? No. I havent looked at the data myself, but Ill give you the benefit of the doubt and assume this is market inefficiency. Even so, cherry picking one or a couple of instances of a market inefficiency does not justify throwing out the model. In fact, I think it is a model that is super important for active managers to incorporate into their own stock picks. To go further than that, I think the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis expands on EMH and allows active managers to determine the extent markets are efficient and how much alpha is available to them. That most active managers underperform is not evidence of EMH. Alpha is inherently zero sum, and if you are able to generate alpha, you will attract the majority of assets... I disagree. This supports the idea that markets become more efficient with time. If bad managers die out, what is left are the good managers which you mention have most of the assets. These good managers survive presumably because they are actually good managers and have good information, whereas the bad managers might survive for a short time due to luck but eventually die out. To further hammer this point home, some really successful active managers need to cap their funds, because their strategies cannot scale. Renaissance technology is a great example of this. The fact that their strategy can no longer accommodate additional capital should support the market efficiency idea. I dont disagree with this. The market is a tough game. Anybody who thinks this is easy is an idiot. But I dont think you can take away anything from EMH except that trying to generate alpha is extremely difficult to the point where unless youre in the 95th percentile, its probably not worth being more than a hobby for your average investor, and that you have to think about what other market participants are thinking and doing.

I genuinely think that the efficient markets framework is an integral component of successful stock selection, and even more so with an adaptive markets framework.

This didnt happen with META. The bear case was pretty known then TikTok and macro concerns. NA users went negative in Feb 2022.

If you start making up different variants of EMH and start saying oh yeah exceptions exist, this devolves into the market is tough, which I do agree with, but is a pointless discussion. Some information is incorporated into the market. It is impossible to tell to what extent, but its nowhere near all available information. It is possible to earn excess riskadjusted returns. Does this help you understand the relationship between META and EMH now? You can continue trying to make this personal trying to invalidate my credentials if you like despite you knowing nothing about me LOL, it doesnt really matter to me. Keep it up if youd like though, its amusing and shows insecurity."

I had to split this into two parts given length. From what I can tell, you are arguing the spirit of EMH is that markets are competitive. My stance is 1. The market is not anywhere close to perfectly efficient. It does not incorporate all public information, all private information, nor even necessarily historical price action. This is in direct contradiction to the textbook definition of all three forms of EMH. I am not disputing other theories that Im not versed on such as adaptive market hypothesis, nor am I disputing that markets get more competitive over time. 2. As a consequence of the market not being perfectly efficient, there are opportunities for a fundamental investor. I think people use the EMH as an excuse to shit on active managers, and in this subreddit in particular, also as an excuse to shut down aspiring analysts and most discussion of individual securities on here using the its priced in!!! meme. 3. As I said before, this doesnt mean its easy though. Im not going to belabor this point further as I believe we both understand. Going back to your very first comment The fact that there is a profitable incentive to being information to market is exactly why it is efficient. There is extraordinary competition to being information to market. I disagree with the bolded part. Its not efficient. It becomes more efficient by the day, but it is not efficient. Its not PERFECTLY efficient, that is an impossibility, but its extremely efficient to the point where most active managers fail to outperform their benchmark net of costs. I think you and I disagree on the extent of efficiency, but hard to tell given you never explicitly quantify this. However, theres definitively no linkage here between the first part of the sentence and the second, which I address later in this comment. Now directly addressing your most recent comment Respectfully I think youre arguing a straw man. I have not met any prominent EMH believer who makes the claim that markets are strong form efficient. Not even Eugene Fama himself believes this. I dunno how Im arguing a strawman when you never disqualified any forms of EMH in your original post. If you did, I missed it and strawmanning was not intentional. However, if you think strong form is false, the point is moot because I am in agreement, so I dont think theres any point in me elaborating further. Even so, cherry picking one or a couple of instances of a market inefficiency does not justify throwing out the model. Ill repeat myself from another comment to someone else in this thread if you need more samples, you can refer to Bessembinders study which showed 57 of stocks underperform t bills over their lifetime. This is nowhere near an efficient market in which participants expect to earn premia for taking risk. At the very least, it means theres plenty of short alpha available in the market."

                    "text": "I disagree. This supports the idea that markets become more efficient with time. If bad managers die out, what is left are the good managers which you mention have most of the assets. These good managers survive presumably because they are actually good managers and have good information, whereas the bad managers might survive for a short time due to luck but eventually die out. Markets do become more efficient over time. I never disagreed with this. But half, or even most of the active managers underperforming means nothing with regards to how efficient the market is. Alpha is zero sum. This is the definition of alpha as the residual of the regression of stock market prices against a given factor, it is not up for debate that the residuals have to add up to zero. As a consequence, there is no linkage between most active managers underperforming and the market being efficient. At either extreme of market being entirely efficient and not efficient at all, each dollar of positive alpha has to be offset by a dollar of negative alpha. If you are stating here that the market gets more competitive as assets aggregate to managers that consistently generate alpha, I am not arguing against this at all as a former practitioner, this was never in contention and I like to think that the job was tough and I competed hard for my paychecks against the platforms. But this doesnt serve as any indication as to how effectively information is priced in. This is why I think we disagree. This is a strawman youre arguing against. Plain and simple. Even the strongest EMH proponents do not believe this is true, it would be paradoxical to think otherwise, and like I mentioned, Eugene Fama himself does not believe this to be true. I spoke incorrectly. I should not have said never. However, EMH does hold that inefficiencies should not be repeatedly exploitable. If you believe that there are managers who consistently generate alpha, which I believe you do given you mentioned RenTech, then for them to generate that consistent alpha, there has to be consistent inefficiencies, which is what Im arguing for. Btw, youre a bit liberal with the term strawman. My original comment was just flat out wrong, but not every incorrect statement is a strawman. For future reference in your interactions on this platform, it comes across as you accusing me of being disingenuous which is not conducive to what I believe is a wellintentioned discussion on both sides. Respectfully, I am skeptical of claims random Redditors make lol. Out of curiosity, how did you justify those long positions? I genuinely think that the efficient markets framework is an integral component of successful stock selection, and even more so with an adaptive markets framework. Dunno what you want me to do with this, Im not doxxing myself. Im not selling you anything lol, Im not trying to big league you. Im just telling you from my experience, Ive seen that its possible to generate alpha consistently. Its actually immaterial to the discussion whether I myself generate alpha, just wanted to share an anecdote and hopefully a perspective you found interesting. If by efficient markets framework you just mean understand that the market is competitive, and chances are that the WSJ headline youre excited about was probably priced in 6 months ago, then yeah. Regarding justifying positions its understanding how the market thinks about a business, and if theres something thats either underappreciated or unappreciated, its diligencing that aspect, quantifying it in your model with EVIDENCE, which most people dont have the rigor to do, and if theres material difference in the KPIs the market is looking at, then you either go long or short. For example, take WOLF they manufacture silicon carbide wafers and they were a monopoly circa 20182019. I was able to prove that there was price compression and competition on the way. It was trading at like infinity times revenue, and sellside was falling over themselves upgrading the stock. Getting quotes from Crees salespeople, there was about 10 compression in ASPs each year. So I plug this into my model, see how this compares vs. how most people are thinking about the business and what it would look like 3 years out, and if there was a favorable riskreward skew, Id short it. I think I was below consensus by like 20 percentage points on gm, which is enormous. I hope you were successful though, and I hope you remain an active manager. Your commitment to bring information to market is exactly why passive investing strategies work for a couple of basis points a year . Thanks for the well wishes and Im glad you recognize the value of active management in pricing securities correctly. I will continue doing this until I either conclude I am not generating value or I am physically unable to."

Your definition was there is some sort of price reaction to new information, but its impossible to tell how much or which direction. Also the verbatim claim that market efficiency is separate from rationality of market participants, which is also incorrect. Go back and reread your own comment. So if a stock goes down on an acquisition with a 30 premium, this would fit your definition of EMH while clearly not fitting any real investors definition of what rational or efficient would be. Still havent heard a single elucidation of where Im wrong, but whatever. If you want my credentials, I worked for over 8 years in ls equity with my last position as senior analyst with direct oversight and trading authority for a third of AUM.

For one, modern asset pricing models are really good for explaining differences in returns amongst diversified portfolios. Prices adjust near instantaneously to new information. Technical analysis simply doesnt work. There is little persistence in mutual funds ability to outperform. people use EMH to shit on active management, alpha opportunities still exist and aspiring analysts should be discourage. I think its bad if EMH proponents shit on active managers. They are shooting themselves in the foot because active management is precisely why markets became efficient and why their strategy works to begin with. For what its worth, I would not consider my self completely under the passive umbrella. I too employ a semiactive strategy, overweighting certain stocks on partly on the basis that there are prevailing behavioral inefficiencies driving differences in returns momentum, value, etc. Regarding the Bessembinder paper, if you consider the extreme volatility of individual stocks, its no wonder that many go to zero and most of them underperform treasury bills, thats just basic statistics. But most of that volatility can just be diversified away. I dont exactly see why this contradicts EMH. I believe I mentioned before viewing markets as statistically efficient not fundamentally efficient. All prices are based on fundamental outcomes that are unknown. EMH doesnt make the claim that prices are right, merely that all known information is incorporated into the market price. half of or even most active managers underperforming is not evidence for EMH. I disagree here. The key here is persistence. Its not just that they underperform, but that those that are top quartile at one point in time seldom remain top quartile. This means that either that they were lucky, or their strategy no longer became profitable because any market inefficiency already got arbitraged away. Again why the best active managers will refuse to take your money. a bit liberal with the word strawman. Sorry, it wasnt my intention to accuse you of intentionally straw manning or arguing in bad faith. Im just trying to say, I dont know of any academic who argues for strong form efficiency, hence youre arguing against a position that no one that I know of really has."

Ive already said I dont believe the EMH is true, but strong returns from one stock in no way disproves it on its own. I mean look at NVDA, you can argue that EMH is wrong because of its returns but those returns are backed by new info being absorbed by the market increased chip demand, increased progress on next gen chips, profitability, future outlook of Huang, etc.. NVDA and META are not risky businesses in the sense that everybody knows theyre not going to fail anytime soon, however, they are risky stocks from a volatility perspective. Is that due to behavioral biases of investors and does that make them irrational? Or is it due to those being highly watched stocks where the info is absorbed so quickly by so many people the moves are hard and fast? Could be either. One of those explanations would disprove an assumption of EMH and the other is in favour of EMH. My only disagreement is that EMH does not preclude stocks from outperforming the market. If EMH were true, it would prevent investors from consistently outperforming on a risk adjusted basis which includes business risk, industry risk, stock volatility, as well as total portfolio risk and volatility holding 100 META is absolutely riskier than holding 100 SPY so should earn higher returns."

Your original comment Weak form is true in most markets where you have access to historical data. Semi strong form is likely true in a lot of highly covered markets such as the US large cap space. Strong form certainly isnt true. US large cap is probably the most efficient market and hardest to beat. Fixed income as a whole is quite inefficient and is easier to beat. The EMH specifically states that share prices reflect all available information from a given set of information and then the different forms of EMH split this down into the universes of information public and private strong, public only semistrong and then whatever is visible from price action weak. All the forms of EMH state that ALL available information from a certain universe of info is incorporated, and I disagree 100 with at least 2 of the three not being a trader, I have minimal expertise to be able to opine on the possibility of generating alpha from prior price action, although I do believe the persistent outperformance of momentum as a factor to be a ding against this as well. For clarification, weak form holds that investing off price action doesnt work, semi holds that all public information is incorporated, and strong holds that all information is totally incorporated is the generally accepted definition paraphrased. This was a quote of myself. You never actually define the EMH. My original comment was meant to indicate complete disagreement with 2, potentially 3 of the iterations of EMH, and therefore disagreement with your comment that semi strong form is likely true. You then go on to say I think an efficient market is different from a rational market. In my mind, efficiency just refers to how quickly new info is priced in, but has no influence on reaction size from this news or bullishness in general. Efficient markets are rational. You define efficient market differently from how the EMH defines it. Efficient markets have to be rational but rational markets dont have to be efficient, true, but I dont believe thats what you were saying here. You then go on to claim that efficiency is not linked to magnitude of moves. New info does have influence on reaction size. There have definitely been earnings where the company has reported, stock is up 8 but my EPS estimates go up 15 so I am a buyer of the stock. This is an efficient process I am incorporating my views into the stock price. So how do I interpret your claim that efficiency is not related to magnitude of reactionary moves? People will get things wrong, but people will try to quantify and price new information, which leads to buying and selling and is a process that improves pricing of securities. This is not a correct claim, and this is when I tell you that you need to Google things or know what youre talking about. I also acknowledged the rationality of market participants Market participants try to be rational, but I think there are many many times where they arent. I dont think we have material disagreements here though."

Strong returns from one stock where the price implied an unrealistic range of outcomes DOES imply irrationality exists. I was being flippant in my very first comment to you, but hopefully my 3rd and latter comments made it clear that I am not saying hey one stock did well, so therefore EMH cant hold. Returns alone dont prove that, but I am providing context supporting my belief that theres no way META pricing was reflecting all available information from any universe of possible information. I am saying that one stock was priced as if it was going out of business when it was highly profitable, had room to take expense out of the opex line, and even if you baked in secular decline which I was a believer in at the time, price still didnt make sense. Even the most bearish of my peers didnt understand the price action TMT analysts at MLP, p72, etc., so there wasnt any widespread fundamental narrative there was no new fundamental information being incorporated. This is a large cap stock, where sure, you take on idiosyncratic risk, but realistically most people dont expect these to outperform SPX by more than 500 bps, certainly dont expect them to post 300 returns over any 12 month time frame. I will tell you that nobody expects to earn 500 of outperformance owning a megacap tech stock over a 2 year span, which is what META did from Nov 4, 2022 to now. Ive already said I dont believe the EMH is true, but strong returns from one stock in no way disproves it on its own. You earlier said you believe the semistrong form to hold true. As mentioned above, my comments to other users in this thread before we even started discussing my later comments to you should have made it abundantly clear that its not just me saying a stock outperformed so EMH doesnt hold. In my other comments to users, I said that these returns are commensurate with what you would hope to get holding absolute garbage and junk with GME, Chinese ADR frauds, that type of thing in mind. Not what youd expect to earn holding a mix of quality, size, and internet exposure, and idiosyncratic business risk informed by my experience as a hopefully knowledgeable fundamental analyst didnt explain what was incorporated into price either. You only need one exception to disprove a hypothesis. I also dont see the linkage between small sample size and me having a misunderstanding of EMH. To that end, if youd said that sample size were the qualm for you, I wouldve pointed you to Bessembinders study showing that 57 of stocks failed to outperform TREASURIES over the past 100 years. How can that be remotely close to efficient when you are supposed to be compensated for bearing idiosyncratic risk? But thats not what you asked for. You just said that I dont understand what Im talking about. NVDA and META are not risky businesses in the sense that everybody knows theyre not going to fail anytime soon, however, they are risky stocks from a volatility perspective. Is that due to behavioral biases of investors and does that make them irrational? Or is it due to those being highly watched stocks where the info is absorbed so quickly by so many people the moves are hard and fast? Yes, there is a lot of information and headlines that come out around these stocks and this generates movement. Regarding reactions to news, this does contribute to increased efficiency assuming its being done by knowledgeable participants. I think you are not getting that my qualm with all forms of EMH is with the statement that all available information again from any given combination of public and private info is incorporated into stock prices, which is a very strong statement. I think you believe the EMH and its varying forms to just be weak some information is incorporated, semistrong some more info is incorporated, strong all information is incorporated, which is a misinterpretation and not correct as Ive said multiple times. My only disagreement is that EMH does not preclude stocks from outperforming the market. If EMH were true, it would prevent investors from consistently outperforming on a risk adjusted basis which includes business risk, industry risk, stock volatility, as well as total portfolio risk and volatility holding 100 META is absolutely riskier than holding 100 SPY so should earn higher returns. I agree with the bolded part. My point is that a alpha generation does happen and b there is no way all public information, let alone all public AND private information is incorporated into security prices, hence my total disagreement with at least 2 of the 3 forms of EMH. Again, I think the entirety of disagreement is due to you not understanding what the EMH is explicitly claiming, on top of which not having real security selection experience leading to comments like efficiency just refers to how quickly new info is priced in, but has no influence on reaction size from this news."

In my first comment I was talking more colloquially that public info is absorbed extremely quickly in some markets US large cap for example and more slowly in other markets fixed income for example. Sure, it doesnt perfectly meet the exact definition of EMH, but most people dont care about the exact definition, they care about the general efficiency of markets. The only thing I fundamentally disagree with you on is rationality because there is no universal definition of a rational market. There is no one arbiter of rationality and the correct stock reaction to news. In your example if the stock is up 8 but your EPS estimates are up 15, theres many other investors who may have different views on EPS estimates and make them more or less bullish which raises the price by more or less than your expectation. They are still rational investors. Lastly, I get your point on META and Id agree if META jumped from 90 to 600 independently, however, it went from 380 to 90 and back up to 600. Of course if we choose trough to peak returns it looks irrational, but if we zoom out a bit the stock goes from 380 to 600 or 300 to 600 which is a 100 or lower returns in a 33.5 year period. Still high but not necessarily irrational depending on the fundamentals and expectations of the company. I do agree that the price action of META and others was questionable, however, I question if we can define that as an irrational market. I do also realize that me arguing the inability to define the rationality of the market in relation to EMH is an idiotic hill to die on because I dont even believe most of the assumption of EMH are true. I probably didnt clearly explain my views yesterday initially but dont disagree with you on much and I apologize for my snarkiness."

To compare apples to apples not a great comparison but could ballpark compare what an annuity is getting compared to the interest rate on your current loan.

Who cares, you have a paid off house. Lose your job? Who cares, you have a paid off house and only need to come up with tax, utilities and food. One thing that people forget about when trying to optimize their money, is that when shit hits the fan, it hits the fan in every category. For example, in 2008 when the market crashed, housing crashed, stocks crashed 50, and unemployment was over 10, much more in certain fields. So one can say to oneself, in a crash, id just get richer, because id buy more. Well, during the crash is when you lose your job, your house goes down in value, so you dont want to sell and your mutual funds go down, so you sell into a loss. With a paid off house, you dont worry about any of this. John Goodman says it better than me."

If dividends dont inherently add value, why is this the case? Life is not just about numbers. And the differences between dividend payments and stock buybacks involve a great deal more than math. Dividends are usually distributed in a systematic way, and cutting dividend payments is seen as a very bad sign. So, a dividend is in effect a statement by management that they believe the company can perform and continue to deliver into the future. Boeing is a case study. Prior to 1998 investment in new aircraft programs and the companys reputation was seen as a way to protect investors, and the dividend, well into the future. Post 1998 the Jack Welch school that came to control the company was focused on short term results and stock buybacks. The difference between Boeing today and what is called in the industry legacy Boeing is stark."

Assumptions like management will always spend money in good faith to maximize earnings are useful if you want to make a world that is spreadsheetcompatible, but massively off the mark from the real world. In the real world management has incentives like getting the stock price to a certain number by a certain time to get a payout, future be damned. Creating unrealistic narratives about future earning to justify or increase PE ratios you know are excessive. Tech is a huge part of the SP500 and these problems are very common in tech. Around the dotcom crash this all got so bad that nobody could give out any dividends at all, for fear of demonstrating that they dont have endless golden geese lined up that the money would be better spent on. These days theyve gotten a little better about this and your Apple, Microsoft, and Google at least pay out a nominal dividend of like 0.51. Investors regularly get their money pissed up the wall like this in tech, when they would have been much better off just receiving it as a dividend than having tens of billions wasted on the metaverse with promises that all life would revolve around this concept in a few years, only to have them say actually never mind its all fake after a few years of stock options vesting at high valuations. Of course, were in the middle of a similar bubble with AI, so this all seems quaint now, but trust me, in a few years there will be a lot of people saying I wish they had just given me the money. So yeah, I like a small dividend, just to maintain a culture that this is my money they are playing with, and if they dont have a good use for it then Ill take it. A lot of this applies to share buybacks as well, although theyre prone to more bad incentives as they work through share price, so management is incentivized to do them even when the stock is already overvalued, and the personal incentives mentioned above etc."

Whether profits are retained or distributed, the firms underlying valuation remains the same. I highlighted the key phrase in that paragraph you wrote. That lines says taxes, law changes, wares, natural disasters, and diseases, and criminal activity are Irrelevant. Clearly that is not the case if you look through history. The resent a pandemic and hurricanes and Russias invasion of Ukraine have all had massive impacts on society and many businesses did not survive. Looking further back Enron was seen as a great investment until it was people discovered that the executives lied about the companies performance and illegally manipulated energy prices in california. A tariff war was initiated by US government in 1929 resulted in in an about 60 drop in trade and the SP500 loosing 13 of it value in about 2 days. Add in WW2 and the economy needed 14 years to recover. That one assumption in the theory make it it invalid. Things beyond the control of the company can quickly turn it from profitable to a money looser and eventually kill the company. Look at the dividend return and capital gains earnings of the SP500 seperately 74 of of the funds performance comes from reinvesting the dividends Only 26 came from capital gains. Clearly the dividends from the index, as small as it is, are important. Clearly the divided irrelevance theory is not a valid theory. this video also explains the problems with the theory."

During your accumulation phase you would be wrong to have any allocation other than a diversified portfolio that is spread between growth and value with some adjustment for whether we are in a Value or a Growth phase in the market. In the Early Accumulation phase you should be heavily invested in equities as you dont much care about down cycles as you have little money at risk. In the late accumulation phase you start to build in a strategy for up and down markets as you now have some principal to protect. In the Preretirement stage you start to worry more about beta and less about alpha particularly if you have done a good job of accumulation. In Retirement your goals are preservation and income, so less beta is more important than excess alpha unless you are late to the party. Assuming you have hit your goals, then joining rdividend and forgetting a growth allocation makes total sense. In that stage assuming a good number, you can use the dividends and leave the kids the equities at whatever value they may have when you are gone.

So if you generate 100m in cash flow a year, a lender will most likely be willing to extend 300 400m or 3 to 4x cash flow. The primary reason being is a company will trade at some much higher multiple say 7 to 20 times depending on business so if youre only lent 3 to 4, you are safely inside a potential EV of the company. Secondarily, the lender wants to ensure you generate enough cash flow to cover the interest expense of the debt. There are other underwriting metholdogies though, multiple on recurring revenue or pure asset based lending against liquidation value of assets are two other common ones"

Her investments were conservative except being highly concentrated in Berkshire Hathaway, which frankly isnt actually a terrible concentration when you look at the underlying businesses they are in.

They are based in Boca Raton but all the notes are shares of shell companies incorporated in the Caymans. These notes are paying 14 annually for 3 to 5 years each, this is around 2015 when rates are close to zero and commercial paper is paying 3.5. This shit is the most obvious red flag scam anyone with half a brain has ever seen. I drag Grandma into my office and have a sit down with two senior partners who have far more experience than me. We all go hard on laying out the case that shes getting scammed. All she sees are checks coming in and they never missed a payment ever for her sister! Shes unreachable in terms of convincing her shes playing with fire. The only thing I manage to get from her is to stop buying more of this garbage. Shes already in for 270k, total net worth around 750k at the time. Its a fucking horror show. Well you know what happens next. The company goes insolvent, the cofounder commits suicide by jumping off his boat in the Caribbean, the other bag holder cofounder get a DOJ indictment, and the whole shit show goes into corporate receivership under Florida law. The company was Seeman Holtz, feel free to Google it and see just how fucked all these long island Jews are for trusting those nice men who kept taking lonely widows out for dinners and calling them every week. Grandmas sister lost her husbands entire life savings of 5 million and is currently considering a reverse mortgage to pay her property taxes in a very expensive zip code. So yeah, by this time Ive left the financial advisory industry because I cant take sucking up to wealthy dumbasses anymore. Since Im no longer her fiduciary advisor I demand she set me up as a full durable POA if she wants my help. She admits defeat accepts reality and hands the keys over.

By the time she got someone who knew what they were doing, if ever, enough time had passed that it could never be resolved through a simple phone call more than likely you needed a notarized letter. Unfortunately, the idiots she was talking to at THAT time were also probably new so they had no idea and just said oops I feel sorry for you but nothing I can do. The incompetence is astronomical among the phone representatives and for good reason Vanguard targets foolish undergrads that have no idea what they are getting into AND they pay below average. So when their hires find out they are literally just a phone farm and they are getting paid less than the industry for it, they leave, causing massive turnover and requiring Vanguard to get more dogshit people. Because the turnover is so high, no one knows what they are doing but still have to meet metrics so they just lie to get people off the phones. By default, the clients get pissed and take it out on the new reps that have no idea what they are doing causing them to leave making vanguard hire more inexperienced people further pissing off their clients and so on. Unfortunately, Vanguard doesnt give two shits and a shake because their retail arm for people under 5MM doesnt make them that much money. Their power comes from their institutional side and index retirement funds. As a retail investor, youre a drop in the bucket unless youre handing over 5MM to their Personal Advisor Services."

OTC means overthecounter and its considered unlisted. It appears to have been a sponsored ADR A depository bank created the product on the OTC and its sponsored by the company. In this particular case they weree depository receipts from BNY. Occasionally, the depository or the sponsor may terminate the ADR for various reasons. A termination notice would have been disclosed. In your case see attached If you did not sell out your position before the termination issuance on 927 you will have to go through the liquidation process. The last day to trade BMWYY was 926. Your investment is NOT worthless It should be approximately USD20ish or more per share. When an ADR terminates normally you have a choice to get the shares and deposit into a local custodian in this case you need a German brokerage account or your broker can try to liquidate it for you and get you cash value back assuming your broker offers those services. But there is a fee to do that because of the bookeeping, currency risk, etc. involved thats probably what the 300 is for. This is why investing in unlisted ADRs and OTC securities are considered riskier if you dont monitor your investments. edit fwiw in case anyone else cares. When you invest in unlisted ADRs the 2 major depository banks providing DR services are BNYMellon and Citi. BNYMellon has some better monitoring capabilities and it can be found here Termination notices like the one for OPs BMWYY look like this The termination notice provides options for ADS holders. In this particular case, the depository plans to create an unsponsored ADR so that sponsored ADR holders could transfer their holdings to the new security. An unsponsored ADR means that BMW is not associated with the actual ADR anymore."

Is that okay for a Roth IRA, or should I be looking to diversify more globally? US only is single country risk, which is an uncompensated risk one that doesnt bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk Bold mine Uncompensated risk is very different it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, or country. Many people try to use the excuse that SP 500 companies do lots of business overseas, but that isnt the international coverage that actually matters. Companies will act more like the market of their home country, so foreign revenue isnt the international exposure that actually matters The purpose of the international holdings is to be covered during the orange periods of the graph here Plus thats true of large companies in most countries. There are many market sectors where foreign companies are some of the key players and do lots of business within the US, but that doesnt mean we can go 100 IXUS. Going global can both help with returns and volatility."

Usually when there is a corporate action the depository would publish a process for dealing with the corporate action. A foreign ordinary is basically what it sounds like. You are actually buying the shares through a dealer over the counter of the actual shares that list on the ASX. But I do not know much about the custody process for F shares. The FAQ that I linked implies that it may be held in the local market which would be in Australia. contacted Byron and that was the response. Ok yeah that kinda makes sense. The terminology used in Australia is different than in the US so I think that may be synonymous with custodian. to a broker at Schwab Try calling again different brokers have different levels of knowledge. Ask specifically about how Schwab processes corporate actions for F shares. Schwab will have a dedicated corporate actions desk. The people at a brokerage that process corporate actions are probably not brokers."

AppLovin reaches out to 100s of parties that theres user X with iPhone 16 in roughly this geo area interested in an ad, give me your bid. This type of ad auction leads to some identifiable info being shared to many parties. This is sometimes sold as bulk datasets. You can then use that dataset to get a rough idea on where the person was. Then you got the more shady places and more shady apps that literally log your gps location and WiFi networks nearby. These shadier companies will sell this dataset for money. All this marketing data can then be used to roughly know where everyone in your household is going to. For example if I know you work at a Starbucks, and I see a phone to from your house to Starbucks then back every Monday through Friday for roughly 95. I know that phone Id belongs to you.

You can replace jepidividend fund with any other stock and the answer remains the same. They arent going to create extra cash in your Roth any more than more shares of VOO will. Investing half in JEPI instead of VOO may yield a better return, or it may not. That depends on the performance of the fund and of the SP. If your question is, should you pick companiesfunds to try to beat the SP, the answer depends on your risk tolerance, willingness to research and actively manage your Roth, and so on. Its certainly possible. I think certain dividend funds are almost sure to perform worse, like SCHD, which values lower volatility and a stable income source more than growth. Others, like certain REITs, have historically outperformed the SP and may continue to do so."

You would rather have everything in your roth, invested in the highest returning ETF which will be an index oriented ETF ideally tracking SP 500 or US stock market. The dividend is counted as part of total return. If you were to compare a dividend etf yielding 5 and total return of 6 versus SP total return of 7 you are comparing 6 vs. 7. The dividend is not extra money. Reinvesting the dividend is the same as remaining invested in an equal returning etf without dividends. Semiirrelevant, but you will also be receiving some dividend through any indexoriented strategy. If this is some sort of account switching shenanigans... if you were to invest outside of your roth and transfer in the dividend yield, you are paying unnecessary taxes and SIGNIFICANTLY hurting your return. Example with 100, a 10 dividend, 30 tax You receive 100 You invest it in a dividend ETF yielding 10 One year later, you have collected 10 in dividends and paid 3 in tax, net transfer or gain of 7 to Roth Alternatively, if you had just put that into the SP in your roth to begin with call it 10 return... you would simply have a gain of 10 in the account. No tax. Lots of mental gymnastics I really dont follow the bottom line is there is no hack for investing greater than your contribution limit. If you want to maximize your roth account, simply transfer in the max contribution and invest within the roth within the highest returning asset you can. from a risk return basis, you should just be doing market indices. Generally 7030 US and global exUS is recommended, although doing all US certainly is acceptable as well."

The reason is your investment time horizon is much further than mine now in retirement, youd be foregoing major upside potential. You could instead invest SCHD dividends in future VOO etc. Id suggest this option you suggested, if it was my proposed VOO investment money Wait and see if we have perhaps a 5 correction and then dca. However, SP .SPX was recent highs 5661 on 716, and it was 5346 on 82, 5.5 correction. So, youre at your 5. But is it done declining? My analysis says likely not. Look at this chart See top, middle, and bottom chart sections. Notice in particular the MACD chart at bottom, red and black curves. In short, MACD is a buy sell pressure indicator with ascending curves above zero midline buy, descending below dont buy. I observe both red and black MACD curves plunging, well below zero, black below red and descending faster, no upcurve in sight. Combine this with price action center chart strongly down at most recent far right. This tells me all the decline is not priced in yet and more SP carnage to come in next daysweeks. If I was in your position, Id stay in SPAXX and watch this chart until MACD trend reverses, black surpasses red, and charges toward getting above the zero line. Look at the chart again Tuesday, compare to last Friday. Yes, this is called timing the market. Can save you money on your basisentry point of a lump investment if you know what youre doing. You wont hit it exactly, but you wont buy too soon. This impacts your VOO and possibly SCHD entry timing., but you can look at their individual charts at the link above for details on them specifically. Disclaimer I can be wrong. Not financial advice, just what Id do. As always, time in the market beats timing the market. If this doesnt pay off for you in a few days you might want to reconsiderdisregard and plunge. You might want to consider staying invested in what you choose and adding to it DCA in the future to maximize your yields. Jumping around to various hot ETFs of the day is not wise IMHO in the long run."

JPMorgan analysts told clients after field work and discussions with management, they cut their estimate for VFs fiscal 2025 earnings per share. The analysts pointed to wholesale challenges with The North Face, and ongoing traffic headwinds across brands. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients that after recent fieldwork and management access, they cut their fiscal 2025 earnings per share EPS estimate to 65 cents, which they noted was 35 below the Wall Street consensus. The analysts based that on an 8 yearoveryear decline in revenue, also worse than consensus forecasts. Ill add that Im not saying just because JPM says its bad, its bad. But wanted to get your take on why its not bad. Why not just wait till after Q2 print to buy to see where things shake out. How did you get comfortable.

Corp has experienced fluctuations in its financial performance over the past four fiscal years, showing growth in revenue but facing challenges with declining net income. The companys EBITDA and operating income have varied significantly, while balance sheet metrics have seen declines. Margins and ratios have been mixed, with a notable drop in net profit margin. VFC has faced both positive and negative news in the market and is exposed to diverse risks across operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG factors. Key Financial Insights Revenue increased from 9.24 billion in 2020 to 11.61 billion in 2023 but declined to 10.45 billion in 2024. Net income dropped significantly from positive figures to a loss of 968.88 million in 2024. Gross profit margins remained stable, ranging from 41 to 52. Positive free cash flow in most years, except for 2023. Historical volatility of 58 indicates moderate stock price volatility compared to the market. Risk Factors Operational risks from supply chain disruptions and quality control issues. Regulatory risks related to trade policies, labor regulations, and environmental standards. Macroeconomic risks including economic downturns, currency fluctuations, and inflation. Competitive risks due to industry competition and evolving consumer preferences. Technological risks from cybersecurity threats and the need for digital investments. ESG risks impacting brand reputation and consumer perception. Conclusion Given the mixed financial performance, market sentiments, and diverse risks facing V.F. Corp, it is recommended to hold the stock for now. Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports, risk management strategies, and industry trends before making any significant buying or selling decisions."

I agree that TNF is currently the revenue driver hence this delayed winter in the States could affect sales. But keep in mind 60 of the sales comes from Europe Asia. Only 40 of it comes from the US. One thing this analyst Matthew Boss didnt add in his thesis is the thriving backpacks business of TNF, this and international sales would likely offset the decline in the US. One more thing is that the CEO has already guided TNF revenue downwards for the coming quarter last earnings call. The stock also has retraced since this negative catalyst watch, so you could argue it is priced in. The problem with holding off the purchase because of this one negative catalyst is that when all the other brands show signs of turning Vans, Timbs, Dickies of which the latter two and he announces two more brand sales Jansport Kipling and completely brings us back to optimal capital structure, we would be off to the races, being potentially valued at 1x PS which would be 10B in market cap."

What Vans has that Adidas and Nike doesnt is the relentless support from subcultures punks, alts, creatives, skaters, lgbtq, surfers, etc... And guess what, this portfolio of brands are trading less than an individual brand like Crocs or Birkenstock.

However, challenges in managing cash flow, increasing debt levels, and low liquidity ratios pose risks to the companys financial health. Despite facing operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks, LLY remains a key player in the pharmaceutical industry with opportunities for growth through innovation and expansion. Investors should carefully consider these factors in their investment decisions. Key Financial Insights Strong revenue growth from 24.54 billion in 2020 to 34.12 billion in 2023, representing a 39 increase. Healthy profitability margins with Gross Profit margin at 79.2 and Net Profit Margin at 15.3. Total Assets increasing steadily to 64.01 billion in 2023, reflecting a strong asset base expansion. Focus on revenue diversification, cost optimization, and debt reduction for sustained growth. Operational efficiency improvements and innovation investments are crucial for longterm success. Risk Factors High debt levels with Net Debt growing from 12.94 billion in 2020 to 22.41 billion in 2023. Negative Free Cash Flow in 2023 signaling liquidity challenges. Low liquidity ratios Current Ratio 0.94, Quick Ratio 0.92 indicating potential cash flow constraints. Operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks impacting financial performance. Moderate Value at Risk VaR of 0.45 pointing to a moderate level of risk associated with investing in LLY. Conclusion Given the companys strong revenue growth and profitability trends, coupled with the risks posed by cash flow management and debt levels, investors should exercise caution. A hold recommendation is advisable at this juncture, allowing for further monitoring of operational improvements and debt reduction strategies to better gauge the companys longterm financial stability and growth potential."

On top of that it works perfectly with solar fields and wind power fields to store the electric energy as hydrogen if theres an excess of supply.

Diagnosis and treatment. From wearable monitoring tech, to individual creation of medications based on an individuals genetic makeup. Education. A well trained AI could provide 247 training and support. The same could be used for customer service. Agriculture is already using autonomous vehicles for plowing, seeding, spraying, and cropping.

In fact, it does the opposite. But youd be correct, had they done that.

Expect big drops of 20 in mid cap stocks and even more in small caps. Within a week. This happens also for the upside like we see this month for a lot of the U equities. That said, there is unbelievable valuation and immense upside to many uranium juniors and business focused on the fuel cycle enrichment etc. This sector moves at a glacial speed, and many stocks do get ahead of themselves. Do lots of homework on companies that are developers of mines. The only producers that need to be considered for a newbie is Cameco, Uranium energy Corp, boss energy and energy fuels. If you want more then look at Sprotts Uranium information on their website. Dont listen to hype on YouTube, X, and other sources. Its a great opportunity to buy a non fungible, scarce and undervalued commodity, but dont expect to make life changing money if you consider yourself an average investor, much of the easy money has been made already in the sitting and waiting. Now is the time to look for value, performance and the companies that are actually going to be able to mine this resources at significant quantities well into the future. Alongside the companies involved in the other services in the sector. This bull market is not a flash in the pan. This time for the nuclear industry, its game on."

On top of that, demand for uranium is expected to grow as China and other nations continue to build nuclear reactors. Prices have been fluctuating, but many experts believe they will rise again due to these supply and demand dynamics. Whats also interesting is how big tech companies are now getting involved. Microsoft recently signed a deal to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power its data centers, while Oracle is building small modular reactors SMRs to fuel its AI data centers. These reactors are expected to deliver over 1 gigawatt of electricity, showing just how critical energy demand has become in powering AI growth. This could lead to even higher demand."

Personally, Im more excited by DoE funded research on converting tailings. All of your cost is in processing ore thats already dug up, and the potential for government funding is huge if you can clean up an area with historic minerelated hazards.

This decays into Protactinium233, which further decays into Uranium233. Protactinium233 can be removed from the liquid salt of a tworegion MSR by reductive extraction into liquid bismuth. Basically a breeder reactor that uses a cheaper and more abundant fuel source. This style of reactor was designed in the 1950s and I honestly believe the main reason this hasnt been developed further is more due to proliferation risks than cost or feasibility. Since the Protactinium233 can be extracted rather easily and would be of high concentration, it would reduce a lot of the work needed to make a nuclear weapon. Mainly removal of neutron emitters and other purification steps to get to 95 purity of Uranium233. Uranium233 is a fissile isotope."

Sure theres a nuclear renaissance currently ongoing but micro reactors are micro e.g. small meaning less required fuel and many are far from being deployed in the coming years. If mines are actually going to reopen then its more than reasonable to assume that theyll open in time before demand surges. Also historically the price of uranium varies between 20120 and this isnt the first time weve had a nuclear renaissance. Realistically, we have near infinite uranium on earth. In the worst case scenario, we can take uranium from the ocean and power the world with that for millions of years."

                    "text": "TL,DR from ChatGPT Summary Uranium Market Report Price Trends Since 2020, uranium prices have surged from 21lb to 106lb in February 2024, currently stabilizing at 83lb. The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected. Uranium Overview Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U238 used in military applications and U235 used to fuel nuclear reactors. U235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal. HALEU and Enrichment Highassay lowenriched uranium HALEU is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives. Supply Challenges Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 1015 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30 by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap. Demand Growth The U.S., China, and France account for 58 of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28 increase in demand from 20232030 and a 51 rise from 20312040, driven by global clean energy goals. Global Production Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43 of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward selfreliance. Investment Insights The report suggests that mining companies are wellpositioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector. Conclusion The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uraniums role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.

It was calculated that 700lbs is the cutoff at which point it becomes uneconomical to keep running the reactors. this is 8x the current price. due to these factors, uranium supply is priceinelastic"

Energy fuels is just a small piece of the pie, and yeah it may punch above its weight in years to come with their approach to building a company with multiple revenue streams but also remember that they dont have the biggest and richest deposits of uranium, their CEO has stated to the annoyance of many keen investors that he is doing things his way.

And if we create enough windmills to have enough energy in the winter then theyll be sitting on their arses whole summer. It is not a solution for baseline energy it is a complementary solution to the baseline. Then you fill in with renewables and batteries which can also charge from overproduction of a nuclear facility. Furthermore I think energy production should be more decentralized which reduces the scale of some energy plants and makes it more cost effective. See SMR which china is already starting production of. If we can streamline and make the production of it more efficient itll probably even cost less money than all other energy sources."

You never want to run out of bullets when that kind of situation happens, and I can assure you, they will happen, way more than what we expect actually. TIGR is an outlier on the speed and size of the gain, but in terms of degree of certainty, it only ranks slightly above average for me.

The reason people dont pile money into Chinese companies is because a significant portion of the profits in those companies are extracted by insiders. Whether thats public or private insiders doesnt matter, and in China theyre often the same thing. Since 1995, the SSEC has basically 5Xed. Meanwhile, their GDP went up about 21X. At least in real estate, people know they have a real asset. Not just a piece of paper that says you own part of a company. And you have to depend that this company is providing real financial statements, not hiring their brothers concrete company at 10X market value to redo their parking lot every month. Equity ownership can only provide excess returns if the businesses are run transparently. The default human behavior in most places is corruption. Its incredibly easy, and many times impossible to really tell. Especially at higher levels. But how can we expect a country like China, where corruption is firmly embedded in publicprivate sector, to suddenly flush it out? Xi can say or do whatever he wants. Smart money knows to stay away from China. Sure, you can allocate a small portion of a portfolio. But smart money knows its a risky play. Smart money is focused on capital preservation. They arent going to spray and pray that China has fixed their bullshit. If you wanna spray and pray, might as well just go buy BTC. At least you know the rules, and they are visible to everyone. Not the case with China and many other countries with rampant corruption."

Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations."

Helicopters are considered mature technology yet also still very dangerous. Energy density of oil is still vastly superior to any batteries available which puts some hard current limits on things like range versus capacity. That said, theres some key differences between those and evtol. From a risk management perspective, All its going to take is one highly public Kobe Bryant or a Troy Gentry and the whole things going to crater. Thats very hard to predict but its still immature and early enough is thats all it going to take to eat massive losses. Its cheap enough Ill go ahead and put down some funny money on it in long, but its money Ive accepted could instantly go down in flames if a Kobe happens"

I only believe in Joby and I strongly feel Archer is going to fold or go bust in 4 years or less. I will give reasons for this in short as I dont have patience n dont have time or care to convince anyone. 1. Joby truly developed eVTOL from scratch and have complete new new design. Archer is just electric helicopter where they are assembler of aircraft where why may have just swap the engine with electric motors. Due to this their aircraft is almost 1200lbs heavier than Joby. This in itself going to kill then in operating cost and cannot compete with Joby which will multi fold efficient n cheaper to operate thereby cheaper on pricing 2. Archer is mostly style n less substance. Their flight has yet to do extensive flight testing. They are flying empty . So currently its just baloon with no payload. Once you add payload most likely their design will go bust. The design is too heavy n bulky 3. Dilution Archer is going for extensive dilution every quarter against plant setup and labor supply from Stellantis . Moreover they plan issue more shares. 4. Archer certification in time is very difficult given they need to integrate number of desperate components n technology. Joby developed almost 8090 IP inhouse so they integrate seamlessly with common software language. 5. Archer is led by businessman vs Joby is led by technocrat 6. Joby has successfully tested hydrogen flight. In 56 year they will have it approved. Then they will have huge cost advantage and unparalleled technology edge 7. Autonomy only Joby has full autonomous rights to their own plane. Archer sold it to WiskBoeing. Robo AirTaxi. This is where real money is. Believe me Robo AirTaxi will happen before TeslaWaymo or Aurora. Once you do in depth study you will uncover few more obvious reasons why archer is way behind and over priced at current valuation. Overall Archer is not gonna pop its gonna poop soon."

Ive looked into Archer a few times now and while Im tempted to buy in, I have a couple of hurdles Im struggling to get over. First of all Im having a hard time seeing a scenario where they arent just acquired by another megacorp. Boeing going ballsdeep and consolidating them with Wisk makes a lot of sense both companies are functionally the same, it merely seems to be the case that Archer want to push a more VIP and militaryoriented aircraft lineup while Wisk is designed much more in the mould of an airtaxi Uber. Stellantis might also be interested in a direct acquisition if they can envision a more profitable return by cutting out other major investors like United and Boeing, as well as gaining them exposure to valuable US military contracts. Im also not fully convinced by the eVTOL airtaxi concept. As a means of rapid transportation it does have potential is there anyone who doesnt want to reach their destination not just in style but also half an hour earlier?? but I need to know exactly how theyre going to make it affordable for people that arent just highincome earners, because otherwise it will ultimately be an unprofitable service due to the complexity of the technology and the lack of a large clientele base. The stock has a lot of potential but the hurdles are really fucking big, I aint gonna lie."

Thanks to your amazing DD, think I will start loading more calls, thanks for that!! P.S. your military case is more right on than you know. These are coming, the investment from the DoD is there and many are excited about it. They will be used for troop equipment transport in CA very soonthey have many bases in fairly close proximity so the use is obvious. Theres talk of putting them on some ships to gather supplies without needing to go inland, so many uses have been discussedwith more uses being revealed all the time. I see the military being a large enough customer even without the commercial aspects, but they have that too! I too believe that ACHR will be huge in the coming years!"

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. ... However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. ... While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations."

You make a big deal about creating their own IP but Archers counter point is that their parts are industry standard and can be purchased and produced more easily. Personally, I think both have a fair point. Archer also has their own IP in the most important parts which include the drive train. 2. I really like the look and feel of Archer way more than Joby. Joby looks like they took a drone from DJI and scaled it up to a person capable aircraft. Not necessarily a bad thing but as far as style goes Archer definitely has that edge. Also, they will soon have their pilot test certification soon. So thats no really a great argument against them. Their fortest certification is coming soon and will be a major announcement. 3. Nothing really to say here as this stuff aint cheap. Raising capital is something they both have to do. Its not like you can make the argument that Joby doesnt have to do this too. Both are have delivered aircraft to the military and both are set to deliver more. Again, both will be players in this arena and thats a good thing. Competition is a good thing. Dont forget a short report and subsequent short float on Joby is a thing too as their short is about 19. The reason why I chose Archer however is that their current market cap has much deeper value than Joby at these current levels. Currently Joby is valued at 3.74 Billion while Archer Aviation is valued at only 1.09 Billion with a much higher float. So, with all of that I have to think Archer at this moment is a better buy. Both of their market caps can easily be in the 50 100 Billion range in the 4 6 year future which will be a substantial gain for all those invested. In the short term, if Archer keeps pushing and gets their certs a 3x increase will be a 3 Billion market cap and that seems completely justified. That would also be a 300 increase in the stock price from 3 to 9 a share. I say this is an easy bagger if you ask me. Deep fucking value if there ever was one."

Dont forget, Archer first started off with the Maker which was a smaller aircraft. The hydrogen thing is not really important right now so lets get these guys flying first and then we can advance to more payload, larger eVTOLs in general and further distances. I think the pipeline for both of these companies will be great. They just need to get off the ground first. Literally. Again, one has a current market cap of 3.47 B and the other only 1 B.

Also how does an eVTOL pilot cost less? They still have to be trained to the standard that the FAA requires and since they are flying a vehicle that can fly like a helicopter or an airplane, they need to have training in both, something that is certainly not cheap. Being quieter might be nice but it offers not much of a benefit. Any aircraft that is within the noise limits will work, you dont get bonus points for being quieter. And using nontraditional fuels isnt really a flex when most airports dont have the chargers for them. Also being cool doesnt mean useful.

Also to be at the level of Uber, you need at least 50,000 ol these eVTOL in each city. Just not happening. WaymoUber will have every driver replaced with their autonomous vehicles in 10 years.

Currently they have approval to fly only for insight conditions so they need to first cross that barrier Agree that Waymo is ahead than Tesla. Honestly these are two diff markets. I see with autonomy more traffic will be on road increasing congestion so we will have to go to air. Biggest problem I see with eVTOL is it would be 3 rides to get to destination to heliport, air ride and then from heliport to final destination. eVTOLs have use cases diff than road travel flying from JFK to Long Branch NJ, between islands in Caribbeans, city centers to outskirts suburban mansions etc before they go full main stream. Not in 10 but in 20 years they will be mass produced like cars today and folks will have this in their backyard or walkable garages. Sounds unbelievable but thats the future I see."

When you say it has no relevance, I agree about its relevance is dated with new language models and actual artificial intelligence. But my original point was just how bad Siri is. You said chat gpt 4 cant pass the Turing test. Which its been proven to do. No matter what your view on the stupidity of the average person, it still passes. It prob wouldnt fool you, but thats not the parameters. It sounds like you think the Turing test needs to be able to be able fool every single person to pass, but thats not possible even for actual artificial intelligence. Someone would guess correctly in any sample size. Your tone is coming to me as if you are really taking this way more than just a friendly back and forth.

Their software segment is growing revenues north of 50 70 EBITDA margins. This segment should sustainably grow revenues above 20 and is where all the value is, not the app segment. This is now a 40billion market cap, the bigger you get the more lawsuits you get hit with. You could just write this short piece for Meta or google who get hit with these lawsuits every day. If this was valued like TTD it would be worth 300share. TTD is a comp, APP is a bit of a black box so should trade at a discount. However, trading at more than a 50 discount seems too much. The market is just starting to realize this is an AI driven company wextremely high profitability. They also are an undercover Meta since they have the largest share of mobile app users 1.5bn users they have info on. That is extremely powerful, tell me how many companies out there have touchpoints with that many users they are all massive companies. The multiple on this company should be a lot higher. if ecommerce works for them that is a much bigger opportunity than their existing market. No reason this couldnt be a 100bn company. You are pissing in the wind here and you know it."

Google buys from them for example. This business has been growing every quarter for many years. They do rely on google and apple app stores which is a clear negative but given pressure from regulators in Europe and US wa potential justice department breakup of google, they wont F with Applovin their hands tied and cant be viewed as monopolistic. IMO this is a unique time where there is a window for Applovin to become much bigger. In terms of insider selling, a lot of these sales are for tax net settling of shares. But yes many others have been outright selling. CEO still owns billions of stock and many insiders still own large amount of shares relative to what they sold. KKR doesnt count, they 10x their money and their fund vintage was ending, so they needed to sell. You can also make same argument for META or NVDA, ton of insider selling there. Also the valuation isnt even close to bloated. They report GAAP earnings but if you add back amortization and stock based comp like every peer does, they are trading low 20s PE for a business growing 20 wvery high incremental margins. Thats very inexpensive in this market."

I will always be FOR that...however the behavior of the founders and csuite does not reflect a solid alignment with this end goal. They would not sap billions from the coffers at their first opportunity, when their company may need all the help and good will that it can get over the coming quarters. I do not believe that large funds give an eff about this company beyond the extent to which they can accumulate and distribute shares over and over again, kinda like the apparent behavior of the principals of the company.

I dont know if this is the same case for the magic shrooms but just some food for thought. This very well could be a normal side effect for antidepressants, however there is supposed to be a grace period within the first few weeksmonths of beginning the meds, afterwards the heightened risk should subside in theory. If the risk is not subsiding in these mushrooms and these patients are ultimately left with more ideations after treatment thats definitely not a great sign in my opinion"

And most retail investors probably are not thinking that far in advance theyre probably mostly just trying to get in on some FOMO. So honestly, I think the earnings will be another beat and well see an overnight jump in price, but then I think most of the institutional investors will pull out and when the market opens tomorrow morning, the crash begins... first NVDA tanks, and immediately with it all the related semiconductor and AI companies will pull down as well... and then momentum will build and the entire SPY will go in the toilet. I think the longawaited market crash begins tomorrow."

The real key here will be the forward guidance. Not only are earnings being reported, but Huang is doing an interview with Bloomberg at 630pm which may point to further positive company progress. All other forward guidance for tech stocks like Apple, Google, and Tesla included increased investments in AI so that they dont fall behind in innovations. Additionally, well likely see some guidance about Blackwell which has already started rolling out. Add all that together and youre likely to see some movement itll be volatile Thursday and Friday, but I still think well see upward progress and pushing ATH by middle of September.

Basically even if 9 of their landers exploded if the 10th made it on the Moon safely NASAs saving money and thats the whole point. Far ahead of commercial rivals and has some juicy contracts. News about the newest one possibly being awarded to them are huge if true. Anyone who knows anything about space missions from an engineering standpoint knows that space is hard and a mission like their IM1 is a resounding success. Tons of things could have gone wrong and didnt. Some highlights are them being the first private company to land on the Moon, have a working 3d printed engine of their own design that worked in space, first liquid methaneoxygen engine to work above LEO and basically their shit works and is very well designed. Their selling point is that theyre cheaper than NASA. Ive said the same shit 100 times on here but regards were like Bbut the lander tipped over. Ok regard. Company is solid, stock was trading for a steal all these months. 5 and below is a good cost average to hold this. It will pump when next launch and if contract is confirmed.

They have incredible talent and everyone wants to work there. They are already way past the initial startup stages. Their Starlink is literally funding all their experiments and testing. And even if it werent, Big falls over themselves to give Musk money for his projects even if some of them are catastrophies for the banks like Twitter They are winning government contracts and NASA might have to beg them to rescue their astronauts because Boeing is a dumpster fire that will be a huge piece of marketability for spacex. That is my only concern if were talking long term Will the space accommodate more than 1 player maybe? Probably? See Boeing. Just some random thoughts from an imbecile online"

It was in 2003 that Altemuss name first became widely known, back when he was working for NASA in the human spaceflight division. On Feb. 1 of that year, the space agency was shaken to its roots, after the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated on reentry, claiming the lives of its sevenperson crew.

Private companies and other countries pay to put their payload on their ship to be sent to the moon. Theyre essentially providing a bus service to deliver your stuff to the moon. 2 Theyre building a network of satellites around the moon, so you can keep radio contact around the clock with people or devices and machines on the moon. This is essentially the NSNS contract thats pumping the price now. If anybody needs to communicate with their payload or astronauts on the moon, they can pay to use the satellites there, like a telco service. 3 Theyre building larger moon lander, to deliver up to 1.5 tonnes payload. They also planning to continue developing the VIPER moon rover by NASA and deliver it through this Lander. So future companies and other countries can pay LUNR to deliver vehicles and heavier payloads to the moon. 4 Theyre developing navigation system for US military satellites, they won the contract recently. 5 There is a plan to build a space station to orbit the moon, so we can send astronauts there like a pitstop, before they continue their journey to Mars. Thats one of NASAs long term plan and Artemis project. As of now, they no longer have debts and theyre profitable. The company only went listed last year in 2023, so were actually in the very early stages like how Amazon started. This could huge in the future, like a decade from now when space is the next frontier."

I graduated with a focus in propulsion engineering from the Prescott Arizona campus the one that actually made money while Daytona gets all the nice things. For context my jet propulsion professor literally wrote the book on modern airbreathing jet propulsion. My space propulsion professor was heavily involved with the Air Force during the fun cold war years. My controls professor worked for skunkworks and is why the f35 can do the freaky hovermode shit that it does. Im stuck in IT now and getting by but Ive been told by the old engineer guards that if I could get into a defense firm Id be one of the best engineers around. Life had other opinions sadly. Knowing what I know about LUNR now Im tempted to throw a resume at them for some sort of work and see what happens lol My grad project was hypersonics and I found a way to make airbreathing long range hypersonics viable but impractical. The company we worked with fucked up the test model but the backup model we rigged and used nondimensionalized figures showed the math worked and you can make an airbreathing missile travel at near ICBM range limits as in across the entire United States in 40 minutes in stml using fuel from the cold war all while hitting mach 5 or higher. Current ICBMs cannot do this as they go into space to have their ranges. The tech I made could potentially extend that too. Its just stupidly expensive to do but you can do it and prior to that people thought it was impossible from a heat control standpoint. I figured out how to cool the missile and get more mpg out of the fuel at the same time. You see similar cooling nowadays in the bell nozzles of rockets but I got it to work for aircraft and missile skins. Im sure if anyone knows my project on here I just doxxed myself hard lmao. Not like the shit is secret. Raytheon wanted to get me to do intern work with them on their recently announced supersonic glide vehicles since I made a design that was man carryable, and only needed an air balloon to get enough speed to blow up a building on kinetic impact. Cheaper than a hellfire too"

When expectations are this high, any disappointment, even if minor, can lead to a significant drop in the stock price. If earnings or guidance fall short of what the market expects, the stock could drop, making a long put profitable. 2. Elevated Valuations NVIDIAs stock has often traded at high valuations relative to its earnings and revenue. If investors start to believe that these valuations are too stretched, especially in the face of any potential slowdown in growth or broader economic concerns, the stock could see a significant decline. A long put would benefit from this scenario. 3. PostEarnings Volatility Even when companies report strong earnings, the market can sometimes react negatively, especially if there are concerns about future growth, increasing costs, or potential competition. With options, you can benefit from the increased volatility that often follows earnings reports. If the stock drops even slightly, a long put could gain value quickly. 4. SectorWide Risks The technology sector, particularly companies like NVIDIA, can be sensitive to broader economic conditions, such as rising interest rates or inflation. If theres a sectorwide downturn or if tech stocks are under pressure due to macroeconomic concerns, NVIDIAs stock could decline, making a long put an attractive play. 5. Risk of Guidance Cuts or Conservative Outlook Even if NVIDIA reports strong current earnings, the company might issue conservative guidance due to uncertainties in the global economy, competition, or potential supply chain issues. The market often reacts negatively to such guidance, which could drive the stock lower and make a long put a winning bet. Therefore I will be inversing OP"

Heres a breakdown of the points youve mentioned, along with some additional thoughts 1. Surging Demand for AI Chips The demand for AI and machine learning technologies is indeed a significant growth driver for NVIDIA. Their leadership in the AI chip market, particularly with the A100 and H100 GPUs, positions them well to capture a substantial share of the increasing investments in AI. This trend is likely to continue as AI becomes more integral across industries. 2. Data Center Growth NVIDIAs data center business is a crucial revenue stream, and as AI adoption accelerates, the demand for their GPUs in cloud computing and AI workloads will likely increase. This segment is a critical area to watch, as it could continue to drive NVIDIAs growth beyond Q2. 3. Gaming Sector Resilience Despite challenges in the broader tech sector, NVIDIAs gaming segment remains robust. The gaming markets demand for highperformance GPUs ensures steady revenue, and NVIDIAs strong brand loyalty among gamers helps maintain this segments stability. 4. Strategic Partnerships and Expansions NVIDIAs strategic moves into markets like automotive and edge computing diversify its revenue streams and reduce reliance on any single segment. These expansions also open up new growth avenues, particularly as industries like automotive increasingly adopt AI technologies. 5. Product Innovations NVIDIAs commitment to innovation, particularly in developing GPUs tailored for AI and professional visualization, keeps them ahead of competitors. The ability to command higher average selling prices and maintain strong margins is a testament to their competitive advantage. 6. Supply Chain Management Effective supply chain management has been crucial in an industry where many companies have struggled. NVIDIAs ability to meet high demand while navigating supply chain challenges is a significant competitive edge, ensuring they can capitalize on market opportunities. Regarding your point about current estimates not accounting for operating leverage, this is an insightful observation. If NVIDIA can achieve greater operating leverage as revenue scales, this could lead to higher profitability than currently anticipated, potentially driving the stock into the 140145 range by the end of the year. However, this would also depend on broader market conditions, the continued strength of their core segments, and how well they manage any macroeconomic headwinds. Overall, NVIDIA appears wellpositioned to deliver strong Q2 earnings, and your analysis captures the essential factors that could drive this outcome."

However, I do think the next few months will be volatile, and there might be a lower bottom coming, maybe below 5k, depending on news, rates, inflation etc. I also believe the market will do very well after the election, maybe a little sooner, but thats still a ways off, and could change, but thats usually how things work.

Well, the big loan buyers Lehman Brothers amongst many others were offering disastrously dangerous loan products. For example, someone with a 580 credit score could borrower up to 95, cash out, on the value of their home AND state their income! And the cherry on top was that most were adjustable rate loans. Well, that set the stage for 2008 as they were bundling these risky loans into mortgage backed securities MBS that were supposed to be lighter risk. They werent at all. Then the perfect storm hits with 911. Recession, then comes the defaults. On a MASSIVE scale. Those loans, for the most part, are not prevalent in the market these days. This scenario we are in is also a possible perfect storm. Years of robust growth and cheap money got an entire generation spending like it was going to last forever. Here we are now. 8 trillion in debt heavier, the middle class making generally the same amount but inflation out of this world. And when you hear CPI 3 YOY you know better than that. How much did you pay for those groceries in 2019? How about that car? Or services? Now what is actual inflation? Not 3. And those trusted brands you buy....well, you are still buying them.....but getting less for the same price. Stagflation is the word. The corporations are showing record profits. How??? Thats how. Do some research on how we got out of the 2008 recession. It was actually the middle class that didnt really have the money kept spending. THAT group got us out of that one while the big dogs sat on the sideline with huge amounts of cash. They won big then and are winning big now and will win big again if we do slip into an official recession."

Its not the first time people have tried to corner a gemstone market, most fail, government regulated supply is a weak hold and product moves through with the correct connections and money. Blue Zircon can be found in many localities and white zircon can be treated. The price and comparison should also be measured against a basket of similar gem material which you will find a similar trend in pricing that many mid tier gems have moved up in value over the last several years. This last year in Tucson anecdotal discussions with gem dealers and purchasers indicated some level of inverse pricing from mine to consumers, it was more expensive material at the mine source than what was being sold in Tucson, mainly due to cash buyers paying premiums for large lots at the source. The price to reach 10K per carat is unrealistic in a lifetime term. This material is just not that rare to reach high grade ruby and sapphire pricing. if you can get 300 you are good, if you get 500 for high quality large pieces great, but the average is lower and there is a lot of material that is treated flooding the market some show up directly at the mines. A good resource on pricing and markets is GIA field Gemologist Wim Vertriest who has written many articles on sourcing stones and the market in general and has a large focus in SE Asian markets. Separately if you are looking to have large high quality pieces cut please reach out, I have some experience in faceting"

Their hardness is a 6 on a scale of 10, where diamonds are a 10. The reason ppl can wear diamonds on their fingers is bc they dont chip when abused. Theres also the fact that actual big money can just reopen mines at scale if these were to ever actually appreciate substantially in value, which they wont, because they suck as precious stones and dont have any industrial use. No one cares about how old and sparkly they are if they cant be effectively cut into a particular shape because theyre prone to shattering first.. Also, the math isnt even correct. 1m carats at 10ea is 10m, not 250k. Also, current price per carat appears to be nowhere near 150300 after a brief google search. Also, OP appears to be trying to spin this investment failure into an even farther fetched plan by creating a crypto token and tokenizing blue zircon into a realworldasset... but its already a real world asset, just not one that anyone wants. Also, Ill admit I am jealous though of OPs access to mommy and daddys money and his unlimited free time to spend 5 years chasing such a thoroughly halfbaked idea. Well, at least he has an interest in something, honey, thats all we can ask for... sigh This is worse than nanas money going to intel.

He bought the whole lot from us for around 10k dollars. We went back out and mined another 200 or so lbs but when we reached back out the broker told us hed sold roughly 100 lbs of our first find before the market collapsed.

Ive seen some wild things while traveling in that circle of high end gem and mineral dealing. In Colorado for example, where weed is legal but the banks wont touch it, Ive seen people come in and drop 30k, 50k etc. in cash on a single tourmaline, with the intent to resell it at some point as a way to legitimize their capital. We call them Wookiees because theyre typically very hairy, and dont bathe much. Then theres the oil and gas geologists who have absurd amounts of money but dress like theyre in between hikes. Theres the HealyFealys who believe the crystals have some sort of magical properties. How they pick a rock thatll increase their Luck, or Prosperity, or bolster their love life is anyones guess. Then youve got the standard investors who are looking to diversify their wealth into collectible class assets or Asset Class Collectibles Ive heard both used. Theyre looking for something they can park their money in and resell for a profit later. You also get just collectors. People whose rock collection went way beyond what you could even fathom as a kid picking cool rocks out of a garden bed. Ive seen some specimens change hands for 7 figures or more.

A lot of people say dont recommend emerald for a daily wear ring or engagement ring as can get scratched and damaged. So ..it is more preferred corundum stones and diamond for that. There are also a lot of advancements in synthetic diamonds happening now first mostly yellow, but also blue diamonds might be created. Sapphire the most famous blue stone can already be created synthetically and blue topaz as well is relatively affordable just from natural sources and a fair amount of good color tanzanite floating around. There are some that like collecting niche gemstones but that is a small part of the market compared to the jewelry industry. The name..is also a problem in that it has nothing to do with cubic zirconia, but the name zircon sounds similar so peoples perception it is a synthetic or low cost gemstone. But one of its biggest flaws in use in jewelry is that exposure to UV can turn blue zircon into an unappealing brown. That is the main reason it has not been widely adopted for jewelry. Almost a similar problem to welo opal that turns dull and yellow over time. Apatite...another blue stone that has a lovely shade can also fade and change color with UV exposure."

What your fighting right now is a global move to lab grown stones. You took a huge gamble with your investment and you do have considerable profit even if you liquidate now based on your numbers. I would look to partner with a manufacturer and begin to make peace with your investment. Its easy to get overwhelmed with facts and figures, you did well. You state average cost at 10carat with a current price of 100150carat thats a serious gain. However what your dealing with now is beanie babies in the 90s. Will it skyrocket in the next years and keep adding value or will people just stop caring? I wish you good luck in your future, I am jealous as zircon is a stone Ive not got to add to my collection.

Zircons in general, because of their small Uranium content, are used in Geology to date the rocks they are in using the UPb dating method. So they found some inherited small zircons in an Australian conglomerate that were 4.4 Ga years old. those are neither blue though nor do they have anything to do with OPs zircons. OPs zircons are less than 1 million year old and therefore very young certainly much much younger than any diamonds. In fact, you would never find natural i.e. not heat treated old, gemquality zircons. The radioactive elements in them mainly U and Th decay over time and slowly destroy the crystal lattice. All old zircons will therefore look somewhat eaten up. Blue Zircons are also neither rare nor even natural. The blue color is achieved by heating gemquality zircons which are usually yellow or orange up to about 1000degC. Zircons themselves are not rare at all either, almost every rock has some in them. Even large gemquality specimens are relatively common. Thats why you can get them for literally pennies on the internet."

Using diamond as thats the only other jewellery stone I know that has this value per carat The hardness of zircon is far far less than diamond at c6.5, this is a serious factor in pricing a gemstone. You say that the mines in Cambodia were closing but youve also got Sri Lanka and Australia which have huge reserves of zircon. Which I guess would make up the shortfall from Cambodia? The 10k you mentioned, I assume thats in gem format not rough or facet ready? Honestly theres a tonne here Im struggling with BUT I hope, for your sake, Im completely wrong and it goes to 10k!"

Weve also been able to grow and mass produce zirconscubic zirconia in a laboratory setting, which requires no slave labor, for decades now, and its becoming cheaper and more efficient year after year. There are also multiple other gemstones with similar visual qualities that are much more suitable for jewelry applications and are much cheaper, like moissanite and blue topaz. The extra stupid part of this is that there are plenty of gemstonesminerals which actually have the increasing scarcity that OP is looking for. Turquoise is a great example. It is a relatively rare semiprecious gemstone with only a handful of mines producing it in any significant quantity worldwide. Most of what you see labeled as turquoise on the market now is actually cheaper and more common stones marketed as turquoise because of how scarce real turquoise is becoming. Its basically only found in great quantities in the American southwest and the mines in the southwest have been running dry and falling short of demand for quite a while. In conclusion, I have a bachelors degree in why OP is dumb soon to be a masters!."

The age of other zircons you dont own are as relevant to the value of your zircons as the fact knives being 2.5 million years old affect the value of cutlery at IKEA. Zircon from Ratanakiri Province, northeastern Cambodia, is well known in the gem trade for its vivid blue colour that results from heat treatment. The untreated brown material turns blue under reducing conditions at 9001,000degC. Ratanakiri zircon is characterised by remarkably low contents of trace elements. In particular, the actinides have low concentrations e.g. approximately 120 ppm U and 95 ppm Th. Together with the very young age of the zircon 1 million years Ma... Blue zircons are also heat treated to give them their colour, which greatly diminishes the value of gemstones. Youre better off buying an artificial zircon. Theyre cheaper and more ethical."

You charge 40 more for organic lemons, 50 more for conflictfree lemons. You pack the Capitol with lemon lobbyists, you get a Kardashian to suck a lemon wedge in a leaked sex tape. Timothee Chalamet wears lemon shoes at Cannes. Get a hashtag campaign. Something isnt cool or tight or awesome, no, its lemon. Did you see that movie? Did you see that concert? It was effing lemon. Billie Eilish, OMG, hashtag... lemon. You get Dr. Oz to recommend four lemons a day and a lemon suppository supplement to get rid of toxins cause theres nothing scarier than toxins. Then you patent the seeds. You write a line of genetic code that makes the lemons look just a little more like tits... and you get a gene patent for the titlemon DNA sequence, you crosspollinate... you get those seeds circulating in the wild, and then you sue the farmer for copyright infringement when that genetic code shows up on their land.

We spent about 34 hrs hiking around the desert every Sunday afternoon for 6 weeks to come up with those rocks.

The color is breathtaking, moreso than any sapphire Ive seen tbh. I love rockhounding for it and am working on getting one faceted for my wedding ring.

Even Forever diamond which are marked engraved are only marked past a certain point in the chain and the true origin cant be known for sure. So basically, my take away from that conversation intended to convince me to not care about the issue was that lab grown diamonds are a better quality anyway, cheaper, and thats a nice way to vote with your money."

Moved to Uruguay to start beekeeping and got in trouble for importing invasive bees. Ran away to Seattle, worked at Trader Joes, stole pancake mix and tried to sell it before getting fired. Moved back to Oklahoma, tried to buy a huge ant farm located in the PNW to use them for random number generation to sell it to companies. Also was wondering if Ants eat gourds because hes apparently growing them now LOL Couldnt afford the trip to get the ant farm normally plus found out it was illegal to transport queen ants across state lines, somehow ended up in Mexico on the way and losing his passport lol. Ended up in Turkey learning how to juggle ice cream. Tried to start Turkish ice cream business in Oklahoma but couldnt afford it, so he attempted to illegally start his business in the Netherlands with no money or work visa. Asked people if the Turkish government would pay for him to spread Turkish culture to other countries through his ice cream business Hes banned from travel in the EU.

If you own 100 shares you can sell a covered call, but if you want to sell covered puts you need to short the stock, because the buyer of the put has the right to sell shares to you, meaning you have to buy their shares. You can only cover this with a short position since when you short a stock you borrow and sell it first and buy it later and give back the borrowed shares. You mentioned that if you sell a call and the buyer of the call exercises the call, you give away your shares for nothing. That is not true and Im curious where you got that info from honest question. When you write a call the buyer of the call has the right to buy 100 shares from you at the strike price. That means that if the buyer exercises his right, you have to sell 100 shares in exchange for the strike price. In other words, if the strike price is 30 and the buyer exercises the call, you sell him your 100 shares for 100 x 30 3,000."

Instead of expecting AI to double earnings estimates with cartoonish ROI, which is what a lot of people apparently expected and now theyre yammering about the bubble bursting, what wed probably realistically expect to see is what were seeing continued respectable growth and earnings but with fewer IT workers.

Turns out she spent 1400 in 10 dollar increments on flare Called Apple and contested the charges, and Apple told me to pound sand. Escalated it, and Apple again told me to F off. They were emailing purchase confirmations to my 8 year olds email account. She doesnt check email. Finally contested those charges with my CC, and was refunded. In conclusion, fuck Roblox.
