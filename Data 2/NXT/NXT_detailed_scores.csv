Reddit,2024-10-13,"A CSuite SVP. As leavings go. Id say he will be missed and is leaving on great terms. From LinkedIN ARCHERS ASSEMBLE without me.After almost exactly 3 years at Archer I have decided to move on.When I joined Archer after a few coffee chats with Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein and some insight into what they were up for, the company was in a quite early stage. The powertrain team that I took over was less than 15 people. We used mainly off the shelf components, motors, inverters and battery cells from prototype vendors.Fast forward to 2024, the powertrain team is more than 150 people in total. Alex Clarabut leading battery, Dillon Thomasson drive units, Stephen Spiteri power electronics and Paul Frihauf leading BMS to name just a few. All rockstars in their fields of expertise. For sure the best team in the hashtagevtol industry. And one of the best in the whole ,,electric transportation of any kind industry.We have designed and validated our own motors, inverters, batteries and battery management systems. Hardware, controls, software, system integration we did it. We have established a close development and commercial cooperation with our battery cell supplier Molicell. We have established close collaboration with the Stellantis engineering community Ned Curic Michael Bly other words Powertrain is set up for success and a safe launch.On the manufacturing side it was pretty clear that no existing supplier could give us what we need the combination of aviation certified manufacturing and leading edge EV craftsmanship. So we designed our own scaleable manufacturing system. And built it. And brought it up. And it runs very well. Kudos to Isaac Harper and Heath Smoot team is set up so well that they will be just fine without me. Which I consider the ultimate goal of a leader built a team that is so good that they can do great without you. YOU GOT THIS, ARCHER POWERTRAIN TEAM!!! So for me its time to move on. I have not 100 decided yet what to do next. It will for sure be in the ,,electrification space. The intention is also to revive my European roots and at least have one leg in Germany. Germany treated and educated me very well kudos to my Alma Mater Ruhr University Bochum I am very excited about the next weeks and months and about the choices and decisions to be made.

While they are waiting for certifications in the U.S. launch where you can. The UAE will take cues from the FAA in how Archer is progressing so those milestones will still have to be met.

Reddit,2024-09-13,"This is only true for home solutions, which is more politically sensitive. For utility level solar, solar farms are proving themselves as reliable and extremely low upkeep cost at the same time as manufacturing them is getting incredibly cheap. Global installed solar capacity has been growing literally exponentially, doubling every 3 years. The more panels that are manufactured, the more economies of scale kick in, and it becomes even cheaper to make, making even not so sunny places cost effective for solar, even in the absence of sufficient grid level storage mechanisms. Which are also developing fast, just not exponentially like solar. In 10 years, solar will be the largest source of electrical power on the planet. Energy produced by them will cost less than half as much as the cheapest electricity to produce today. No politician can deny reality in the long term, as republicans are finding out as people whose homes are destroyed by flooding in the SE US are more likely to believe in climate change regardless of political leaning. Solar is going to be a huge part of the future, and most people dont see it yet. Of course having said this, many of the factors I just named mean that actual margins in the industry will probably go pretty low in the long term, and its going to be essentially impossible to establish a moat.

Of course I may be missing something, but I think there are a few key points that make NXT more attractive as an investment than the stock price and solar-focus would suggest:Unlike most companies in the solar industry (panel manufacturers, developers), Nextracker generates strong cash flow and has postive operating leverage. This is because they are capital light and have market leadership in their product category. They use a contract manufacturing model with domestic partners. Check their cash flow statement - they have basically no capex, very little working capital needs, and paying down debt. They recently aquired Ojjo and Solar Pile International, which adds new patents, automated machinery tech, and diversified foundation solutions to their product portfolio. They completed these acquisitions without debt or dilution, with over $100M of operating cashflow left over for the quarter and no material change to their $400M cash pile. They are growing revenues while their key competitors are losing market share. All of this makes NXT a much different renewable play than module producers or project developers, who operate capital intensive, commoditized, and deflationary business models.",Positive,1,0.9999979734420776,Main

ARRY The trailing PE ratio is 61.09 and the forward PE ratio is 8.17. ARRY&#39;s PEG ratio is 0.77.

ARRY : PE Ratio 61.09 Forward PE 8.17 PS Ratio 0.88 Forward PS 0.69 PB Ratio 4.87 P/FCF Ratio 4.75 PEG Ratio 0.77
