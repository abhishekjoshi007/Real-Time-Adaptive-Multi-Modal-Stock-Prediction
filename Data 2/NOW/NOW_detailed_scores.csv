Yahoo,2024-10-25,"Do you remember the clone analyst who downgraded the company by arguing, ‘I doubt that this company will ever be able to utilize and generate profit using AI’? He caused the stock to drop by around 12% that day. I wrote back then that NOW is defined as a standard. Whenever I talk to my enterprise customers, they ask me about integrations with their ITSM, and the vendors on the other side focus heavily on making integrations possible by using NOW as a standard. Vendors say, yes we have a native integration with NOW. There is no system of judgment to ask these kinds of unprofessional analyst, who don&#39;t know about the industry. They cover the whole Tech. They don&#39;t know that the Tech is huge, you cant cover them. I am a cybersecurity architect. I can only cover companies in my area and still there are companies I really cant analyze and judge.",Neutral,0,0.9940565824508667,Main

So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on NOW stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on NOW stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.

It brought it to -12 the next day. A very good opp. to buy. I am not in this stock anymore, but would jump sometime around Nov again. But I am sure this is a great company in its field and it is recently interpreted as a de-facto for the ITSM.
