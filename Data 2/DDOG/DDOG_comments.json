First, are you adding the news into your post because those things might affect your trade movements today? Naturally current events affect the stock market, but I am particularly curious about your choice to put Trumps possible VP change in bold. Do you believe that this decision would have a significant impact on the market and, if so, in what way? Where do you get the data regarding expected revenue, reported earnings, etc? Does you list of closely monitored stocks change frequently, or is this a pretty consistent grouping for you? To be honest, I dont fully understand the implications of your past job. I googled what a prop shop is, but am still curious, from your experience, what is the biggest takeaway you learned about the stock market? I appreciate you sharing you insights!"

The ones worth trading typically but not always do. I believe that Trumps pick will up his chances of winning the election in the same way that Biden stepping down upped the chance of the Democrats winning the election with Kamala. And yes, I believe that there will be some market movement as a result DJT the stock could go up if his VP pick is better than Vance, there could be more volatility depending on the candidate, the VP pick could have a historical precedent of being friendly towards certain industries, etc. Worth looking at charts of the market after Biden announced he was stepping down, and after the Trump assassination attempt which boosted Trumps chances of winning the election The earnings reports are pretty much reported internet wide, just do a Google search and youll be able to find it pretty quickly. Id say it depends the past week has been crazy so there are specific stocks that have been more interesting than others semis, volatility, levered ETFs, but on a normal day it should change depending on what stocks have meaningful news I post daily so you can reference my old posts in rstocks as well. Biggest takeaway is that it is possible to beat the market, but the dedication and hard work you need to put in will genuinely be the hardest thing you do, and you need to keep putting in the effort. My mentor at the prop shop is someone I think who would have been a Michael Phelpslevel Olympian if he had better physical genetics, alas he had to settle for being one of the greatest day traders in America lol. I make this watchlist daily and share it because I like to keep current with the market, because Ill never have the discipline that he does."

You are throwing away potentially millions of dollars if you take on longdated debt right now. It makes infinitely more sense to skip the middleman at that point. Yes stocks are forward looking, but the valuation that ASTS is trading at is MASSIVELY optimistic. Could I be wrong about an offering? Absolutely, but saying that 3 month old news isnt priced into a stock is very unlikely, especially with how well known ASTS is and it having tripled since the announcement. The market doesnt collectively say wow we forgot that ASTS is going to receive more revenue from one of its major contracts and then buy more three months after it was signed. Sidenote You dont NEED to have a pressing need to have cash to do an offering GME was operating completely fine as a company before they announced the massive dilution 2 months ago, the stock was just trading at premium."

I cant predict the future and say Theyre going to sign a 1 billion dollar contract with SpaceX!!! because thats just illogical and insider trading. Offerings are significantly easier to anticipate. There is a point where an offering becomes a logical thing to do, like when GME mgmt did an offering when it was trading around 60 a few months back. Do I think the stock price is overvalued? Absolutely! Could I be wrong? Absolutely lol. i feel like youre describing a trading strategy where retailinstitutions trade on news beats a quarter at a time and you can measure the sustainability by the multiples of the share price? is that what you do? Regarding this, thats not what I do lol. At the end of the day its a stock Im interested in potentially watching and Im listing the reason for why Im watching it. Trading is about having a bias, and thats my bias. I could go long at some point as well if my bias changes. Short from 22 btw. At the end of the day both of us can be right they can do an offering and the market can think theyre going to go higher and the price can skyrocket past that. Its not a big deal lol."
