Reddit,2024-09-01,I have both. Its no big deal wit move stuff to sgov or usfr with free trades. I prefer tos. But I dont trade much anymore. Fidelity does dumb crap where you need like 1 million to trade zero day options. Tda basically banned trading on options of gme and AMC. You couldnt sell covered calls or cash backed puts with the ap. You had to call in and phone trade. Fidelity and Vanguard I think are the only 2 that didnt cut off options trading. Vanguard is no leveraged or crypto. Fidelity also no futures. I keep a couple of accounts due to potential fraud or and or systems crashing. Once I retire I dont want to risk having one get cut off for whatever reason.

Reddit,2024-09-01,"I agree with you about Schwabs app being glitchy. I have given up trying to do any trades on the app and only use it to do research. I only trade on PC because Schwabs app will just freeze up every time I try to do a trade on my phone. Also Schwab has locked people out of their accounts twice this year already which never happened to me before on any other brokerage. The only reason I am using Schwab is because I really liked TD Ameritrade and they were purchased by Schwab this year so I didnt really have a choice. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and you can still use the ThinkorSwim platform with Schwab so that is something that I dont want to give up. I am crossing my fingers hoping they will get better because I would really rather avoid switching brokerages and having to learn a new skill set for trading. If I were to move I might choose Chase, but I have heard that Fidelity is also a good choice. Good luck with whatever you decide! Edit I wanted to add that another thing I do like about Schwab is that you can trade in afterhours premarket, set up as many automatic orders as you want with no fees for equity tradesnot options, and I can spend twice as much money as I actually have if I want to not sure if that is a good thing or not...lol.",Neutral,0,0.9927638173103333,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-01,"I have accounts at both. I was switched to Schwab when they bought TD Ameritrade. After the switch, I was extremely disappointed with Schwab performance. Here are the things I did not like versus Fidelity 1 Fidelity auto sweeps my cash to a money market account paying 5. Schwab does not and pays a paltry 0.35 on this cash. 2 Fidelity pays out dividends to customers the same day companies pay out. Schwab holds this cash for an extra day and pays out a day later. 3 Schwabs site experienced 3 crashes at the open when I was looking to trade. Never had a problem with Fidelity in the 10 years I have had an account with them. 4 My account contacts at Fidelity are great and take care of things within days of requesting. My account rep at TD Ameritrade was awesome and moved over to Schwab. He is super frustrated by them due to their poor performance and inability to compete with other brokerage firms as they are not competitive. 5 Schwab only allows a single phone number for two factor authentication. Fidelity allows two phone numbers to be set up to access an account via two factor authentication. I want both my wife and myself to be able to access accounts in case something happens to the other spouse. I ended up moving a multimillion account from Schwab to Fidelity due to Schwabs poor performance. Fidelity paid me an incentive bonus of several thousand dollars to move the money to them.

If they are fiduciaries lordy, I hope so for those rates then you already have someone you can talk to about this. Also, I understand the desire to minimize taxes, but remember that someone is going to pay taxes on that money in CB at some point. If you move it to a Roth, then its already taxed and she or her heirs can pull it taxfree. AND its not subject to RMDs. It might be reasonable to just do a Roth conversion for the CB money or several over a couple years depending on where she is in the tax and IRMAA brackets. Max out the tax bracket shes in and you can probably convert in a couple years without triggering unnecessary taxes or and IRMAA cliff.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"She has to take out a few thousand every year bc shes over a certain age. Youre describing RMD required minimum distribution, from a retirement account? Yes, the government requires this and provides the table for how much to take, based on the FMV of the accounts at prior year end and the persons age, which I dont see where you told us this important piece of information. but I also dont want her to have to pay 20 tax on the money right away. Anything that is removed from a taxable retirement account, such as Trad IRA or 401k, is taxable as ordinary income. It may or may not be 20. There is withholding, which is deducted at the time of the distribution, for retirement accounts. Thats likely the 20 you mention, which is not Taxes. Its a prepayment against her 1040. a big chunk in a vanguard 20 and then I invested the other 19. Vanguard is a brokerage. Which funds? Invested the other 19 in what? A perspective of the mix helps. Shes a single, widow, head of household thats old enough to hit any qualifier for tax stuff. Shes retired. The 5y rule wouldnt apply to her, I know that. Yes, there are a number of 5year rules for Roth. Yes, the accountbased Roth IRA fiveyear rule says you cannot withdraw earnings taxfree until its been at least five years since you first contributed to a Roth IRA account. This fiveyear rule applies to everyone who contributes to a Roth IRA, whether theyre 59 12 or 105 years old. It will depend, then, and when she takes funds and how much as compared to her basis. From Yes, another Roth 5year rule is for conversions. Each carries its own 5year clock. She wont be subject to this rule. ideally some kind of welcome bonus even if its 150200 bucks You dont need a Bonus for retirement investing. You dont need to work on incentives. You just need to work on being helpful and getting her some lower risk with better performance. It isnt clear if CB is holding annuities for this person. That one of the investment types, and not an account, and thats why it matters to note the holdings. Yes, you would talk to the ED Jones person, but they are paid advisor group. You also can Rollover a Trad IRA to a Vanguard IRA this means Account and then investreinvest the holdings. You can do a direct trusteetotrustee transfer for the holdings, often in kind from a Trad IRA to a Roth IRA, but that is a taxable conversion. I do not recommend conversions unless the person is under 70 or really wont touch this money for 1015 years. Thats because they are already taking RMDs and paying taxes, so moving it and paying taxes, then needing to take some as distributions anyway, just churned their account a bit. And as pointed out, watch her income tax bracket, for triggering IRMAA. Thats an expensive lesson.",Neutral,0,0.9999721050262451,Reply

I appreciate all of the advice Ive gotten from the few subs Ive posted this in, really been a big help. Ive objectively been a positive benefit on her finances and not getting scammed, I was literally at her house when she was about to get scammed for who knows how much...her friend got taken for her savings which is awful. She was mid download of a remote control phone app, no joke. But I know what I know, and I know what Im absolutely fucking clueless about. At least thats what my therapist says, just in a much softer tone. It was one thing to get from some savings account paying her 0.05 APY that she NEVER touched in to a HYSA. That was even pulling teeth tbh, took months before she agreed, but shes been super open with me and now thinks I know way more than I do lol. Shes also getting more forgetful which is rough to see, and her sons arent around as much as they should be. Shes basically been my mother, I lost mine at 13, dad not long after and she was always there. So I want to be there for her. Ive already talked to a couple places for free and gotten some solid info. Still in very early stages of this, I want to have her sit down with a financial advisor at least once with regards to this account. She seems open to it, she wants me there which is fine. I want to make sure I find the right one, and shes the busiest person her age Ive ever seen lol. Im in no rush though, I want to make that very clear. Shes in the middle of switching CPAs as well, the one she had for 25y retired and she simply just kept going to whoever took over the place. Since then, shes had to pay late fees to the IRS 23 years... albeit very minor, like low 3 figures minor, but still which is ridiculous. No issues like that for 25y, then in the 3y shes been with this new guy there was a mess up like that twice?

I cant believe you didnt know that... its literally one of the most basic facts about their business.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"What I found so crazy about all of that was just the lack of understanding of how expensive it is to produce an entirely new vehicle. The major auto makers would often collaborate or at a minimum share parts between platforms to reduce the cost. The first Tesla wasnt even really bespoke, it was a modified Lotus with bespoke body panels. Tesla was unprofitable for a long time, and also only got over their initial first delivery hump because of a DOE grant that was part of an Obama administration sustainable energy program. And they still didnt turn a profit for years. It takes a long time to get a reactor built. New designs take a long time to be reviewed and approved, and for good reason. If something goes sideways it can have catastrophic impacts to health and safety. It takes years to get a plant built as it goes through the community planning process. And in all that time that it takes to get it up and running there is a lot of room for people to be taken by the next great thing. True advances in any technology are great, and a lot of people recognize the issue of climate change and how power hungry data centers are. But advances in technology also mean more efficient use of power and materials to do the same thing. For me that is how companies really separate themselves from the pack, if theyre coming up with a more efficient product, running their operations more efficiently, truly innovating and rapidly meeting a need. I dont see nuclear doing that soon.",Negative,-1,0.5141626000404358,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-19,"Hi, I think that an important distinction has to be done between nuclear and uranium Nuclear stocks are companies that build reactors. Uranium stocks are companies actif in the fuel of reactors I think indeed that investing in nuclear stocks is much more risky than investing in uranium producers. Nuclear stocks in the West have a lot to study, to reinvent. In China, India, Russia reactors are build on time and close to budget. And they finish a lot of new reactors each year! In the West we had that in the 80ties and 90ties. But now the West lost that, and has to reinvent that level of nuclear reactor construction. Uranium producers or near term producers well advanced developers on the other hand have a very bright future The uranium sector is in a structural growing supply deficit that cant be solved in a couple years time The near term producers, like Peninsula Energy, Lotus Resources, Global Atomic, and smaller uranium producers steadily increasing production, like EnCore Energy, Uranium Energy Corp, Denison Mines, will greatly benefit from this structural shortage, but they are too small to solve that global uranium supply shortage. Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell. And the less they deliver to clients utilities, the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket directly. There is no way around this. Producers andor clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket. And that while uranium demand is price INelastic! And before that announcement in August 2024 of Kazakhstan that they will produce 17 less in 2025 than previously promised, the global uranium supply problem looked like this Source Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world Kazakhstan represents 45 of world uranium production.

The latter 3 have almost no liquidity so be careful. ccj is the largest Western 2nd overall producer of uranium. They own half of Westinghouse which designs nuclear reactors and also working on SMRs. sruuf is a spot uranium trust. Ive been buying more whenever it trades at a discount to NAV of 15. SMRs will be a working product, as they are basically just smaller versions of the big ones we have. Im specifically talking about the water cooling ones. We already have small nuclear reactors in submarines and aircraft carriers. The main issue is probably going to be an economic one. Regulation is still expensive, still take a long time to get approved, and they dont have economy of scale as they are producing less energy. Their argument is prices will go down because it will take less time to build and government red tape will be easier to navigate for smaller builds. They can build it directly next to a data center and sell directly to tech companies. SMRs will likely be a thing, we just dont know which design will be the Tesla.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"Working in the nuclear sector I think people underestimate the cost aspect and the time the design process takes. From my time working at CPNPP, the plant first ran in the 90s, the majority of equipment approved for the build was built in the 70s. When I was there in 2016 time frame we had a DOS based plc hooked to fax machine that printed out every line of code in the plant line by line just like in the Simpsons an it was so outdated we had to 3D print our parts to rebuild the fax machine. lol The maintenance teams are great at making old shit work. In the 70s it took them 16 years to build and 11 billion roughly spent. In 2016 the two reactors produced roughly 3 million in profit a day 1.5m per reactor no telling what that is now or what that was 20 years ago. CPNPP averaged roughly 6 of Texas produced energy with its two reactors. Nuclear Power has a bell curve to be profitable and provide clean energy for decades. UAEs 4 reactor Barakah plant is a great representation of this however, the US private sector relies heavily on the government whom is currently afraid to take a risk on nuclear and they have been steadily declining to do so for years.

Still makes it all a huge gamble that more likely than not will be subject to people trying to wheel the hype, pump and dump, or just get stuck holding a bag until any doors open and power starts to flow and then who knows what the businesses profitability actually looks like. And yeah, the industry was dying. A few years ago a handful of startups, some US based, some based out of China, some elsewhere, were offering varying reimaginings of nuclear power stations, in part I think because of this looming problem of many reactors approaching end of life. Then came the social media pushes, then successful lobbying at COP28. People seemed most excited about reactors that recycle the waste. They still produce waste, and once we run out of the waste thats been generated from traditional reactors theyll have to feed them with fresh material. The reactor material its self also ultimately becomes radiated and starts to break down overtime, and that is part of the waste, not just the spent fuel. When nuclear powered submarines and ships are decommissioned they have to just cut out the section of the ship with the reactor in it because they cant recycle all the irradiated material.",Neutral,0,0.8794004321098328,Reply

This is now being done by coal and gas, which in time, must go Furthermore i dont think you are understanding the issues coming from especially solar generation. Western Europe has shifted from a centralized energy production to decentralized. However, to the nature of how people live this is absolutely terrible. The main problems stems from the fact that people in the country side have huge houses and a LOT of solar capacity that must be used by people in the city. The grid is simply not designed for this. Already you now must PAY to get your extra solar power on the grid as nobody wants it. Sounds good? No because solar now pretty much has an infinite payback time. The baseload however has never seen a negative price. In addition, you cant run a country on purely renewables without storage, you need a reliable baseload, you know, the whole duck curve problem. For most of Europe storage is impossible. Also again, your reasoning is flawed. Yes renewables are cheaper per kWh, however you simply must add the extra grid cost to renewables. For the Netherlands this lays at 200 billion. Renewables then suddenly go from the cheapest to most expensive form of electricity generation. This is well known, renewables are absolutely fantastic in small quantities, terrible in big amounts. You are welcome to take a look here, the country with the highest percentage of solar and one of the highest with wind in its grid and per capita. Literally everything is breaking because of it, its seriously not funny anymore. Houses cant be build because they cant get connected, schools cant get connected, businesses cant het connected and we currently pay some of or depending on the sector, the highest rates for our energy. I really dont think you understand the effect of such a large amount of renewables has, it breaks everything Edit some more numbers for you, on 14 oktober, not even in the summer. The solar production went from 13 GW to 2 GW in 1 hour. The total Dutch consumption at that time was about 17 GW. Some more numbers for you on 20 september, the solar production had to shut down over 40 of its capacity due to oversupply.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"Nuclear can, and must, run 247 to keep te grid stable and prevent brownouts. This is now being done by coal and gas, which in time, must go Why? Grid forming inverters and synchronous condensers have already fixed the grid strength issues in numerous grids. The main problems stems from the fact that people in the country side have huge houses and a LOT of solar capacity that must be used by people in the city. The grid is simply not designed for this. Already you now must PAY to get your extra solar power on the grid as nobody wants it. Sounds good? No because solar now pretty much has an infinite payback time. The baseload however has never seen a negative price. Which is where storage comes in, which is absolutely tumbling in price In addition, you cant run a country on purely renewables without storage, you need a reliable baseload, you know, the whole duck curve problem. For most of Europe storage is impossible. When looking at total system costs for a reliable system nuclear power needs to come down 85 in cost to be competitive with renewables. Cost and system effects of nuclear power in carbonneutral energy systems The study finds that investments in flexibility in the electricity supply are needed in both systems due to the constant production pattern of nuclear and the variability of renewable energy sources. However, the scenario with high nuclear implementation is 1.2 billion EUR more expensive annually compared to a scenario only based on renewables, with all systems completely balancing supply and demand across all energy sectors in every hour. For nuclear power to be cost competitive with renewables an investment cost of 1.55 MEURMW must be achieved, which is substantially below any cost projection for nuclear power. This is excluding battery storage, which already delivers nuclear scale energy day in and day out in California Edit some more numbers for you, on 14 oktober, not even in the summer. The solar production went from 13 GW to 2 GW in 1 hour. The total Dutch consumption at that time was about 17 GW. Take a look at the Californian grid? They built half the storage in the last year. Its not a decade long project. Batteries goes from charging at 5 GW to supplying at 6 8 GW during the evening and then entirely replaces all fossil peak production during the evening. Your arguments are stuck in 2018 land, I would suggest you grounding yourself in 2024 and then extrapolate a few years forward to see the where we are headed. Some more numbers for you on 20 september, the solar production had to shut down over 40 of its capacity due to oversupply. The Dutch Power companies need to PAY the large solar fields operators to shut down and PAY Germany to please take some of our power to keep the grid from exploding. All thid whilst needing to pay for basically 2 complete structures with both fossil and renewable So you had enough oversupply to shut down 40 of solar, where are you going to fit nuclear power in that picture? Shut down the entire nuclear fleet from sunup to sundown? Youre sooo close to understanding, but youve decided that nuclear power is the only solution. This quote from the scientific article above might help you understand The study finds that investments in flexibility in the electricity supply are needed in both systems due to the constant production pattern of nuclear and the variability of renewable energy sources. Both nuclear power and renewables need flexibility because running a peaking nuclear power plant, which is what you are suggesting, is utmost insanity.",Negative,-2,0.8249588906764984,Reply

Today we mostly build solar PV and onshore wind so EUR2050MWh. Meaning total costs for the ratepayers in 2024 are EUR4580MWh. What does Hinkley Point C cost in 2024 euros? EUR170MWh for 35 years after being completed. Lets go with the horrible, horrible Hinckley point, 50 bln for 26Twh of production per years over its expected 60 year lifetime, which can easily be extended. Even this horrible project comes in at 32 per Mwh. Considerably cheaper than your Australian example.S So now youre just making up your own broken napkin math rather than relying on the EUR170MWh CFD in 2024 euros Hinkley Point C has with the government, which they are likely looking to make a loss on. Reality keeps on calling as you pull the blinders ever more tightly. You truly cant comprehend anything which is contrary to your logically broken positions.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"Nah man youre just making up stuff now Your solution is heat pumps, really? Heat pumps are a thing here however again due to the cold most houses cant actually install them, only a relatively small percentage. Your solution is to spend 1520k on isolation, 5k on a heatpump and 200 per year on servicing of set heatpump? You also apparently dont know how the Hinkley energy stuctue works, its a contract, has nothing to do with cost. France has pulled a fast one on the British which is actuality extremely funny. They will receive over 170 billion in revenue in 35 years if the contract stays the same. Might wanna take a look at the example in Finland buddy?

Reddit,2024-10-19,Which is why heat pumps of course doesnt work in Scandinavia. Lol. It has nothing to do with cost while then likely looking to make a loss on it. The insanity just keeps on flowing. You dont seem to have heard about interest paid on the loan? Are you that financially illiterate? Finland example Your napkin math based on the latest figure released for what the project had already spent in 2018 while the project took another 5 years to finish. It of course did not accumulate any further costs during those three years encountering numerous new delays !!!! You do know that there are no public figures for what OL3 cost to build by the end? The consensus is that new built nuclear power costs EUR140240MWh 1 2 3 4 5 Then profit needs to be made.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"They all keep quoting the 2018 settlement. Thank you for not going to the primary source but rather finding anything to confirm your bias. With the confirmation of the settlement and TVO disclosing its total investment, it is possible to indicate the cost of the Finnish EPR. TVOs current capital expenditure assumptions and the effect of the settlement agreement estimates its total investment to be around EUR5.5 billion US6.42 billion on top of this AREVA had losses of EUR5.5 billion, for a total of EUR11 billion US12.4 billion compared with the initial estimate cost in 2003 of around EUR3 billion. That is the source. Do you see how it is an instantaneous picture based on the current sate of affairs in 2018 while costs continued to accumulate for 5 more years, all while it does not count any profit for the reactor builder. But given your napkin math you dont have any understanding of fixed costs, operation costs, fuel costs, financial costs and so on. You simply keep making stuff up hoping no one calls you out, and when you get called out the goalposts start to shift.",Neutral,0,0.9997863173484802,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Yeah, definitely not a bad call out, but I think as it is with most value plays, you have to look at things that arent going to be in earnings reports or at least account for the lag time. Theyve been cutting costs, sold their HQ for 50m which hasnt shown on a Quarterly report yet. That will also reduce spend in the future. This will also be the first quarter in which the added revenue from the Overstock dot com relaunch will be included. Youre right, they definitely arent out of the woods yet. A lot of work to do. But from how it looks to me, not even the potential for a turnaround is priced in as of now. Their EPS is negative so PE is null, but the price to sales ratio is like 0.3 now.

If youre really interested in the companyplay it wouldnt be a bad idea to listen throughwatch the investor conference they had along with this earnings. Im tentatively bullish on the company still. I think Lemonis has a lot of good ideas and has reformed after giving too many overly optimistic projections. He seems to be making much more conservative promises. I think having physical towel stores again is going to be a great thing for the company, letting people out in the world know that the brand still exists. Lemonis bought 1.5m in shares after the earnings reportthe stock tanking, which was by far his largest buyin to date. That unfortunately for me did absolutely nothing to move the stock up. I think the market is waiting for tangible results before theyre going to reprice. Shorts are probably still hoping for the bankruptcy. There was a lot of other bullish news before and after earnings, and again, none of that did anything to positively impact the price of the stock. That said, I think the stock is still highly undervalued even for the current situation. The company has a good balance sheet and other valuable assets. If you take the market cap and subtract their assets then the market is essentially valuing the company at 0. Lmk if you have any other questions though. Happy to chat despite the pain this has caused me. Edit I do also still have a very small position on. Calls for next June and Jan 2026.

Reddit,2024-08-13,"Car makers currently struggle with many things. While the conservative sales are mostly attributed to buyers being under financial pressure, personally I believe, a far more relevant reason is, that car buyers make competent decisions. Those, who are hell bent on fossile fuel cars will delay their next car buy as much as possible. Why? Because they know, those cars will disappear and they intend to drive their last one as long as possible. EV buyers on the other hand wait out their buy, because the technology is making massive strives and buying two years from now means, you will get a much more sophisticated product at a time, when significantly better infrastructure has been built. Overall this will blunt the market for cars in the west for the next 5 years Assuming, there will be no possible measures by goverments to greatly incentivise buying EVs now. That would change things. There should be a massive run however at the end of that phase. Tesla adds a whole new problem to that general issue of car builders though. Elon Musk is massively and publicly and aggressively at odds with the views of his most important customer base. There may only be one company that has publicly declared to buy no more Tesla, but others will silently decide that turning up with Teslas at their customers will send the wrong signal. This means, buyers for car fleets which bought Tesla to project a liberal, open, visionary mindset will stop buying. And these people are a pretty big market. And its a market, that will not wait out the next halfdecade. As for the other things Yes, Tesla is doing a lot of stuff. And some of that stuff basically finances the Elondepression in car sales. But there is a problem. And its Elon. Because a lot of his projects look like a deeply homonal teenager with no impulse control is just trying to fulfill all of his dreams. And thats fine for a billionaire to do. Some of what he does will massively improve the future and you need to be a little crazy to do that. But if you run those dreams as a business, its a red flag. And a CEO, who increasingly seems to regress into a teenagers level of self control is a massive liability.",Negative,-1,0.9511702060699463,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-13,"5x would be 400. Relative valuations dont make sense for a company involved in as many disruptive technologies as Tesla. I do agree that Optimus and similar AGI bots are likely still a long way out, especially when considering the regulatory hurdles a humanlike AGI on 2 legs would bring with it. Tgis is why I dont consider Optimus for my investment thesis. Waymo robotaxi operates in restricted areas of urban centers to ensure max reliability in execution. Tesla FSD wont be limited in such a way, since their cars are cheap enough in production to be retailgrade. If youve watched any of the recent FSD versions perform on US streets, you know that full fledged, visiononly FSD at this point is only a matter of time, after which Waymo and other Robotaxi businesses will not be competitive anymore because of the exorbitant manufacturing cost of their vehicles. At last theres their venture into the energy storage business, which is going to see rapid growth acceleration in the near future due to the increased demand for energy availability in computation and storage in renewables. Yes, I do believe that Tesla will be one of the biggest companies on Earth, because theyre positioned in multiple high growth sectors and theyve proven in the past to have vision as well as the competence to implement it.",Neutral,0,0.9676514267921448,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-13,"I dont. I literally talked about a company that has robots working right now in warehouses and the frontlines of a war. Its Teslas Optimus thats miles behind Robots have existed for centuries. Robots, that can learn to do any thing a human can do, have not. I havent denied that there are robots being produced today that can do a certain specific thing very well, but thats not the value proposition of Optimus. Waymo uses sensor fusion of vision, radar and lidar mapped streets so that the autopilot system knows 100 what its seeing. like I said, Tesla refused to adopt Lidar for this reason and then scrapped radar as well. This has already caused deaths Im not sure what youre arguing against here. I think Elons argument about humans also only possessing visual sensors to interpret road signage and events is quite convincing. Why would an AI not be able to perform similarly well or even better when supplied with the same data? No, because the internal emails of Tesla in 2016 that were revealed in the recent court case showed that demos have been staged and faked at the behest of Elon before. Its not a conspiracy theory Elon and Tesla just has no credibility in this regard. If youre living in 2016, your sentiment towards FSD is not a surprise. Tesla has only recently scrapped most of their initial approach to FSD in favour of an endtoend neural network solution, which is already orders of magnitude more performant than the prior statically programmatic approach both with regards to decision making and driving comfort. I highly encourage you to watch some of the latest videos of FSD 12.5.x in action and form your own opinion. I know people who use FSD privately this is not staged. Some of the car companies I mentioned prior also manufacture batteries. Tesla batteries merely change the packaging not improve the technology. Thats of no concern in my opinion. Tesla is renowned for their manufacturing prowess. Besides, they will likely outcompete other producers when it comes to infrastructure contracting simply because theyre an American company. The demand will far outmatch the currently available supply, so theres a piece of the pie available for everyone anyways. Also, the idea of LIION buffer storage for renewables is really showcasing you lack a sense of scale of this technology. Theres a reason why other companies have avoided this. I do not know what youre referring to here as I lack the necessary technical understanding however, Id expect a company which has successfully driven innovation in the past to not make mistakes a random dude on reddit would be able to lecture me about. Im sure there are valid reasons for their choice of storage technology. However, a pe of 50 means even if all the tech came to fruition the current price is overpriced. If the technology doesnt pan out or a competitor gets there first which I have argued is the case then its worth considerably less than it is now. I havent looked into the exact valuation fundamentals. However, Im not seeing any other company make FSDcapable retail grade cars a product which will be highly sought after en masse, which leads me to believe that any valuation really is justified at this point, since theyre effectively going to have a monopoly. FSDcapable vehicles are the first mass produced, consumer oriented AIrobotics merger product and they will capture the global market by storm.",Positive,1,0.9968835413455963,Reply

Yahoo,2024-08-07,"Q.2 2024 earnings were OK by UIS standards:They seem to doing OK on the margin side. Their &#34;New Logo&#34; business is increasing. On the downside, revenue is flat and free cash flow was down, though I suspect that may relate to defeasance of debt/pensions. There&#39;s liquidity of over $300 million on hand.As I&#39;ve commented before, overall revenue has been flat for the last five years. You&#39;d like to see it grow, even marginally, in a decent economy. They have big-time debt to pay or restructure in two years+. I&#39;d like to see revenue grow as that approaches.On a day when the market is up over 300 points. UIS stock has fallen below $4.00. This is the second quarter in a row that earnings have garnered a negative reaction on share price. I will parse the earnings conference call after it&#39;s posted. Meanwhile, this reaction says people aren&#39;t impressed. Flat revenue against a higher-inflation backdrop doesn&#39;t instill confidence.",Positive,1,0.9999799728393555,Main
