Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base. This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that dont exist.

By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it.

Reddit,2024-09-10,"Well good luck to both of us. Stock is heavily levered w no full year guidance so theres good chance the stock moves a lot post earnings call up or down.

Unfortunately I have not sat outside a Petco counting shopping bags like that Bath Bodyworks WSB diligence so its anybodys guess whether theyre able to hit those numbers. With respect to the new CEO, I think itll be really disappointing if the new CEO Joel talks about the business the same way the last CEO Ron talked about the business e.g., growing revenue expanding gross margins, as I dont think those are credible growth avenues see my DD on Petco.

At the same time, they said the businessabsent a rebound in discretionary product saleswill not get back to 42 gross margin. Sounds like theres only room for 1 or 2 points of margin improvement.

Reddit,2024-08-09,"While I am actually on your alls viewsidewhatdafukeva you cant deny the overwhelming opinion that this is a loss of opportunity while you wait. The biggest argument is a high yield savings account HYSA will out pace it in a year. I think thats a bit short sighted because their acting like interest rates will never move lower, but their point still stands, currently you would be better off letting it sit and accumulate interest than bag holding. We dont even have to guess at a timeframe or anything. Just take what you would put in intel and calculate your balance in a high yield savings account over the next 2 years by month. That is literally what you are aiming to beat minimum, otherwise its actually a loss for your risk and effort. If in the next 30 days you sell for a 10 pop, great, but the company literally told everyone expect nothing for a year, and even after that, who boy, just know we are working hard and will update then. The longer you hold, the higher that needs to be just to beat the HYSA. Back to the short sightedness of the HYSA . 1 they probably are not doing that, its just a floor they are using to compare what they are doing with their money ex not giving two craps about a 1 dividend and trying to beat it. Their being smart and not marrying the play, stock or HYSA, and we all should be doing that. If the HYSA is no good, dump it and move to the next channel thats best at that time. The difference between intel and HYSA is you can get out of the HYSA at anytime with 0 loss and invest elsewhere, while Intel may have lost value. They 100 dont make perfect plays, but its hard for them to watch others make dumb plays that cant even track interest rates without saying anything. Bottom line, if you plan to be 100 passive, your picks are probably not best, especially if you refuse to pivot when terrible news shows up at the front page of every search engine. Thats why they keep screaming toss it in a fund to people who are doing this.",Neutral,0,0.9789693355560303,Reply

Its down to the price its at because its a shit company compared to what it was. It has an 87b market cap compared to Nvidias 2.6 TRILLION. They are in the same sector, yet Intel is worth 30x less even though they were founded 2 decades earlier. The really hilariously sad part is that you people are only touching the stock out of the fallacious human reasoning of surely it must go back up. If they beat earnings and pumped 25 that day instead of declined, none of you people would be touching it. Missed the boat, its overvalued but because it went down, your primal ape brain is telling you the only logical place for it to go now is back up.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"I cut the cable in 2008 when my cablesatellite bill was above 300month not to mention the cost of the receivers. I couldnt justify 300mo for the volume and percentage of commercials I was forced to watch on live TV. My first streaming device was my Wii console and ultimately moved to Roku. Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to.

Traders want to take advantage of the latest job numbers to make profitable their bond trades, and they will quickly dump back into stocks once they get the excess liquidity they want. Asset prices are still elevated so introducing excess liquidity would be problematic for combating inflation. QE caused wild asset inflation and that changes the dynamic.

EDV is another 30 year with even more rate sensitivity because they are zero coupon notes but I dont really understand why that is. Then you have TMF, a 3x leveraged longterm treasury bond fund.

Reddit,2024-08-03,"There are around 38 million people in poverty in the US and around 23 million millionaires. However did you realize that the majority of millionaires in the US are over the age of 50. So the easiest way to pick out someone who isnt a millionaire is to find someone young and working a 95 job. It is surprisingly easy to sort Americans by income and picking a random one that fits either category is also relatively simple. And no, Im not talking about people who dress fashionably or drive a Cybertruck as their daily driver. I mean that old couple that bought their house in the 60s and 70s and have been retried since the 90s. That doesnt change the fact that bottom wages dont keep up with inflation. Middle and high wages do, but bottom wages only change when the minimum wage is adjusted. Of course there are some jobs that are exceptions. Costco workers get inflation based adjustments as do Starbucks employees, but your average Dollar General, Wendys or Walmart employee is not getting inflation adjusted increases.

I mentioned that minimum wage going up is the main way that people in the lowest tier get raises, but that doesnt keep up with inflation.

You then responded that America has a lot of millionaires to which I stated America has more people in poverty thank millionaires. You stated that 1.6 of people make minimum wage which is a completely inane and stupid metric to go by especially realizing that if you make 14.75 and minimum wage is 14 then you are making over minimum wages and said you gave references that you NEVER provided, so I instead gave a reference on American poverty directly from the American census which supports the statements I have made. So when did this swap from a conversation about the poorest in the US not getting wage increases that keep up with inflation to only people making minimum wage are poor?

Yahoo,2024-10-29,"There are many issues in this election, but one central issue hasalways been what most significantly divides the Republicans fromthe Democrats. Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies that growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear.",Neutral,0,0.9394843578338623,Main

partnerships with Microsoft,  Google, Palantir  now AWS says a lot.. the more partnerships the more sticky Orcl gets and believe me it&#39;s not a piece of cake to change multimillion dollar technology investments..

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like ORCL to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax ORCL would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of ORCL stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on ORCL stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on ORCL stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.
