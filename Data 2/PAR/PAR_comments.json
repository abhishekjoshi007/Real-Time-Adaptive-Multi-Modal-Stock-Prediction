We have seen instances of companies reporting good quarterly results, but the stock falling nevertheless, because people thought the results would be even better. High expectations cause high dissapointment when not met. On the other side, we have also seen bad quarterly results with the stock jumping, because 1. People found it was a good time to buy in big, raising demand, raising stock value. 2. The bad results were not as bad as people thought it would be. Low expectations cause low dissapointment when not met. Now for Intel, I personally think that a lot of damage to the stock value is already priced in. Since march 2024 the stock lost more than 50 on its value on basically the same news over and over. Bad results, layoffs, no competetive products yet. Right now people ARE expecting bad results. And if Intel can show they are not that bad, for example for cashflow, assets to sell and others, I think the stock can rise. Disclaimer I am invested into Intel so my opinion is biased."

Theres sometimes a timing difference between the last 409a and the last capital raise or market check on share price depending on how small the company is. Smaller growth companys 409a analysis is more about the financial projections of the company since the last capital raise rather than the current perceived value of it. Its possible that the share price you see to calculate the value of your grant was done on the 409a but the actual value of the shares is higher.

If youre getting options, you are not actually being paid in shares but the option to buy an amount of shares at an agreed price at a point in time in the future.

In Arizona, we will comply with local regulations and pursue similar industry design standards for water management. Two important aspects of our approach are water recycling and water reclamation At startup, approximately 65 of the water used in the Arizona operation will come from TSMCs inhouse water recycling systems. The recycled water will be used in systems such as our air scrubbers and cooling tower systems. To achieve our goal of 90 water reclamation, We will build an advanced water treatment facility Industrial Water Reclamation Plant at our Phoenix operation with a design goal of achieving Near Zero Liquid Discharge. This means the fabs will be capable of using nearly every drop of water back into the facility. This is a process of converting industrial wastewater into water that can be reused for a variety of purposes."

Its not as simple as creating an ez software layer when Sagemaker and Vertex AI have been around for quite some time now. Besides, CUDA and cuDNN is not even in the software layer. First, they have to be able to create an incredibly efficient chip for both training and inference, second a CUDAequivalent, third to steer ML frameworks to force it to adopt a new nonCUDA architecture, fourth is to force researchers and developers to develop new models catered to the new hardwares alongside all dependencies, etc. People who hasnt trained complex models or created them or deployed them are so uninformed about how tightly integrated NVIDIA is to everything. Tech moats are a different kind of moat. Integrations are one strong thing in tech. And NVIDIAs moat is just incredibly complex. Companies that serve AI products will have to redesign their huge pipeline, redo bunch of their codes, retrain some models, etc. when a new nonCUDA thing and nonNVIDIA hardware happens.

My personal thinking is that Google is gonna bottleneck itself with their own TPU hardware sooner or later as they are either gonna fully commit to it or just suddenly pivot using NVIDIA again similar to their switch from Qualcomm to Tensor G1G4 with Samsung fabs to TSMC moving foward. They will, however, be perpetually contending within the leaderboards for LLM although my personal favorites leading these would still be META and OpenAI for different reasons. GOOG has a personal motivation to do it tho since they have the Google Assistant thing which is probably their biggest usage of this in addition to GSuite additions.

I dont hold any of AMD and Google just because I am still incredibly confused as to what their goals are. Personally I dont think Google will outpace NVIDIA and they are two different companies. Google is software and Nvidia is hardware CUDA which isnt really a replicable software. Googles direct competitor is Microsoft and somehow META. I just think that Googles software side is incredibly replicable and that the shift from perspectives that their sales are gonna go from ads to AI will have a tough time. On the software end, I got Microsoft or even META. META just because Gen AI tools is going to be extremely connected to their biggest shtick which is content creator platforms, and the fact that META, IMHO, has the best AI research team. FAIR has been producing the best AI papers for the past years most esp in computer vision. People dont know that things such as Magic Eraser, Magic Lasso Tool root itself from METAs Segment Anything which is the most ground breaking thing in Computer Vision alongside Diffusion Models. Microsoft too have strong integrations with software from Teams to MS Office suite and Windows. Most underrated is Github and Github Copilot. They literally own a shit ton of free code to train LLM models. For AMD, I am not so well versed on their products. They wont be able to compete with NVIDIA some time in the future. Honestly, if I were them, I would just try to completely dunk on the sinking ship that is Intel and fabricate CPUs that tightly integrate with NVIDIA GPUs on cloud clusters i do have a local AMD Ryzen laptop with RTX i use for local small training of models. Current virtual machines right now still have Intel NVIDIA GPUs e.g. V100, A10G. If AMD will just focus on beating Intel instead of NVDA, they could just win the AI race alongside them. If NVIDIA gets tired of Intels bullshit, I can see them fabricating their own CPUs. NVIDIA will still be the strongest contender by a mile for atleast 57 years. I cant see anyone coming closely to rivaling their moat until then. Even if a war breaks out in Taiwan and new chips halt in production for some time, the remaining functioning data centers can still function IMO. One company that I suggest worth looking at is definitely Qualcomm. They are trying to enter the desktop space and making the edge device phones, etc. much beefier to have its own Neural Processing Unit that are capable to run multimodal models. As phones get better in that, they have less need to access cloud servers which in turn means less need for GPU servers NVIDIA. Although Qualcomms direct competitor at that space is Apple which is gonna do the same. I am not an FI, but as an AI engineer, I am bullish on NVIDIA. I would definitely think that it is quite overhyped by people right now because it has been an AI arms race and every one is trying to race which AI product will be the first to profit. The purchasing will slow down. However, believe it or not, we are just scratching the surface for what AI can do. Diffusion models are just only around for about 3 years, LLMs for 2.5 years, and we havent reached those breakthroughs to the traditional AI real money makers yet such as detection and reinforcement learning but I have a feeling that it will come out sooner. But the thing is that comparing it to crypto is crazy because AI has business use cases and profitable as long as it has the proper market. NVIDIA is just creating more data centers to keep up with the cloud service demands from AWS, Azure, etc. but even if the demand gets low, they can always sell the access to services for cheap and still get money from it. But who knows, thats the free market for you."

JPMorgan analysts told clients after field work and discussions with management, they cut their estimate for VFs fiscal 2025 earnings per share. The analysts pointed to wholesale challenges with The North Face, and ongoing traffic headwinds across brands. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients that after recent fieldwork and management access, they cut their fiscal 2025 earnings per share EPS estimate to 65 cents, which they noted was 35 below the Wall Street consensus. The analysts based that on an 8 yearoveryear decline in revenue, also worse than consensus forecasts. Ill add that Im not saying just because JPM says its bad, its bad. But wanted to get your take on why its not bad. Why not just wait till after Q2 print to buy to see where things shake out. How did you get comfortable. Ive also been watching this same stock for a year now."

Corp has experienced fluctuations in its financial performance over the past four fiscal years, showing growth in revenue but facing challenges with declining net income. The companys EBITDA and operating income have varied significantly, while balance sheet metrics have seen declines. Margins and ratios have been mixed, with a notable drop in net profit margin. VFC has faced both positive and negative news in the market and is exposed to diverse risks across operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG factors. Key Financial Insights Revenue increased from 9.24 billion in 2020 to 11.61 billion in 2023 but declined to 10.45 billion in 2024. Net income dropped significantly from positive figures to a loss of 968.88 million in 2024. Gross profit margins remained stable, ranging from 41 to 52. Positive free cash flow in most years, except for 2023. Historical volatility of 58 indicates moderate stock price volatility compared to the market. Risk Factors Operational risks from supply chain disruptions and quality control issues. Regulatory risks related to trade policies, labor regulations, and environmental standards. Macroeconomic risks including economic downturns, currency fluctuations, and inflation. Competitive risks due to industry competition and evolving consumer preferences. Technological risks from cybersecurity threats and the need for digital investments. ESG risks impacting brand reputation and consumer perception. Conclusion Given the mixed financial performance, market sentiments, and diverse risks facing V.F. Corp, it is recommended to hold the stock for now. Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports, risk management strategies, and industry trends before making any significant buying or selling decisions."

I agree that TNF is currently the revenue driver hence this delayed winter in the States could affect sales. But keep in mind 60 of the sales comes from Europe Asia. Only 40 of it comes from the US. One thing this analyst Matthew Boss didnt add in his thesis is the thriving backpacks business of TNF, this and international sales would likely offset the decline in the US. One more thing is that the CEO has already guided TNF revenue downwards for the coming quarter last earnings call. The stock also has retraced since this negative catalyst watch, so you could argue it is priced in. The problem with holding off the purchase because of this one negative catalyst is that when all the other brands show signs of turning Vans, Timbs, Dickies of which the latter two and he announces two more brand sales Jansport Kipling and completely brings us back to optimal capital structure, we would be off to the races, being potentially valued at 1x PS which would be 10B in market cap."

Its usually very boring mostly sideways dividend, you need to wait for significant dips decreases in demand due to a downturn or some disaster in order to be worth the investment compared to other sectors. Buying a top before a crash can therefore range from painful to catastrophic takes long to get back up. Ive never seen such a steep rise in the market prices of utilities. I still cant believe what Im seeing right now. Ive received CEG for free from my EXC position some years ago. It has now a way higher market cap than EXC itself used to be smaller when it split off. Ive unfortunately sold CEG in Q1, because it seemed like there was little steam left in the PE. I was wrong, because there was apparently still some AI momentum driving it up. Ive bought into VST during the Julys dip, because I wanted to try a momentum trade being more of a Buffetstyle investor historically. The gain has been sick so far for a utility. Im also in NRG since 2023 up 140 from a year ago, 200 on my cost basis. However, now Im just waiting for a signal to take profits and get out. Holding for a dividend which is what I typically use utilities for seems very inefficient at the current valuations better alternatives may exist. Except now I dont know, what signal Im looking for if I used PE alone, I would have sold already. !imgemotet5_2th524271 TLDR My gut feeling is that it is not a particularly good time to buy utilities bagholding is painful with those. US has a lot of natural gas and a NG powerplant takes about a year to build. So I see some dramatic rise in electricity costs unlikely only in short term."

TLN with AWSAMZN for a buildout of up to 960MW data campus with 120MW already built out 2. CEG and MSFT have announced a partnership that is contingent on CEG starting up a unit at three mile island and alot of other contingencies, which if all come together would start earning CEG money in 202829 This leaves me to believe 1. Dualreactors are key to any colocation deal for now , because in single reactor plants most of VST nukes the power is shut off for planned maintenance outages, which makes the colocated data center immediately a taker of the utilities power supply aka the grid and that strips away most of the benefit to a behind the meter deal between the plant operator and data center tenant 2. States matter Tln was able to do the AMZN deal because their asset located in PA Susquehanna plant is a dual reactor which never received any state level subsidies to keep the plant open, compare that to states like IL,OH,NY,NJ, and a few more where good amount of CEG dual reactors are located, as well as VST single reactors who were compensated in the form of hourly credits per MWH to make sure the plants didnt shut down, these state programs require the plant operator to offer a larger amount of output to the state for years, in that period of time the state would have to grant signoff on any deal , and lastly the state would need to be incentivized to give up the baseload power they currently have locked in under these subsidy programs Lastly , I am not sure why NRG gets mentioned in this Nuke colocation theme, it is my understanding that NRG sold its last nuclear plant to CEG under pressure from Elliot management and proceeded to take the money and buyback shares , they are clearly riding the wave, long term NRGs model of owning less generation assets while growing the overall amount of power sold to customers seems it can run into problems if power pricing continues in its trajectory. Merely my two cents and definitely not investment advice"

Its worth noting the other TX datacenter discussed in here is the Southern Project partially owned by CEG this was 44 bought from NRG in 112023, after this transaction NRG no longer owns any nuclear Gen , for 1.75 Billion dollars of proceeds. Below BusinessInsider reported that Amazon AMZN evaluated multiple existing nuclear sites in December 2023 before signing an agreement with Talen Energys TLN Susquehanna asset. The nuclear plan was code named Piano Man and involved approval from Amazons CEO. Amazon evaluated four other nuclear projects including 880MW Maryland, 1,200MW Texas, 960MW Pennsylvania, and a separate 900MW also in Pennsylvania. The only nuclear plant in Maryland is Constellation Energys CEG Calvert Cliffs. Texas has two dual unit plants Comanche Peak owned by Vistra Energy VST and South Texas Project partially owned by CEG. Pennsylvania has three dual unit nuclear plants aside from Susquehanna Beaver Valley VST, Limerick CEG, and Peach Bottom CEG and PSEG PEG joint venture. Per the Amazon document at the time there are limited pipeline opportunities after these projects, but we will continue to develop all feasible options. In addition to large nuclear and small modular reactors SMR, Amazon evaluated power agreements for natural gas and geothermal power. In a response to BusinessInsider, Amazon described the document as outdated"

AMD did not get worse while he was there or after he left, neither did TESLA, nor Apple all of which he spoke positively after leaving. He left Intel saying negative things, and we have all witnessed the subsequent ongoing failures at the company. Happy for us to be on opposite sides of a trade."

The problem is, it required keeping the same execs that ran GM into the ground to continue operations, this time on the tax payers dime. That was a huge risk that paid off for Obama. But Intel would have to be dealt with the same way because of how much they outsource.

TSMC couldnt just buy out an Intel plant and start making TSMC wafers the next morning they would have to overhaul the whole facility. For example, Intel just bought a bunch of HighNA machines from ASML, and TSMC doesnt use HighNA in their processes. That equipment would be worth nothing to them at auction. So Intel is marking down these machines on their books as say 200M a piece of PPE book value, but they and the other fab equipment are deeply illiquid, and Intel couldnt actually resell them for 200M. I would be surprised if they could auction off their plants for a quarter of their book value. As far as Intels node 2nm is a marketing term, so take that with a grain of salt, and the big thing is that its yield and performance arent yet known. For comparison, Samsung claims to currently have a leadingedge 2nm process, but yields are reportedly 10. If they fab 10 chips on a wafer, they have to throw 9 away, so they cant get any orders and are bleeding money. And 18As performance isnt publicly known either. TSMCs CEO claims its on par with lastgen TSMC, but of course, he has every reason to slant things. Intel has released a design kit to customers in the last six months, and have got very few design wins outside of some defense stuff the US govt basically bullied firms into ordering, so I am not optimistic about 18A working out. But 18A is really where Intels future lies at.... all its eggs are in that basket. 18A has to work well, and has to fill a plant with orders running 247 at high yield in order for Intel to turn around. Anything short of that is looking like curtains."

For this reason, Obama wisely although risky allowed GM to operate its own self without federal government oversight. The very same people that ran the company into the ground to begin with.

None of which was released until even now they just say they will give intel the money by end of this year. The money that supposed to pay for the new factory that the governemnt pushes intel to build, so US will not rely on oversea mfg like samsung, and TSMC. But i wasted enough knowledge on a pig.

Instead of trying to prove how smart you are, after showing you dont even know the basics about Intels main competitor, maybe use this time to reevaluate your investment. Youve still got time to sell now that your thesis just imploded though lets be real, its not yours. You read a DD on Intel months ago before the TSMC news, which is why you didnt know, and are relying on very out dated DD to justify your bags Spend less time outsmarting me and more saving whatever remains in your mostly blown up Intel position."

Not worth mentioning due to the fact that it is only a small portion of their manufacture.

And fyi TSMC is also struggling to with american labor market due to vast difference in work culture. Likely to face plenty of lawsuits.

Said only Intel will be used by the US because they dont want over seas stuff despite them letting the largest semi company on the planet and a state owned one open a factory in the US you didnt even know about. Try to pretend you were actually talking about global supply needs while still only talking about the US government which isnt even the full global market compared to actual companies like Apple. Explained that Intel has state of the art stuff when TSMC is miles beyond them and even Intel admits it, right down to saying their goal in their own Investor meeting was to be number 2 because they cant touch TSMC though you didnt know that because youre not educated on the sector beyond a 5 second google search and the actual info you learned here today. Oh and explained how bailouts actually preserve shareholders when they almost never do. So you failed in understanding the auto sector, understanding the semi sector Intel is in, understanding how bailouts work, and understanding share class. So basically you dont know the markets you trade in or the company you own. And despite all this you wont even delete the clear lack of knowledge. All so you can win on Reddit. despite consistently showing you have 0 idea what youre talking about. You dont even get how just the argument Intel would 100 get bailed out and preserve shareholder value shows you dont get markets at all. Thats how beyond you all this is. Its gone past funny, its sad. Borderline depressing because I know youre going to blow your port to 0 if this is your market knowledge. Do yourself a favor, just sell everything, buy SPY and let people smarter than you manage this. Oh and since you dont know, SPY is a collection of the top 500 companies, it is rebalanced so it is managed by smart people who know things like TSMC exists. Its also up 33 on the year, so youll start making money now. You can see this by clicking SPY and the 1 year button on Robinhood. Ive helped you enough though. I dont think youre a troll. I think you just dont understand stocks, youre down big on Intel and youre in the cope phase of lashing out at people, calling them dumb and hoping some magic will happen to fix your mistake. I can even hear you. If Intel just goes back to 30 I can break even and be done with this stupid company. Ive seen kids like you come and go here. Im constantly educating you all on the discord, but if youre going to start being successful youll have to accept you made a mistake and reevaluate your play. And that requires self reflection and an open mind. Or stay angry, tell me how wrong I am, and keep screaming at your monitor how this stupid market doesnt understand man. Why is it going down!!!!! every morning."

Commodities Likely to Benefit Steel and Copper The reconstruction efforts would increase demand for steel and copper, benefiting companies involved in mining and production of these metals.

However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions.

So the initial within next 1 3 years AIrelated layoffs will be accommodated by the economy. The situation becomes tricky in mid to long term as AIs take over a large number of whitecollar jobs in creative fields from medical diagnosis to new products design and research. As required human participation in the economy declines, an obvious question of what those humans would do for a living in such economic structure comes forward. Market economy cannot work unless there is a large pool of people who are able to sell their labor, and a more or less matching pool of businesses that are in need of it. You mess with one side of this balance and you get either inflation or worse deflation, when nobody can afford the goods the business makes even at break even point. Without a serious economic restructuring, that is where our economy will end up with AI help. The issue is, if left to own devices of current economic system, the restructuring will result in an economic crisis not seen from the time of the Great Depression. And, our heart bleeding conservatives do not want the government to move a finger short of changing one number. Because of the ideological reasons, because of the perverted misunderstanding of what the free market is. So let it burn! Be forewarned."

It sounds like you are more on the ai producing mega tech company end rather than the big business consuming the ai product to increase productivity end. I am aware it does not cut down on a lot for you aside from speeding up some redundant basic coding etc, maybe summarizing some emails or writing some email first drafts if you dont feel like it that day. You likely already know this, but other business are finding ways to use ai to increase efficiency productivity. That is why the sector is growing. That is why there is demand for the product. Its early on for sure, but I dont think saying there is a 15 boost to productivity for office staff on the consumer side of ai is unreasonable or unrealistic. Even if its a bit shy of that currently, its only going to get better. If ai truly will not increase productivity or efficiency at all, then what good is it? It can harvest more data from consumers I suppose windows 11 comes to mind, but that wont be enough to justify the massive cost of building out these ai data centers and keeping them operational going forward. And if its all just a big failed experiment, wont that also lead to a bunch of layoffs in your sector? Sooo either way, layoffs?"

Supermicro as a company has serious issues, but liquid cooling at rack and data center level is a legitimate solution for a relatively recent problem.

This does not translate into a long term outperformance for a volatile index. Start with a price of 100. If the underlier goes down 5 percent, the fund goes down 10 to 90. Then if the underlier goes up 5, the fund goes up 10 which gets it to 99 only. Repeat over a long time and you will find a definite downward bias. The key here is that SSO doubles the daily price change so therefore the path daily up and down movements on how SPY gets to its current value matters. If it is a generally upwards trend over many days? SSO will outperform 2x SPY gains over that manyday period. If it is a slowgrind upwards or if there are large down days, then SSO will have less than 2x SPY gains. If the market is stagnant and SPY, then SSO will grind lower."

No, it is targeting the D2C market, which Starlink and TMobile only began targeting AFTER they realized AST was indeed going to succeed in launching their test satellite. The timing and nature of the announcement were telling. So rather, Starlink is attempting to compete with AST. In the future, it is possible AST eats at Starlinks core market and viceversa, but thats down the road. So how many satellites does ASTS have in space? ZERO, with plans to launch their first sometime in the month of September. They have BW3. Which is a test satellite, I admit. But it did earn revenue from a gov contract. It is also the sane size as the current production satellites, but with 10x less processing bandwidth. It will assist in providing commercial services, though. But to say they have no satelllites is misleading because it implies we dont even know if their current model will work. It will. Starlinkl has over 5,000 satellites already in space that are fully operational and being used by consumers. Yes, for stationary wifi. Not cellular service. If youre thesis were true, Comcast wouldve bankrupted Verizon and ATT. But we all know that wasnt what happened. Even if you account for the D2C Starlink V2 minis, there are only around 100 with maybe 20 beams each? AST sats have 5600 each. They may only be launching 5 sats, but sat count ignores sat capabilities. ASTS will have a dilution fairly soon to raise further capital and will leave retail investors holding heavy bags. The stock skyrocketed specifically because they stated no more dilution in 2024 and probably none in 2025 as they target prepayments and ExIm financing. Currently it costs about 20m per sat, launch included. Prepayments from Voda, Verizon, and Att now average 4m, 20m, and 5m per sat respectively give or take conditional on successful launch, operation, and FCC approval, all of which are imminent. And that is only 3 of about 40 MNO partners contributing. Currently, if they did 5050 debtprepayment, each MNO would only have to prepay 400k per sat if they take 2 years to build with Opex at 120m per year. And why would MNO want to pay for the sats? Because thats a small price to pay for global coverage, no dead zones, reduced tower costs, improved service, emergency service for disasters, especially when you get half the ARPU. The list goes on. Sorry, but your estimation is ignorant of the reality of the situation. The price will vary a lot over the next two years, but at the end of the day, they now have a service that works, a product to launch, and 40 of the largest telecoms on Earth who want them to succeed, nevermind the US military. Edit just a note on my math 85 sats20msat120m opex32.060B40 mno85 sats2300ksat. I forgot how my napkin math earlier worked out to 400k, I had a reason, but didnt write it down."

There are a lot of factors into AST becoming quite profitable. I personally can see the stock hitting 100, although I was originally thinking 2030 onwards. I may think differently if this 30 price holds for a while. TLDR. There are highly technical data analysis of the tech AST sats use and directly compares the tech from Starlink. Search it up.

ASTS has done it within the rules, FCC granted an Experimental License. And yes, you are betting on future income here with ASTS. When their satellites are up there, they have minimal costs for their WORLDWIDE service. Their profit margin is expected to be 90. They have MNOs with partners, that have 3 billion clients. So how much is it worth to have connection everywhere, on the sea, even in an airplane. Lets say only 200 million of the clients are willing to pay 5 usd a month, and ASTS gets 50, then thats 500 million revenue per month and with their profit margin lets say just 250 million profit PER MONTH. So lets say 3 billion profit a year and a PE Ratio of 20, thats 60 billion market cap or 250300 stock price. Ah, and we havent even talked aboud DoD contracts. ASTS already got a small DoD contract 900k, but its also just a test Satellite up there right now. Dilution wont be needed. If a MoU wants a commercial Agreement, they need to make prepayments like ATT did. Together with the revenue comming 2025 they have enough cash to get the next 2030 sattelites up there and then they will be cash flow positive."

That being said, this is very uninformed DD. Starlink is a competitor, but to say they have 5000 satellites, as if they are all capable of D2D, is misleading. They are in a stalemate and unless they convince the FCC to lax their permitted interference levels, they wont be launching their service anytime soon. This can go either way and we will have to see what the verdict is. ASTS will be worth 100share in 2 years, probably sooner. Assuming no disasters with launch and unfurling."

The whole point of ASTS is that it has a patented technology for the signal to reach mobile phones without any additional equipment other than your phone as a receiver. Starlink needs additional receiver that is klunky and ugly AF. Also, the business model of ASTS is smart, they will be offering their service through already established carriers, so they dont need to build up the distribution of their product. People will just have an additional option on their already existing mobile phone bill if they want to pay extra for global coverage and that will go to ASTS. Also, you cannot value a prerevenue company on a balance sheet data, are you dumb? That being said. Dilution is very likely if not certain. The durability of satelites is questionable, given just their sheer size largest sats ever put up to enable the transmission and especially signal receiving from earth, if there is any issue with space debree and one of the initial 5 is down, it could mean disaster. Global coverage is VERY VERY far away. And lastly are we sure EVERYONE is going to want to pay more for this fabled global coverage? Like, a grandma in maine is going to pay extra for this service? How many places are actually not covered by the existing 4g network already? Not that many actually. So ASTS is being priced as if the global adoption is a given, when in reality it could be that only adventurers and outdoors people will use the service. That is not a very huge market that would justify putting up 60 satelites in space to service their needs unless the subscription is priced hundreds of dollars per month which means even fewer people using it, meaning their revenues will likely be way lower than what we think today, and profitability might not ever be achieved. So yeah, id value this as a 1.21.6 billion market cap company atm. Definitely not 10b where its going currently."

That is a shit ton of income the US government will protect. ASTS works with carriers using this spectrum. Many also mentioned that telecom is a debt burdened business. But that is mostly because of these spectrum licenses and expenses infrastructure, ASTS wont have these costs. 2. There will be no dilution. There is additionally outstanding warrants that ASTS can redeem. 3. The market cap is only like 9billion. And ofc it doesnt make a lot of money its prerevenue. But it will start making some real money this year still. The margins on the sat revenue is 90. Just ask your daddy Elon about how Tesla did it for a decade."

I think the other thing to keep in mind is that a large chunk of their sat costs are supposedly launch costs. Looking at 1500 kgsat and about 3800kg for F9, you get about half of the cost being launch costs. WhenIf Starship comes that will cut margins almost in half. Which is nuts. Also, they do cost 20m per sat, but if only 10m to build, they can build a lot more with their current cash than everyone thinks. Im pretty sure they have 280x raised using ATM in July so maybe 30m?50m debt120m warrants480m. They COULD build 480m120m annual opex120m runway cushion10msat24 sats next year if they can get to 2mo cadence. Then they only need 15 more sats for continuous coverage in Norther ln hemisphere. Just building them gives leverage to partners for financing launch costs. Its much better to go to partnersdebt markets with hey we have 25 of these money printers on the ground, but they belong in space than hey we need halp to build them. Especially if BBB2 works as intendedproves market. And that brings me to the most important part. The MAIN issue this company had was executing production. Sure, they cost 115m for 5 sats, but it took two years, so thats 240m opex. It shouldve been 120m. They had issues with supply chain and also did a surprise rework of their antennae elements. That is how we wound up in the 2s. But thats likely, with a high degree of certainty, behind us. They still have more to prove with manufacturing, but their current targets are 17 for 2025. I think we will see 25 launched by 2026 end given current pacing. That sounds pessimistic, but it scales with their cadence record, AND having intermittent coverage 50 of the time whereas before you had it 0 is actually huge to the point a lot of customers may not notice that much, especially if the service keeps getting better over time."

People originally thought that they couldnt sell intermittent service so bearish throughout, but that turns out to have been a mistake because A They could never have launched 20 sats at once anyways, even if they had all the money on hand and B Why wait to use the service until its continuous if it is frictionless and users dont even know they are on NTN? From a user perspectve, it will just seem like they have better service and coverage every launch until one day they are never outside of a service area. They will be beta testing this Fallwinter it seems and I think early subscriptionsrudimentary plans in 2025 will be sold. But yes, you are not wrong to question that.

For people in areas we dont already have cellular service on the regular. For instance, me, and every single person I interact with, has 0 benefit from this service. There ARE people who require it. But immediately assuming right from the get go theyre going to immediately get as many subscribers as ALL of Verizon does? Verizon has 144million subscribers AND IS THE LARGEST of all.... A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE?! Whats your aggressive estimate because Brother the entire USA only has 300million mobile users, what you think every single person is going to drop high speed video and switch to asts provided services? Which again, this is untested and may not ever happen, but if ALL satellite bands are being utilized by different subscribers, the max bandwidth per person is somewhere along the lines of like 250kbsecond if the system is fully utilized. Luckily 99 of the time not everyone will be using it, but still. No way in hell that many people will switch when theyre already ecosystem locked."

Losses are expected to increase slightly, to US$2.19 per share. Yet prior to the latest estimates, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$406m and losses of US$1.79 per share in 2024. So there&#39;s been quite a change-up of views after the recent consensus updates, with the analysts making a serious cut to their revenue forecasts while also expecting losses per share to increase.&#34;\n\nHowever, are these analysts comparing apples to apples. Did the initial estimates include PAR Government and Rome Research revenue and profit? If so, they have been sold, TASK was just purchased and PAR is now a pure play. The focus should be on next year not 2024.\n\nBut, mgt does need to concentrate on true integration, elimination of silos and PROFITABILITY!"
