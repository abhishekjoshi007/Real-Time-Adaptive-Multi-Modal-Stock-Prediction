Yesterdays 5.6 mil volume was 5x normal volume.. Most recent Short Interest (9/30) shows 14.7 mil short, a 1 mil share increase from the prior report (9/13). With the upcoming election, and ER approaching... I think the upward pressure is building and it will be difficult to keep a lid on this stock. I follow Rumble &amp; Chris Pavlovski on Twitter, and I&#39;ve seen nothing but positive reports over the past quarter. They&#39;re successfully executing on multiple fronts, and continually reporting upgrades and enhancements to the UI. Considering the increased censorship and suppression of conservative views on established Big Tech, I see the migration from those platforms to Rumble continuing. As a Rumble user, I noticed multiple ad intrusions while watching my favorite content. Despite my cheapness, I decided to become a subscriber to Rumble Premium... relatively inexpensive, and for me, well worth it to be able to stream my favorites without having to stop every few minutes and skip ads. I don&#39;t think an investment in Rumble is a slam-dunk, but I think they&#39;re moving in the right direction and I&#39;m happy holding on to my investment and adding on weakness."

The upper range is $8.20-$8.35. My guess is that we test that upper trading range before the election results are announced. IF and only IF Trump actually wins this can easily break out to the next level of resistance around $11-12. Short interest of 14 million shares when daily average volume is only around 1 million could actually cause panic short covering squeezing this temporarily into the $13-14 range. Not sure if we got to $13-14 it would hold. But $11-12 range makes sense&#34;"

Personally, I believe you have the right to do that, but I&#39;d prefer that we limit the topic of conversation down to the overall financial health of Rumble so investors, including myself, can get a better idea of what the market sentiment is around this stock and to hear why you feel this stock is a good or bad investment and your reasons for that belief.  Personally, I&#39;m not invested in Rumble, but I&#39;m considering investing simply because if Rumble becomes the success that YouTube has become, then it could mean big money in the long term."
