Reddit,2024-08-20,"NVMI is headquartered in Rehovat, Israel, which was built on the depopulated ruins of the ancient village of Zernuqa. Its like buying a company built on a Native American burial ground. Your calls will be cursed. According to Wikipedia Zarnuqa was depopulated on 2728 May by the Givati Brigade during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War. One account in Al HaMishmar described how a soldier fired with a Sten gun at three people one old man, old woman and a child and how the villagers were taken out from the houses and had to stay in the sun, in hunger and thirst, until they surrendered the weapons they claimed they did not have. They were then expelled towards Yibna. In total, six died and 22 were taken prisoners. The day after, the inhabitants returned and recounted that the Yibna villagers saw them as traitors. The Zarnuqa villagers saw their village being ransacked by Jewish soldiers and nearby settlers. They were expelled again and the houses were demolished the month after.32 The family of the Shaqaqi brothers, Fathi one of the founders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the political scientist Khalil Ibrahim, was from Zarnuqa.33 They fled in the face of rumours of massacres of Palestinians by Yishuv troops and expected to return after the hostilities ended. They were not permitted to come back.5 Haidar Eid, Associate Professor at alAqsa University in Gaza, states that his parent were evicted from the village by members of the Haganah and Stern gang who told them Leave your homes or we will kill and rape you.34",Neutral,0,0.999977707862854,Reply

Yahoo,2024-10-29,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) expects its capital expenditures to increase in 2025 after a hefty 2024 due to artificial intelligence-related demand.

&#34;As the strong, structural AI-related demand continues, we continue to invest to support our customers&#39; growth,&#34; said TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang, during the company&#39;s third quarter 2024 earnings call on Thursday. &#34;We now expect our 2024 capex to be slightly higher than $30B U.S. dollars. Between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies.&#34;

While Huang could not yet provide a capex number for 2025, he indicated it is increasing. He said they can provide more insight on this in January.",Positive,1,0.6119207143783569,Main

Yahoo,2024-10-30,"The semiconductor market is having a stellar 2024, and 2025 looks even better, driven by catalysts such as AI.

2024 is turning out to be a solid year for the global semiconductor industry, driven by multiple catalysts. These include the booming demand for chips that can manage artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, a turnaround in the smartphone market&#39;s fortunes, and a recovery in the personal computer (PC) market.

These factors explain why the global semiconductor industry&#39;s revenue is expected to jump 16% in 2024 to $611.2 billion, according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). That points toward a nice turnaround from last year, when the semiconductor industry&#39;s revenue fell 8%. Even better, the semiconductor space is expected to keep growing in 2025 as well, with WSTS projecting a 12.5% increase in the industry&#39;s earnings to $687.4 billion next year.",Positive,1,1.0,Main
