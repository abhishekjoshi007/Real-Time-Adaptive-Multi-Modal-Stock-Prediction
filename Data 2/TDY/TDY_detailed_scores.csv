Reddit,2024-08-05,"Congrats! I am pretty sure I sold you a few of those 28 calls. I think those are going to be OTM, honestly I was expecting it to go sidewaysdown. But I am glad I still got to sell those high IV OTM calls.",Neutral,0,0.9988245368003845,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-05,"UPDATE Nothing crazy this morning, which I figured given the high IV and most of my contracts being longer dated. Took profit on all contracts. Completely sold the 89s, the 920s, and took some profit on the 11725s. Still holding all my commons and looking to add to the 11626 30cs sometime soon if the markets keep being this frothy",Neutral,0,0.9581791162490845,Reply
