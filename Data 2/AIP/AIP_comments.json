To me, ethically, theres a huge difference between being in an ETF vs making a deliberate choice to buy and own a specific stock. Fortunately, the ETFs Im bought into the most dont feature PLTR though. Im not telling anyone else to sell. Its clearly a good investment and while I made a modest profit, Im confident that the stock will be worth more over the long term, barring unforeseen circumstances. I just had to make a decision that I could live with. I can make money on other investments without feeling like Im deliberately putting money in the pocket of someone who is actively trying to bring about a change in the world I viscerally hate. Before I thought he was just an eccentric, and I could let it pass. People talk, I dont have to completely agree with the people running the companies I invest in. That changed when he pushed to get Vance into a stones throw from the white house as an acolyte of Thiel and Curtis Yarvin, hes the kind of guy who would potentially support a January 6 scenario, instead of balking like Pence did. Have you read into it at all? Thiel is disguising authoritarian technocratic monarchism behind the language of freedom. The ideas these guys toss around about almost everything are repugnant explicitly antiAmerican. Explicitly antidemocratic, antiegalitarian, racist, misogynistic, the list goes on and on. There are models where a kinglike figure acts solely at the pleasure of a council of oligarchs. Another model has the dissolution of nations, and instead cyberpunkstyle city states where different corporations exert absolute control over a city state, and the citizens have no rights whatsoever. The one thing these models all have in common is the removal of rights from ordinary citizens, with absolute power granted to technocrats like Thiel. Like I said, cartoonish, James Bond villain shit. The explicitly talk about these concepts as desirable changes to governance in the future. If you feel good about giving your money to someone who not only buys into those ideas, but is working to bring them about? Be my guest."

It gave me weird vibes...and I was just coming out of DOD contracting work with a secret security clearance so I wasnt new to a world of things you cant talk about but they just seemed to literally not be willing to even explain the job. And I hate Thiel...but the company has decent engineering from what I can tell. EDIT I clearly pissed people off but it is unclear why. Palantir is a creepy company and I dont get why a bunch of people who probably never worked for them or did an interview there can downvote me for telling my experience in like 2012. I have interviewed at tons of software companies both private sector and government jobs that required a secret or top secret clearance and none of them were as vague and shady as palantir. They are successful but I dislike most of what that company stands for and I stunningly dislike their leader."

Stuff like If a companys inhouse data solution is dataFrankenstein, then Palantir is a dataZeus, the god of all data solutions. Means everything and nothing. Truth is, Palantir is Accenture with MBBlevel marketing. Not even 2 years ago there was a companywide ban on AI. Seriously, if you wanted to develop any sort of ML for a client, it had to be developed by a third party. The AI rebranding is a 180 shift on where the company was 18 months ago. As to all the platforms being so great, why did the model adopted roughly 2 years ago of selfserving and moving towards SaaSlike solutions that the customers can just use with no need for consultants fail? Why are Palantir deployments essentially built from scratch? Surely if there is a hospital managing solution that works, it would be very lowlift to use it in nearly any hospital instead of just one, right? Why are there no scalable products released? Like if Apollo, Gotham and Foundry are so much better than the alternatives, why didnt they just release them straight to the customers? Why not become an actual product company? I think we all know the answer to that the product is not scalable, the platforms very laggy and full of bugs. If they released it to the public, any developer would be aware of stuff like how Ontology is just a set of tables linked with foreign keys and the AI positioning is pure marketing."

Sorta that they dont really have some secret sauce algorithm like they claim? I just see a fair amount of posts from engineers saying its a garbage platform like you have, then some that say its good and delivers results and im a little confused. I do admit i am sitting nicely in profit on the last of my PLTR position and am looking where i should take profit on some more of it."

But enterprise customers also benefit heavily from paying for MBBs slides. So there is no need to have stateoftheart software when plenty of companies basically only use email and simple VBA. I think Palantir generates a lot of value for its customers, and rightly so. But if you are using an image of a cuttingedge AI product company for valuation, I am not sure this is the case. You are buying a hype consulting company with perfect marketing and a charismatic leader who is capable of saying controversial stuff, not an AI champion with a suite of AI products and a history of having toptier ML talent. Maybe the valuation of this company should be even higher. But it is not a product company, but an implementation center. Just for comparison, Palantir has been around nearly as long as MetaFacebook. Meta released Llama, uses AI extensively and has published plenty of AI research. Palantir has bigname customers. So it is still the implementation that gets paid for, rather than the product. What would you say is the more scalable company that actually showed their AI skills?"

Their positioning as a cutting edge AI firm has certainly at least been believed by these big names and of course has led to a valuation multiple much higher than what the market would give them and indeed perhaps more than they deserve than if they were perceived instead as a consulting firm. So really, I agree with your take regarding this but also believe that any rational leadership would strive to maintain such an image for the above reasons. I think a big litmus test will be to what extent their clients can demonstrably improve their bottom line from their products longterm, and if its material enough, then the market may not care about how truly an AI champion they really are. Of course, I think all that would be predicated on the scalability of their products which I didnt realize was such an issue before reading your earlier point. I cant imagine that issue not being a major focus for the firm to improve upon. One other point thats interesting though is that I dont think any company could acquire and integrate them fluidly and it appears by extension that they may have a pretty reliable moat in terms of intellectual capital and product offering. Any long term opinion of them? Addressing your question, Meta of course is much more scalable but I dont know how direct of a comp they are for PLTR just in terms of market cap, product mix, and of course different customer and geographic base."

They are not trying to sell the implementation of their solution, they are trying to grow out the infrastructure of their platforms Gotham, Foundry, etc as well as their more scalable AIP platform. This will generate reoccurring revenues from several of their clients. The biggest key factor is their 20 year head start in a field that is just starting to gain use cases commercially in the last 5 years. They have developed a ridiculous MOAT in the data analytics field, using their head start while being funded by the government. Several of the largest tech companies have partnered with them to offer PLTRs platforms on top of their own services. Now you can see them growing with successful use cases from a variety of fields being presented at AIP conference. They are bottom line profitable and growing revenuescustomer base in this challenging capital environment. I believe companies are realizing the benefits of PLTRs offerings are even more valuable during these challenging times where access to capital is more expensive and streamlining their businesses is crucial to navigate."
