You will see what an elevator going straight down looks like.  Blackrock will dump all of this garbage.  Many other smart funds would do so as well.  You can tell much from people about their posts.  You can tell who is experienced and whom is a loser.  I always ask why someone says what to do or a price if they give zero analysis or reasons.  Pumpers are a dime a dozen and easy to spot.  Losers live in the past.Winners live in the now and they give reasons.  Reasons and educated reasoning is so much better.  Lazz&#39;s life is horrible.  Anyone that lives in the past and is always so angry needs to dump the boyfriend and go straight.  I bet he gets beat up by his BF and that is why he is always so angry.  Remember to vote if American and vote for Trump. He is so much better for stocks and normal life again."

I have made more on this in a few weeks than lazz has his whole life in all stocks.  A punk trying to act important and yet he is not experienced enough to know when to sell and lock in gains.  I could write a book about trading and what to look for.  The charts tells all much.  I have said it before.. Charts, volume and price.  Follow those three to see direction of a stock.  I believe in karma which is why I try for free to help you animals out.  Stephen lying about his buds saying low volume after a huge run is bullish.  Where do you people come from?  Stock has been on a downward angle for weeks.  I pointed this out and every other technical analaysis to say to sell and go short.Lazz please be so angry.  Please be so jealous.

My initial AMD investment was in 2016 and started what has made me wealthy beyond my wildest dreams. I followed Warren Buffet’s direction that concentrated investments create wealth and diversification protects wealth.  I sold a lot of AMD in my IRAs in an arbitrage move and bought XLNX which was then acquired by AMD, increasing my AMD holdings.  I cashed out half of my AMD and bought real estate and large holdings in other stocks including AAOI and COHR.  AAOI will, I believe, start the cycle all over again and could make me more than AMD did if projections become reality.  Meanwhile bubbles frantically tries to time the market and makes and loses lunch money. Such a clown 🤡."

If it does, sell anytime it gets up .85 cents or more because there is no staying power now with those gains.  Immediately sell and short it back down.

It was positive YTD intraday at $20 recently but didn’t close positive. The next step after that is taking out the 52 week high. I think you need good guidance in early November for that to happen.

He reminds me of the temperament of a plumber or road flagger.  Always angry and always wanting to make excuses more than those though is the jealousy.  He so wants to be me I am told by many."

I said it would roll over with the markets.Tomorrow the markets will be down big in the morning.  This will get crushed.if you want to make money.  Read my posts and follow.  Today was a huge day for me and you all saw it live.  Do not be mad and do not be jealous.  Just realize there are pros out there that do this for a living.Charts are key as well as following the price action and the volume.  Those 3 things tell so much about the future of the stock.  When it sold off yesterday on high volume, it was guaranteed to get clobbered because funds starting to lock in massive gains.  This ran so much so fast in a couple of weeks.  The tell was how it neared that high yesterday the amount of selling.  Tomorrow will be rough.  Just accept it.  Too late to short now so  you will just have to live through me I guess.To those that made money today, I salute you as your leader"

I want all to make money but if you get jealou when I make money and your posts are angry.  You get blockedAdd value to the board so others can make money. If all you do is post negativity.  You get blockedRead and comprehend posts and do not be so ignorant.  Not doing this gets you blocked.The trend on AAOI is down now.  That is why I said at close I will sell my long shares and short it.  The days low was probably hit and smart money covered and went long.  However the trend is down right now.  Just like all stocks do not go straight up all stocks do not go straight down.  Volatility makes a guy like me a lot of money.  Not understanding my moves after I post them, gets you blocked esp when I give the reasons on why.  I said AAOI based off of yesterdays action needed to cool off and shorted into the close.  Now this mornings sell off was brutal and overdone for the DAY.  So covering and going long was the play for the DAY.  It is how money is made.  Remember these rules or get BLOCKED"

Once they finish getting their number of shares, this will sell off about 20%.  The key tell is the volume.  To be a successful trader, you must know what to look for.  Or you can be a fool like Laz and passively  hold from 80 to 1.   I like to tell all that great money is made playing a stock that is volatile like a yo yo.  Up and down.  They did triple their space in Taiwan.  They did sell a lot of shares last QTR for CAPEX.  The guidance for the 4th might be a higher than the 98 million being projected.  Why?  They said in 2025 they might be able to do 700 million and they said the tell would be the CAPEX.  Well now they are tripling size of Taiwan.  They raised about 30 million last QTR selling via the ATM.  See this is a very informative post you can use to make money on.  Most of you just have no idea what is pertinent and what isn&#39;t.  Tripling in size your manufacturing is a huge TELL.  I gave that to you all.  Watch and see next QTR you will see 3 million shares were sold via ATM for expansion.  That bodes so good for 2025."

But since they recently mentioned they are heavily investing there they must be doing similar products as they are in Texas but with better margins. They tried to sell that because it was underutilized and they needed cash. Now they need that capacity but selling and then renting would still have been a good idea because they needed that cash. I believe CATV is in Taiwan. Someone mentioned they should not be doing new leases in Taiwan due to China. But they have had a footprint in Taiwan for a while now. It would be expensive to close that down and move elsewhere. I view signing a 15 year lease as a positive. They actually have two manufacturing facilities in Taiwan. I didn’t know they were renting instead of owning for at least one of them. Credo and Coherent are at all time highs. Lite is at a 52 week high."

AMD is going to start taking significant market share from NVDA, and NVDA&#39;s forward PE and P/S is already higher than AMD&#39;s.   When I first started buying AMD a friend who worked for NVDA told me I should buy NDVA stock.  It was $12 at the time, split adjusted to $.30.  AMD was $2.  I didn&#39;t buy NVDA, and missed the run of a lifetime.  But that&#39;s history.  I think AMD has a better chance of hitting $250 than NVDA does hitting $200, but I&#39;ve been wrong before ."

And that&#39;s after watching it every day for several months and waiting for the entry point.So, what are you going to attack me on now?I didn&#39;t even use my 12.50 &#34;watch price&#34; to trigger a sale at 12.50 because I know algorithms going to push through that exact value. Yes, I&#39;m not the only one who knows that 12.50 was a stop loss value for many. I guess I&#39;m not a chart gazer after all like you claim. The algos will destroy you if that&#39;s all you trade on.What else do you want to debate?"

You have to watch 12.50 on the low side and 17 on the high side. The rest is just noise unless you want to day trade.Note Lazerator, these are NOT &#34;made up price values&#34;. And what happens next? Well if 12.50 fails then expect more downside and if 17 gets broken to the upside, then higher prices will sustain.My best guess is that a triangle formation will establish itself in the current range and then break to one side or the other. Is that clear enough for you Lazerator? And is that telling you something you know after it&#39;s already happened?"

They always tun in the red and that is not how good companies operate.  If they are selling this many to increase capacity because the ORDERS are there from customers no biggy.  If they are selling because the orders never materialized and they need the money to pay the bills, this company will not exist in a few more years.   The share count just keeps going up a lot every year.Only company that is not profitable during the AI boom years.  Its crazy how incompetence destroys shareholders.  If they do not pre announce earnings to the upside around mid October (they used to in the boom year of 17) then expect a big miss and stick gets crushed.Murray and lin remind me of biden taking questions.  If those orders do not materialize now the street is down giving them the benefit of the doubt.  I just get that feeling this QTr willl be bad and they will try and sugarcoat yet again by talking 25 but it will plummet.  That is expert analysis.  That is something you can trade on!"

AAOI is in the sweet spot for revenue growth and will stay there for many years into the future.&#39;&#39;Oracle had 85 data centers up and running with 77 more under construction as of its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), but Ellison thinks it could operate as many as 2,000 in the long term.In fact, Oracle spent $6.9 billion on data center infrastructure in fiscal 2024, and it plans to double that figure in fiscal 2025. But it gets better.Tesla will spend $10 billion on that infrastructure, but it&#39;s going to need more capacity over time.Microsoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures (capex) mostly relating to AI infrastructure during its fiscal 2024 year (ended June 30), and it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Similarly, Amazon&#39;s capex spending is on track to top $60 billion this calendar year.&#39;&#39;Granted AAOI is tiny company but they&#39;ll get as big a piece of this action as they can supply.Bringing us back to the major question....what capacity do they have available (because they are going to need it).To this end they hinted at 500M to 600M in possible annual revenue for 2025....so they must have that kind of capacity currently available."

But until they show evidence of that I’m sticking with 2026."

He said that was if the market cooperated which it did. The Nasdaq kept climbing for months. In February AAOI issued disappointing guidance for Q1 and the stock dropped to $12 overnight. Michael has claimed that these sorts of events are already baked into the charts and the charts know everything.  So his charts telling him the stock was going to double were clearly bogus. Notice that he won’t tell us where the charts are saying the stock is likely to go now except that he turned bullish. He’ll wait until something happens and then claim it was obvious beforehand.  That’s what he’s done ever since stalking me here two years ago from the COHR board."

If you used charts you could have avoided the massive 37% decline. Do you have any idea how to read a chart? Was that part of you vast engineering (LOL ^3) education? The idea is you sell at higher levels when the chart momentum goes negative. Then you wait for the lower buy point as others are cheerleading on a message board and attacking those who point out the stock is in a big &#34;FALLING KNIFE&#34; chart pattern. Then you buy back those shares at 10 when the momentum goes back to positive.Do you get it? What&#39;s next? The chart is bullish for now. When it flips to negative (i.e., after another kick the can down the road earnings report) then I&#39;ll post that."

I think it went positive after it bottomed at $6.70 on August 7, at least that&#39;s what it looks like to me. So if it peaks and drops 2-3 dollars he&#39;ll probably tell us that the chart &#34;momentum turned negative&#34;. We will have already figured that out ourselves.  I don&#39;t recall him telling us at $21 that the stock was going to drop to $12.  It dropped to $14s almost overnight.  With good Q4 guidance I think we could see $20+ again by EOY.  Remember insiders bought heavily at $12+ and Rosenblatt has a price target of $20."

Apple had a huge surge in sales when they debuted the iPhone 6 which had comparable screen sizes as Samsung phones. People tend to stay with the same phones when they upgrade due to familiarity.

Rich people like to be in cash and stocks. They hold treasuries to protect their wealth. They keep saying that the amount of available cash (usually treasuries or money market funds) are at an all time high. The stock market competes directly with the bond market. More cash will be put in the stock market as yields go down. You still can get yields over the inflation rate. That won’t last long. Usually the stock market is up double digits a year after the first cut. As someone has said here the first cut may be a sign that the country is in recession and the Fed was too late with interest rate cuts. So the overall reaction to the cut can be negative at first. We are not in a recession. Housing equity is at an all time. The complete opposite of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In 2019 housing was much more affordable and inflation was low. Everyone wants 2019 again. Housing and general prices are not going back to 2019. But inflation is trending down from very high levels."

Some clueless people don&#39;t believe it, because they don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on.  They&#39;re tech illiterate and are too busy looking at past charts to see the explosive growth coming.   I see AMD exploding like NVDA did, and AAOI may do what it did in 2017 with a lot less revenue.  If they hit just $500M in 2025 with a 14% net margin we&#39;re looking at at least a $50-60 stock.  There&#39;s been talk of $700M+ next year.   Q4 guidance will tell the tale.  If they guide low, there&#39;s something wrong."

I’ve never seen a company give guidance so far out before. So they have a lot of conviction about data center revenue going forward. And they said telecom has stopped going down but they don’t see growth either. AAOI has said the exact same thing about telecom but it’s around $3 million in revenue per quarter so it’s pretty meaningless. I think companies in the sector thought they were going to make a lot of money for 5G in China. That doesn’t seem possible now due to trade issues. AAOI has said similar things about data center for 2025 also. What Lite said was bullish for AAOI. The execution only matters. 2025 should be about 800G. 2026 should be about 1.6T. But if the stock becomes parabolic like last year I may have to sell irregardless of good fundamentals."

If one bothers to look, that drop coincided with a drop in the Nasdaq and virtually all of the chip and AI stocks.  The recent runup was caused by an upgraded price target to $20 and a market bounce.  Nothing can predict where the stock will be in the future but we know revenue is expected to begin a strong climb in Q4 and continue through 2025.  That’s what drives the stock price not where it was last week or a month ago.  Looking forward to Q4 guidance in a few weeks."

Remember, we&#39;re dealing with a stock that has plummeted from the 20s down to 6.70 from February.

But I think shorting is extremely dangerous because your losses could be unlimited. I held the stock during the downturn. I didn’t lose any money because I didn’t sell. I have not made any money yet because I have not sold. But if I sold today I would make a profit. I’m not selling because the stock is cheap and November guidance is going to be up huge sequentially. I think the second most dangerous thing to do is buying with margin money. Then you can’t hold the stock during an extreme downturn because they take your shares away. As I said before, I don’t care about today’s stock price. I’m really going to care in 2025. I think you are a contrarian indicator. The more you post the higher the stock goes. I’m not trying to disrespect you. All of these negative posts started coming out when the stock ran to $24. Shorts were losing their shirts. This is a heavily shorted stock. I don’t know if a short squeeze is happening on any particular day because I have no proof of it. But I know it’s a huge factor."

Yes, AAOI has pretty consistently hit their guidance range.  Stock is up 82% in a month.  Remember when everyone was whining at $7?  They should have been buying.  And I still don&#39;t believe that the stock dropped to $6.70 due to the ATM.  Look at the AMD and COHR and Nasdaq charts at that time."

If the stock keeps running maybe they will be forced to upgrade. Or maybe they are waiting for guidance in November. If they hit Rosenblatt’s estimates at $98 million the stock will be flying based on profitability alone. Their price to sales ratio will go up because of profitability. Maybe not like Credo because they have so much cash. AAOI has consistently met their estimates albeit at much lower revenue numbers."

It’s totally about management. Microsoft floundered when Steve Balmer was the CEO. I remember him deriding the first iPhone. I held the first generation iPhone in my hand and I knew everything was going to change. It was so obvious. Bill Gates and the current Microsoft CEO begged Balmer not to buy Nokia. He didn’t listen. AI didn’t happen overnight. Nvidia started working on AI about 11 years ago. It was all about GPU’s instead of the CPU’s that Intel specialized in. Xilinx was a GPU company like Nvidia and were direct competitors. AMD bought Xilinx. Apple’s computers got a lot faster when they ditched Intel and started designing their own chips. I think the presentation for the AI iPhone 16 was today. I didn’t get a chance to listen to it. But I’m definitely considering buying one. Intel and Cisco’s stock price has not done much since the dot com era 24 years ago. That’s definitely not the case with Microsoft but Balmer had to leave first."

Just a thought. \nOn the positive, AAOI is using the ATM at a decent price which we should all appreciate"

That’s not enough for a company with such a high valuation. Even with their great balance sheet. So it’s down sharply after hours. Maybe AAOI will continue on a higher trajectory compared to Credo. \nCredo’s margins are much better than AAOI. But AAOI has been doing heavy R and D for data center which has impacted margins and the expenses for ramping CATV this quarter as well. Credo has limited competition in the AEC space. But the AOC longer range market and the accompanying transceivers is far larger I believe. Even with more competition in that space companies in that sector still can’t satisfy demand. \nAAOI is still a cheep stock based on what will hopefully happen by the end of the year. Credo recently had a $6 billion market cap. How could they ever exceed that with the kind of current revenue they have? \nDSP’s are still a tiny part of their revenues. So I don’t think I could glean anything off that that could apply to AAOI which is presumably a customer. There is nothing wrong with Credo per se. 10% sequential growth is fine. But it’s not an attractive stock in my opinion."

I think you mentioned job openings for highly skilled workers currently. What kind of jobs were they? The stock is still very cheap compared to its peers. We now know the ATM caused the stock to go from $12 to $6. My only concern now is dilution. AAOI said they had $18 million in cash at their last CC. Is that enough to last when they reach profitability during the last calendar quarter of this year? They did say they were going to have expenses ramping CATV in the current quarter. Two things have to happen during the last quarter. No more dilution and profitability. At analyst’s projections of $98 million for that last quarter both things can be achieved. Lite on their last CC mentioned they were going to stop making DSP’s. They took a pretty heavy markdown because of that. They said they no longer want to invest in it. They also said they can buy at reasonable prices from other suppliers. Just like AAOI is buying from Credo presumably. Credo said that only 10% of their revenues come from selling DSP’s. I thought it would be a higher percentage of their revenues. Perhaps it will if Lite becomes their customer. The point I’m making is there is no reason for AAOI to develop their own DSP’s."

It is too heavily shorted and any sign of earnings and revenue growth will toast the shorts. UPSTs initial jump was from $23 to $28 with the earnings report and now it just hit $42. Resistance melts away quickly with heavily shorted stocks and then you get momentum players coming in. Overall the market though is acting as weird as the Orange guy running for President. Energy is down which is why Powell is talking about easing."

If it’s a half a point instead of a quarter it might spook the markets for a short while because that means the Fed may see signs of conditions getting really worse. I anticipate a .25 quarter cut in September and another in November. I know the Fed rarely makes a change right when there is a presidential election. They may have to. However, I don’t believe it will be an issue if it’s well telegraphed that they plan to do that at their September meeting. It takes a while for Fed cuts to make a difference but the markets could go up on that second cut because it’s forward looking. It’s already had a positive reaction to the Fed chair indicating a rate cut in September. If the Fed has to cut because we’re facing a recession then the markets won’t react positively at first but ultimately will. The average recession lasts 289 days. But I don’t see AI slowing anyway. Lite said something very interesting on their CC. They said telecom has bottomed but they don’t see any growth at all as far as they can see. AAOI has virtually no exposure to telecom."

They paid off some debt during that time which I think was a smart decision. Even with the stock dilution they still have a small market cap and I believe is cheap especially compared to a company like Credo which has a similar trajectory but has a whopping $6 billion market cap. The benefit of owning AAOI is it could easily double their market cap in a short time period on good news. That would be harder for Credo. Credo has a higher market cap because they have tons of cash. AAOI doesn’t. If AAOI is profitable in the last quarter in this calendar year the stock will take off. And the dilution will have to stop as well. If that happens we get a short squeeze. They basically guided inline revenues for the current quarter. No reason that should not happen next quarter. If the stock market does well AAOI should ride along with it if they slow or stop their dilution. Their margins have suffered due to heavy R and D in 800G and 1.6T last quarter and ramping CATV in the current quarter. I have high hopes for late this year and 2025. The hyper scalers need product so I don’t think demand is an issue. AAOI’s margins should rebound as well. You want to invest in a company that is investing heavily in itself. Even if it means short term pain."

Rosenblatt earlier this year said they could hit $750M to $1B in 2025 and Murry said there&#39;s an &#34;opportunity&#34; for $500-800M but that wasn&#39;t really guidance.    Once they show that they can meet the high end or beat guidance in Q3 and guide much higher for Q4, the stock will take off imo.

For the close followers over the longer term- would it be a stretch to think that AAOI can become one of the top 3 in the 800 and 1.6 space serving hyperscalers in 2025/2026? Do they have the ability to become #1 or #2? If so, what would it take for them to forge that path and realize a leadership role? My sense so far is that they would have to exit a comfort zone that they seem to operate in (which would entail some internal change/risk and dedicating themselves to a specific path).  While I would like to see them make a big move while the market opportunity seems to be there, I am also perfectly happy as an investor if they just stay in their zone and pay attention to blocking and tackling.  They will be lifted by the market in this case, and it may be the safer play for them.  Would be interested to see what others think."

I heard of two companies shipping 800g and both just started ramping this year with $250 million last quarter (Coherent and Fabrinet).   Murry still thinks there could be some 800g revenue in q3 and reaffirmed that $800M to $1 billion was still a possibility for 2025.   He wasn’t saying it would definitely happen but it was possible given the market.  He also said these products will be in demand for years so it’s not like anyone’s missing the boat if they’re not first to market. Q4 should be the turning point for AAOI and if they push revenue growth expectations out further they’re not a serious contender."

Of these design wins, two were for our 400G products, both with existing hyperscale data center operator customers. We also had two wins for our 100G products with hyperscale customers. We had two 100G wins with network equipment manufacturers supplying the data center industry.The remaining two design wins were in our FTTH telecom and others category. We continue to see good customer traction on 400G, and we expect orders will ramp up in the second half of this year. On our Q1 call, we have discussed how a major hyperscale data center customer selected AOI as a vendor for several of our 400G products.

But since they already made GM of more than 30% on Q3 &amp; Q4 of 2023 with revenue of ~62M, so to get back to above 30% GM, look like to me is probably no big deal since the incoming selling products are high margin-Its manufacturing capacity in Sugarland Texas is vertical with automation was put into played several years already in anticipate of big production.-AI related CapEx from several Big Hyperscalers (their ER reports) are going to get larger from now into 2025 with infrastructure like fiber optical connectivity 4) We can NEVER get exactly all the information out of management since they also be dictated by large customersSo my 2 cents is just look at all the information and make your bet..."

That is way too many people with knowledge about how AAOI is going as it relates to getting and filling orders. So that is why the charts are almost always accurate about the future and why short interest is so HIGH. You do not think microsoft execs talk and say they are slowing ramping of products, therefore AAOI gets hit with a short. Same with cable companies. If I worked at the cable company as an exec and I know the rollout was going slower than expected. I am shorting AAOI and telling family and friends to short it.This is why charts are so beneficial to understanding the health of a company esp one with so many large customers.  Any slow down is an opportunity for many to make money outside of insider trading.Today was a GIVEN because charts told that this QTR was bad and would disappoint.  I knew to short last night when the price action PM was sustained and volume was weak on that pop.  I called these trades perfectly because of charts.This is going to 5  and maybe lower.  AAOI needs to show AI is real for them and that orders need to be created and AAOI needs to fill them.  Until that this is a bust stock."

They have an active deal with Raymond James for 25M dollars.  If massive growth is really about to hit they&#39;ll need some cash to see it through.  Profits will come last (Q1 next year probably) so they&#39;ll need some cash.In Q1 they only sold 270K shares (around $14 a share generating around 4M) but odds are they did more of that in Q2 and then in July.The share count jumped from 28M to 38M the last 4 quarters so they&#39;ve been busying raising cash (although they also did a convertible for 80M).What does this mean?It means management is expecting growth to show up and show up pretty fast (starting in Q3 and continuing for years to come).    The share price has clearly been held down by their own stock sales (and delayed orders) but it appears those trends will be coming to an end soon (hopefully they raised enough through Q2 and into July to cover growth needs for the rest of the year).My guess is for Q2 the numbers come in around what they guided to but Q3 will not be the massive jump (40M to 65M) expected by analysts.  I&#39;m thinking they guide to closer to mid 50M and then paint a bright picture for Q4 and beyond."

Only exception would be if they all of a sudden start doing regular PR and announcing wins, but that is doubtful.Q3 earnings, or maybe Q4 early next year will be when this thing starts to climb for good."
