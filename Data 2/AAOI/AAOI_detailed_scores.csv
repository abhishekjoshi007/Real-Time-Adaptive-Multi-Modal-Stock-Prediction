Yahoo,2024-09-16,Lite predicted that their quarterly revenues would be $500 million by the end of 2025. Their current revenues are in the low $300 million range. I’ve never seen a company give guidance so far out before. So they have a lot of conviction about data center revenue going forward. And they said telecom has stopped going down but they don’t see growth either. AAOI has said the exact same thing about telecom but it’s around $3 million in revenue per quarter so it’s pretty meaningless. I think companies in the sector thought they were going to make a lot of money for 5G in China. That doesn’t seem possible now due to trade issues. AAOI has said similar things about data center for 2025 also. What Lite said was bullish for AAOI. The execution only matters. 2025 should be about 800G. 2026 should be about 1.6T.

That’s not enough for a company with such a high valuation. Even with their great balance sheet. So it’s down sharply after hours. Maybe AAOI will continue on a higher trajectory compared to Credo. 
Credo’s margins are much better than AAOI. But AAOI has been doing heavy R and D for data center which has impacted margins and the expenses for ramping CATV this quarter as well. Credo has limited competition in the AEC space. But the AOC longer range market and the accompanying transceivers is far larger I believe. Even with more competition in that space companies in that sector still can’t satisfy demand. 
AAOI is still a cheep stock based on what will hopefully happen by the end of the year. Credo recently had a $6 billion market cap. How could they ever exceed that with the kind of current revenue they have? 
DSP’s are still a tiny part of their revenues. So I don’t think I could glean anything off that that could apply to AAOI which is presumably a customer. There is nothing wrong with Credo per se. 10% sequential growth is fine. But it’s not an attractive stock in my opinion.",Positive,1,0.999829888343811,Main

The first is the markets don&#39;t believe those numbers are coming.  Don&#39;t think anyone can make the case their current market cap reflects the possibility of a 100M plus revenue Q4 or annual revenue north of 500M next year....at 40% margins.

Yahoo,2024-08-03,While you never know why the share price ran up from near 7 to 12 a few weeks back and then cratered right back down the odds to me point to their  ATM offering.  They have an active deal with Raymond James for 25M dollars.  If massive growth is really about to hit they&#39;ll need some cash to see it through.  Profits will come last (Q1 next year probably) so they&#39;ll need some cash.In Q1 they only sold 270K shares (around $14 a share generating around 4M) but odds are they did more of that in Q2 and then in July.The share count jumped from 28M to 38M the last 4 quarters so they&#39;ve been busying raising cash (although they also did a convertible for 80M).What does this mean?It means management is expecting growth to show up and show up pretty fast (starting in Q3 and continuing for years to come).    The share price has clearly been held down by their own stock sales (and delayed orders) but it appears those trends will be coming to an end soon (hopefully they raised enough through Q2 and into July to cover growth needs for the rest of the year).My guess is for Q2 the numbers come in around what they guided to but Q3 will not be the massive jump (40M to 65M) expected by analysts.
