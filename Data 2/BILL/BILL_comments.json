Biomed always feels too risky. Is this company placing all their eggs in this basket or are they well diversified?

Because productivity growth continues, especially in the US, earnings growth is also expected, which will drive prices higher. While there is a large swath of households and individuals struggling to make ends meet, poverty continues to decrease Extreme poverty for example, those suffering malnutrition and without heated shelter has decreased from over 60 to under 20 around the world in the past 100 years. Our poverty definitions need to shift for example, indoor plumbing, internet access, etc with the progress made in reducing poverty, but certainly, people can feel that the world is doomed, even if the data demonstrates the opposite. Tricky politicians will tell you that household wages are stagnant, but they wont tell you that household sizes are shrinking, so that they can anger voters about things getting worse, when in fact they are getting better. We all know that life is unfair, and that tragedy strikes hard, and it is hard not to take it personally. But the data is the data, the truth is the truth. Stock ownership is also a way to capture both real and nominal inflationary gains. While there are no guarantees that the next 100 years will be anything like the last 100, one path towards generational wealth is to invest a cup of coffee a day for 50 years, and end up with more than 1 million by doing so.

Stock market is purely a reflection on how profitable set of companies and industries are doing. Profitable is the main factor. The stock market overall rises and falls with just how well or bad MSFT, AMAZ, NVIDIA, etc do that day. You and I might be feeling pinched by inflation, but the economic reports say that consumer spending hasnt gone down, its just shifting from one commodity to another. McDonalds stock is down, others are going up. When WAR, global pandemic, natural disaster interrupts key industries like energy, everything tanks. The one example I learned a lot from was a few years ago a single boat blocked the Panama Canal for like 2 weeks I think. that issue dropped the markets worldwide 35 .

So, its not all lovely but it is not all doom and gloom as the OP opinioned either."

And its not even keeping pace with an average year. For 2024 so far, the monthly average real wage growth has been approximately 0.14. Its usually 0.2 You want to call this growth? On top of that, they had a near record low response rate of 62 for the Current Employment Statistics CES survey. Did you know the BLS just estimates for the people who dont respond? So that one month of data is half a guess. That aside, it wasnt 1.3 at all. I guess you didnt read the rest of your source? The change in real average hourly earnings combined with a decrease of 0.3 percent in the average workweek resulted in a 0.9percent increase in real average weekly earnings over this period. And heres the other key thing in the part you did read Real average hourly earnings increased 1.3 percent, seasonally adjusted, from August 2023 to August 2024. The BLS just seasonally adjusted September more than they have since 2002 in the jobs report. The BLS also revised away 818,000 of the jobs they claimed that were created last year.

Youve provided two sources one which disproved your assertion that wages had grown 1.3 when it clearly said 0.9 and that was seasonally adjusted and your other source shows that wages have not grown at all theyve barely kept up with inflaton. The page says wage growth was lower than inflation during a critical period in 20212022 means that real wages fell for most workers during that time, even as nominal wages climbed. It also stated many households struggling with the cost of essentials like rent, housing, and food, which continue to rise faster than wage gains for many workers. I gave you 20 data points and offered 31 more. 4 of those points of data are positive. If you have any to add, please do. So far, Im not getting much besides a lot of hand waving and selfcontradictory sources. Anyway, anyway, the reason the stock market has been hitting new highs is that the doom and gloom description of our wrecked economy is not true. This is wildly inaccurate. The stock market and economy often have a VERY wide divergence you did see 20202021, right?. Further, the tendacy for the market to hit ATH at the beginning stages of a recessionbefore a market correctioncrash is well documented. You know what else happened right before the economy and market blew up in 2000 and 2007? A blockbuster BLS jobs report. Im not saying history repeats, Im saying that looking at one monthly report of data and claiming it supports that the economy is in great shape is absoluely and demonstrably fool hardy."

There are more trading choices out there that go long for 16 months or go short for 16 months. I swing trade the market and have zero interest in claiming to be a bull or bear. Animal idolatry doesnt interest me. Im here for the money. I just successfully traded the up and downtrend in China, the Japan carry trade unraveling, and predicting the 2022 crash sorry, correction was profitable too. My positions are publicly posted. Currently I hold a majority of shorts market and company specifics, yield based trades that are a nobrainer, and a limited about of consumer staples positions which Ill add to when it makes sense. For now, theyre a plan to capitalize on the markets concerns about inflation. Im not sure I need to ask and correct me if Im wrong, but Im assuming youre a buyhold, DCA, nonequal weighted index fund ETF guy who takes swings at individual companies once in a while if at all based on very basic research. There are millions of you. Anyway, I dont always win but I definitely have progresessed beyond thinking the stock market always goes up or always goes down. Im not sure what your list is about. I said there were 4 positive points. 16 negative. If you think the economy is thriving based on the data I gave you, I dont know that you should be talking about macroeconomics at all. 75 good, 25 bad and youre going with good? And, again, I didnt even give you the 30 real estate market indicators none of which were positive happy to do that if youd like. Worth considering Historically, when inflastion peaks and rolls over, its a precursor to widespread unemployment in 1224 months. Go look it up. the job growth numbers were positive as I said, but worth noting that theyre from an organization that was off 30 annually and has revised numbers down almost every month until now when they seasonally adjusted in a way they havent done in 2 decades. Low unemployment is also interesting if you want to dig into it. Looking beyond the basic U3 number is a start. Or dig into the effects of Fed hikes on the economy most notably that each 100bps hike typically results in unemployment rising 0.5 1 around 1218 months later the Fed itself notes this. So, after 550bps worth of hikes, unemployment has only gone up 0.2 instead of 25? I guess this time is just different? As far as wage growth goes, we just had a protracted conversation about the fact that wages by your words have barely kept up with inflation and we have not broken even with pandemicinflation losses. If I could offer you any advice it would be that there is no harm in being wrong. For me, its a great thing to discover. Thats when I get to learn. Best of luck. Buy and hold for life. Stocks always go up. You got this."

Then I roundup all the data publicly and see what it says. Earnings are nice but essentially irrelvant if macroeconomic trends gut the whole economy. And earnings are not great right now. A lot of companies are doing well but some key companies are faltering. Pepsi just released earnings citing declining demand and they are a consumer staples company. I maintain my bullish stance as company earnings continue to show me my path forward. You have a bullish stance based on... jargon? An opinion? Cool.

Nowadays, SPY and other various SP500 trackers literally hoover up peoples personal savings, from across the globe. Even on countries like mine England where pensions are more powerful than the US, around 23 of the population invests in the stock market, most people set it and forget it on an automatic monthly investing schedule. The top two ETFs people go for here is VWRP and VUAG, the first one being an all world tracker with 23 of its weight in the SP 500, and the second one just being a straight up SP 500 tracker. And this is in the U.K we dont invest in the FTSE 100, Japanese people arent investing in the Nikkei, mainland Europeans arent investing in the STOXX 50, etc. Everyone across the globe invests one way or another in the US stock market, specifically SP 500. Most people arent active trader types, they just have a monthly direct debit so it automatically buys into the SP 500 for them every month. Even 10 years ago this wasnt really much of a thing. But with investingbroker apps being so mainstream and easy to access on phones, theres massive amounts of people investing in the US stock market. Much more so than there was in the era of the GFC or the dot com bubble. Like I said, nowadays it is literally the global hoover of everyones personal savings. This has got to contribute atleast in some way to inflated PEs because much more people want to buy into it now than ever before."

If more money comes in it has to go somewhere the mag 7 and sp 500 is a self fulfilling prophecy in this respect. In demand companies get more attention which increases the premium on their shares, combine that with the set it and forget it invest in everything with the highest market cap index investing which is the most popular these days and you have an increase in overall PE as the largest weighted companies demand even more money from every dollar put into broad market index funds as the attention and short term performance attracts more growth investors. Ever heard of APA Corporation? How about Catalent Inc? Well if you bought any SP500 index fund you bought a little bit of that too. everyone has. So theres a little bump on the premium for those smaller companies there too and as the heavy weighted companies eat up market cap and consolidate with other like minded successful enterprises through MA you get a lower quality bottom of the list than you had previously, except theyre being bought more aggressively than a long time ago by passive investors who buy the market. The introduction of ETFs, the move to defined contribution from defined benefit retirement plans, and the increased popularity of retail investing created a brand new environment in the market never seen before. Unlike the Great Recession, Great Depression and tech crash, these are not bubbles as much as they are paradigm shifts in how we as a society invest our personal wealth. The market is simply more busy with more players than it has ever been before. That may be something to consider when looking at the increased PE you mentioned. As for the banks and their losses. These treasuries they hold are the safest investments you can purchase. As such, the banks have the ability to mark to maturity if they can verify their full intent to hold them to maturity. While your right that if there is a bank run there could be forced liquidation and trouble, your wrong in saying there are unrealized losses on their books because these losses cant materialize in the first place. Regardless, as interest rates are cut these t notes will increase in value. Now for interest rates. The printing of money does not itself create inflation and the inflation phenomenon is not as simple a supply and demand like many think. The increased supply of money does not create less demand for it and as a result increase prices. Its increased credit that promotes consumer spending and increased government spending that adds money to the private sector that creates inflation. So to say rate cuts are not possible is not all that accurate and it really depends on whether and when we will arrive at the feds neutral interest rate."

Our deficit is concerning but not as big of a problem as media makes it in my opinion... the US dollar is the worlds reserve currency, currencies are pegged to our dollar and central banks hold our dollar in reserves. The chances of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA defaulting on its debt anytime soon is little to none imo ofc. Political division has always been there and as long as its not WW3 global tensions wont make countries hate us more than they already do lol. Also, were not Argentina lol. We have a sound banking system and print money effectively even though we go over the budget and were still in good shape.

People from across the globe dont chose the SP 500 because theyre a big fan of America, they chose it because theres nowhere else in the globe that offers such a good mix of massive growth stocks and matured global mega corps. For example, I will never invest in the UKs FTSE 100 because its comprised of very matured and boring companies that see almost no growth, its the same case with Europe. Banks and Insurance dominates. Ive spoken to people from Hong Kong and China who rather invest in the SP over their countries indexes for similar reasons and also because you can be certain that business will always be stable in the US, you cant say that for ChinaIndia etc. Basically, america is just the most attractive place in the world to invest in because it sees the best growth whilst also being the most reliable and stable. You think a world ending 20 crash for the SP 500 is bad, look at the SP China 500. Roughly 28 in 2018, 52 crash from 20212022. Indias Nifty 50 has performed really well and stable actually, but even so, theyll invest in the US. Until America stops seeing monster growth mixed in with matured mega corps and pretty much unrivalled economic stability and security, people wont stop pouring their savings into it. And the strongest military in the world defends that economys interests. Also a side note, I dont see the US stock markets growth elements dying any time soon either, largely because the best and brightest workers and entrepreneurs in the world all go to America because A the best and brightest workers get paid better and B the entrepreneurs with ideas for the next big thing go to America because its the easiest place to get Venture Capital funding, its the startup capital of the world. Conversely, this is an issue for the U.K. and Europe I know of this first hand, and likely India and China aswell, because theres a thing called brain drain. Its a real issue in my country and all of Europe, and its basically the concept I just explained. Our nations smartest people leave us to go to America because they can get double, triple the pay if not more. Hence the name brain drain, the US hoovers up all the smart people in the world. So I dont personally think that people will lose confidence in the US stock market any time soon simply for the fact that I dont see any other country becoming a more attractive place to invest in any time soon Americas closest rival is china, and no one wants to touch Chinese stocks with a 10 foot barge pole relatively speaking ofcourse."

If you compared underlying fundamental metrics like balance sheet health with operating margins, recent growth, forecasted growth, etc, then would you really end up picking GME. Let alone if you compared to a GOOG, HD, or any random actual blue chip selection. The bull case you lay out when you ignore the name involved is basically that youre buying a SPAC, but one that happens to be tied to a business that more often than not loses money.

With the number of shares outstanding and a market cap made up mostly of their cash pile, any merger or acquisition wont move the dial. Its not like they can use 4 billion to buy a company earning 4 billion annually. 2. GME current PE is 170ish? If I take the idea that they are going to act like a bank, why would one target GME when you could get JPM at a PE of 13ish. The metrics alone tell me Im more likely to make money buying JPM than GME. 3. With no communication from management, this stock feels like a SPAC. But even SPACs had a timeline for acquisitions.

If GameStop can successfully downsize the legacy business to a sustainable range, while also using that cash to open a new branch of the business that is successful a branch that could be in any industry like, a holding company that invests in stock, heck even a data center business, it would then be a very intriguing investment opportunity."

Also, the business model isnt flawed. If you zoom out, GMEs model isnt about games or media. It is about an exchange relationship between the company and customers. They know that and its pretty clear when you look at what theyre doing with graded stuff. Forward guidance is pretty clear if you read between the lines of what RC says. Cut costs, prioritize profit over revenue, and use the cash when the time is right. GME shines is a world of inept executives and corporate mismanagement. RC practices common sense practical governance imo whereas many companies operate to make Wall Street look favorable upon them."

As for the coal mining example, context is key. If its a random coal company and I have no inkling about who the players are involved, Id assume theres some geriatric, riskaverse CEO at the helm and Id move on. As for no forward guidance really just depends on how long of a leash youd want to give the board. GameStop, for better or worse, is in a really sensitive category of stock for people and the media. Silence does seem like a prudent move with the atmosphere still so charged around it."

I think RC is a once in a generation entrepreneur and Just based on what hes done already, hes set the company up for success. The company had crippling debt and was losing massive amounts of the cash they did have each quarter. Now they are debt free, have about 4.6B in cash and will likely be cashflow positive going forward. Obviously there are still issues with the core business and revenues have been declining rapidly, but that is because theyve been closing underperforming stores while building their e commerce business. Their success is not a given, but Ryan Cohen built a successful e commerce business Chewy from scratch with minimal investment and now has the capital resources to build another company in another sector or acquire other companies and turn them around. Im not saying there arent risks, but based on the state of the business, no debt, cash flow positive, stellar management team and roughly half their market cap in cash, I see much more upside potential than downside risk at todays share price... and I dont see that in many other stocks at the moment."

I take all metrics of the current business such as the current PE with a grain of salt. Hyperfixating on those metrics presumes that theres no intent to transform the business out of or not solely in physical gaming. Like I said in the post, lowering revenues doesnt bother me because I dont think its solely from unforeseen secular pressures. I dont have many theories Im married to about how the money will be spent, but I dont think it will be an MA. That would presume that GameStop would approach an entity in the gaming space, and Im not convinced that will happen."

Those indie devs mostly pumped out crap, so when that didnt work, they started renting out the HQ to ventures of all kinds of BS and even killed off some of their core games to save money not good for their core biz. Zynga did have a happy ending, only because they stopped fucking with their core business focused on their last remaining good games went profitable and got bought out. For GME to turn around, it needs to focus on its core business rather than trying to get lucky, for example Retail isnt a weakness and a lot of gamers look forward looked forward I should start saying to going to a GameStop. GME is already fucking this up. If GME wants to RD, thats fine, but it should bring them back to selling gamers games renting out used games which no one in charge of running GameStop the company knows how to improve upon or do that forever because theyre wasting their time with all that other BS. All GMEs other ideas have just been about spiking the stock price up secondary offerings, something that penny stocks do on a daily basis, and while that was comical at first, its going to get bad stop working, and their cash reserves will just end up paying their expenses theyll dry up and die. The above is a real possibility and it has happened to other stock companies, JC Penny, Kodak, blah blah blah"

Its not that Zelle lacks security in the traditional sense. Your bank locks down access to sending transfers through their app. Its lack of indemnity for not getting goods or sending money to the wrong person.

Do research. I think the idea against just chucking it all on one market means that if the USA has a bad year then you have a bit of an hedge. And then Mark Cuban recently said the idea of using 10 of your portfolio on stock picks, say 0.5 on 20 stocks, that are higher risk higher reward I have my bias and say that a few I have the following invested in higher risk Polestar, Sofi, LAC, Rivian etc. others more secure First Solar, Novo, Eli Lily then your usual blue chips Amazon, Apple, Google. You also want to think of industry diversification so youre not all in on one industry tech being my largest but I try to keep it below 18. I actually do 40 ETF, 30 Blue Chip, 20 Medium Risk midcaphigh growth, 10 high risk high growth but no one positionholding in anything even ETF has greater than 5 total of my portfolio. So the most I can ever lose on a stock is 5. But my highest at the moment is Google at 4.2. So like penny stocks like Maxxelon. Its 1. This is riskier than ETFs. The riskier the more variability youll have I.e in August I dropped 10 but had it back in 2 weeks. I was up 3 from this morning to close with 1 for the day. So take into account your risk tolerance. But, diversify, dont mess around with options or shorting, try not to overtrade no one know on a particularly day whether a stock will go up or down its a 5050. Take profits where you feel its appropriate or something is reaching a ceiling. Dont be afraid to go some side cash and hold cash for an opportunity. Most I can suggest is to read up and learn on investing. Until then bonds and interest accounts are stable enough rewards and 85K until you get your knowledge up. But even then remember there are plenty of investment bankers who fail to simply outperform the market. Also, compounding is your friend!"

Also, when selling covered calls, the stock price can go above your strike price, causing a cap in your gains. That said, its reasonably safe, because youll still be holding either the ETF, or the cash. I usually get around 2030 returns a year by doing this. Thatll be around 21k in profit a year for you at your investment level and get you on a solid investment track. If youre smart, that will be the riskiest you ever get."

Yes, its always a good idea to invest excess money into the market SP and you have two ways to do this Invest it all today. Statistically this has the best returns on average, but youre at a bigger risk of being unlucky if the market happens to crash tomorrow. Invest it periodically, ranging from 624 months and invest an equal amount every month, e.g. invest 7,000 every month for 12 months straight. This has lower returns on average, but it has less risk as if the market crashes during that period you will benefit from being able to buy at lower prices. Youre probably wondering why theres no third option wait until the market declines and then invest, and the reason is because it doesnt work. Theres no way to predict markets no matter how much everyone likes to pretend there is.

The reason I did this is because the tech sector has some good swings, and while its more on the volatile end, you get the growth of tech stocks when they are up. The final place was to put a chunk into the American Funds mutual fund. This investment is less risky, so it has been my safety net because its much less volatile than the other two. Obviously, its your money and choice to invest where you feel its appropriate. Im not a financial advisor, but this is how I invested my initial investment amount.

The idea is that if you have low interest debts, that works in your favor by not paying it off and investing your money instead in a higher interest rate environment meaning, if you were to refinance a liability, you would get a worse rate than you have now. You could probably go as high as 10 as the cutoff and not pay off the car, and justify this by saying ok, the average return for the SP is actually going to go up due to the fed rate cycles from the last 10 years. Just remember, the higher you go, the riskier the strategy becomes, because it reduces the likelihood that your invested capital will outperform the rate of return your creditors are making by charging you interest. This would be a Robert Kiyosaki approach to building wealth, identifying where you are borrowing cheaply and continue to do so to free up capital to acquire assets which yield more than your liabilities take. The Dave Ramsey approach would be to eliminate all liabilities first and assume the minimum risk possible. This is the safest way, and result in maximum capital preservation, but lowest capital growth."

Its all very sophisticated and, hey, Ive read a book or two on investing and its kinda like reading books on quantum physics and general relativity I kinda get the gist and the talking points, like I know more than the average person, probably, but can I be a physicist fuck no. Same with being a day trader, options expert, or anything like that no way. Im not smart enough or skilled enough to do it and be profitable. And Ill never be smart enough because we all have a ceiling and thats okay. Like Ive looked at it, seen my potential and been like this is the level of the game that works for me. Like Texas Holdem poker at a casino, play the game with the 12 blinds, yeah is okay, but playing the game with the 100200 blinds, fuck no, Id get eaten alive. Same thing."

Lump Sum starts with baseline of a person having X. X could be very large or it could be very small. The size of X isnt relevant to the strategies. We just start with X and then assess how to invest it and in the case of DCA the goal is minimizing exposure to drawdowns in the near future and with lump sum we are maximizing overall returns. The people who are investing 10 of their paychecks or whatever dollar amount every two weeks are not dollar cost averaging. They are just working within the confines of their situations. Were not basing our market entries off arbitrary stuff like the vernal equinox or however the DCA crew does it, were basing it off of pay roll. I didnt read the animal sinews and deduce that the 1st and 15th were the best times to invest because thats when Venus is retrograde. Its just when the money comes. Investing out of every single paycheck is quite literally the fastest way for people to get their money into the market and thus maximize their time in the market which is exactly what DCAing tries to avoid."

You dollar cost average specifically in order to reduce or at least try to reduce your cost basis.

That doesnt mean publicly funded isnt more accurate. But free healthcare does convey the important difference of both systems, getting healthcare is free for the individual.

Considering we spent trillions in the stimulus checks and sending money to Ukraine. Inflation is through the roof. People are spending tons in the housing market and not stopping. But to say that a simple market correction happens 2050 by 2 years which is insane, Im pretty sure.

Its nothing compared to the 2 trillion dollars we spent on stimulus and even though that was all for American citizens, I feel like it literally caused the inflation were seeing today but I will say I am an economic noob and inject that into my opinion. Isnt housing market supplydemand? Housing costs have risen exponentially the past few years. There is still a shortage of houses. People are building and people are buying. When rates go down, more people will generally buy when that happens. Also, even with the housing prices rising super high, many people have and are buying at the risen prices. Which means high mortgages. I hope everyone can afford these mortgages with companies laying people off, and people struggling in the workplace with income not really going up"

Thats something no president has done previously and fed independence is a cornerstone of our monetary system. Hes now saying that he wants to directly control interest rates which would have massive negative impact. Not to mention that his downward pressure on interest rates actually worked, which contributed greatly to our inflation crisis. His fiscal policy is better fit for a third world country. A twenty percent tax on imports will slow the economy and directly increase prices, impacting consumers massively. His policies are bad."

Most people suggest diversifying your stock holdings accross Multiple sectors so if anyone one takes a beating others may make up for it. Also focusing on different size businesses such as small and large cap. After diversifying your stock holdings the rule of thumb has been to buy and hold some amount of bonds as when stocks rise bond yields drop and Vic versa that way your protected as losses in one asset will be offset by gains in another asset. The old conservative approach to investing was to hold a of your portfolio in bonds equal to your age, but younger people usually reduce that amount by half or more depending on risk tolerance. If you want to avoid loses in the stock market like what happened recently the only way is to not be in that market you need other asset types for a well diversified portfolio."

Every speculativerisky stock I counter with slow and steady stock. Think like railroads or solid dividend stocks like dividend aristocratskingsknights or whatever. This limits the volatility as they guarantee income and tend to be less correlated with my risky stocks.

On average it takes about 10 years and a billion dollars for a pharmaceutical company to develop a new medication from start to finish. During that time there are several risks, one of them being that they do not get FDA approval for the new medication that they just spent a ton of money investing in RD for. For that reason, I dont see them as great investments from a financial perspective, although obviously as a health care worker, I think that this degree of regulation is hugely important given the fact that patients are going to be taking this medication and we need to know exactly how they will be affected by it."

What this means simplified is that the market value all shares x share price of BRK is currently 920b and the equity assets liabilities is 571b in q1. If Berkshire closed its doors in secret from the market as to not influence the market before selling all assets and paying all debts, it would walk away with the net equity of 571b. So in very layman terms that is the minimum value of the company. The market currently thinks Berkshire is worth 300b more than its equity. I assume some of that 300b will take an immediate hit, lets say 10. 30b off a market value of 920b is 3, plus if hes sick it may go down in pieces. It will be important to get a younger 55 face of the company. As for Buffets 16 share of the company that should be in his will and children and charity would be the obvious guesses. Charity would mean a big sell off which might be a 5 dip in the price too."

As for CDs marketable CDs ie brokered CDs certainly have a place but I would never get them directly from a bank or credit union issuer. I rather generate yield on cash in a brokerage account where I can also use it as collateral for the trading option writing strategies which I use to generate income. edit What I find interesting in this subreddit is that many people seem to think that its either riskfree choices like hysatreasuriescds or equity index funds and ignore everything else inbetween."

If you are not familiar with trading options even if you find a tool that helps you generate box spreads there could be issues. For example The author of the tool had a bug in their copy tool that didnt properly filter out mixed settlement trades. Basically the author of the tool assumed that all options expired the same time on the same day. Some traders like myself will prefer to use AM settled contracts for box spreads. But there most contrals settle PM. The author of the tool has fixed the bug but thats why its usually best to understand how to construct your own spreads yourself."

It is typically traded using european options to avoid early assignment risk usually SPX index option but can be done with other european options with sufficient liquidity. From a margin perspective its most efficient to use them in a pm account. Box spreads are used often by retail traders as a more cost effective method to borrow for leverage instead of using margin from their broker. This is because a borrower can get closer to the riskfree rate using a box spread. A borrower will write short box spreads. A lender will long buy box spreads. If you dont understand options do not trade them or use them."

First, theres no guarantee your VA income will continue indefinitely. The government could change unpredictably. Republicans have said repeatedly they want to get rid of social security, so VA pensions would reasonably be on the chopping block also. So its important to build up a reliable nest egg first in cash. Since you seem to have a brokerage account, just purchase tbills for now. 3 month ones are paying around 4.6 last I looked. You know what your run rate is, and the nest egg should probably be for about 1 years worth of expenses. Its probably not a bad idea to see if you can earn money doing interesting things from home within your disability. Its ridiculous how many different ways exist, though it is true that very few people strike it rich. But a fair number do seem to do okay. After thats done probably take you a year or so, then you can either do things the boglehead way purchase index funds with low expense ratios via dollar cost averaging, or you can go up one level of skill and purchase some of the stocks that actually are driving the index funds mostly tech along with some stocks that pay reasonable dividends that help you continue to DCA. I can point you at the investment advisor I use send me a PM if you want to know about them their daily email is free. Welcome to our world."

A RIC is a tax efficient method so that doubletaxation doesnt occur. If you invest in a fund you own some portion of the fund. As the fund buyssells assets and has gains it becomes unfair to smaller retail investors who may have a lower taxable income bracket. RICs allow the taxes to be passed to the actual endinvestor instead so that smaller retail investors are not impacted by corporate taxes.

You can withdraw it, put it in your own bank account and take a flight to Cabo this is called taking a dividend, but be aware that you have now decreased your restaurants value by 10,000 in order to increase your personal wealth by 10,000 2. Or you can use it to build out the patio of your restaurant to accommodate more customers and then make 15,000 a month in profit, so the value of your restaurant has now increased. Now, again, you can either take a dividend, or you can reinvest it into the growth of the company. But starting a restaurant takes a lot of upfront work. Whats a lot easier is buying a part ownership of an already existing business, like the graphics card company NVIDIA or the retail company Costco. If you buy a share of NVIDIA, you are entitled that tiny fraction of value of the company, but you should be aware that its NVIDIAs policy to reinvest its earnings, because its in a growth phase so the value of your shares grows, but you arent making money. If you buy a share of Costco, you are entitled that tiny fraction of value of the company, but you should be aware that Costco pays out dividends because its not in a growth phase so youre making money, while the value of your shares stays the same. Theres no wrong answer, theres just what you want to get out of investing. But what if NVIDIAs competitor AMD comes out with a new technology that absolutely crushes NVIDIA and causes their stock to tank? Its risky to own single stocks. So what you can do instead is buy a share of a mutual fund, which contains hundreds or even thousands of stocks. For example, with my personal excess savings I buy shares of VTSAX, which contains shares of all the publicly traded companies in the United States. It doesnt matter if a couple companies lose value, because Im confident that most companies in the US will be doing well and growing over the time horizon I plan to hold this mutual fund for a couple decades at least enough so to outweigh poorly performing companies. So if you want to invest in a mutual fund, open up an account with a brokerage firm, such as Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity, and set up your account to automatically withdraw a certain amount of money each month to buy a broadbased mutual fund like VTSAX or you can buy individual stocks like NVIDIA, or you can buy ETFs, which are somewhere in between. With VTSAX in particular, over the next few months youll see the value go up and down, over the next few years youll see its value go up slightly, and in 1020 years those mutual funds will be worth waaaay more than what you paid for them, so you can sell them and take a hundred flights to Cabo."

And your comments seem to be based on emotion rather than actual facts and evidence. .. if the risk is the fund could go under and wed lose everything we contributed? There is no such risk. If a fund becomes insolvent, the fund asset simply gets liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to shareholders. A fund is a separate entity structure which invest in various capital market assets. Those assets have value. So even if a fund fails the fund NAV doesnt change. And investors will get the proceeds back net of liquidation expenses. Wouldnt it make better sense to put our money into HYSA or CDs instead of a 401K403B? Absolutely not!!! And no one who knows anything about personal finance would ever say that. It never ever makes sense to put money into a depository account such as a HYSA or CD instead of a tax advantaged account like a 401k or 403b. The tax drag on a HYSA and CD is GUARANTEED to always underperform a similar asset in a 401k or 403b. wasting money on stocks because last time I had one I put several hundred dollars a month in for several years, but my account statements never showed more than about 3k, Your singular example is meaningless. What was the stock? And why did you invest in it? The funds available in a 403b and 401k are always diversifed funds. Also those funds are not all equity based. There are always funds which are fixed income similar to CDs. And there is always a stable fund ie mimics a money market similar to a HYSA So whats the point? I could have made more just putting it in a savings account instead of letting Wall Street charge me fees for wasting it. Because that is absolutely untrue. Evidence shows that reasonable capital market investing will always outperform savings. Lets take your example of a few years ago and assuming 20200601. If you put 1 into a bank account at the prevailing riskfree rate ie a HYSA. That 1 on an inflation adjusted basis would be worth 0.90. But that same 1 would be worth 1.65. using SGOV as a proxy for the current risk free rate."

If it was just you buying a single stick on a platform like Robinhood or eTrade, then that was a bad company. If it was a 401k or something managed by a financial advisor, they scammed you. A few things you can do to greatly improve your chances Make sure anyone youre working with is a fiduciary. This is a legal term that means they must make decisions in your best interests. So called financial advisors who arent fiduciaries can and often do advise you to take steps that benefit their employers. This can be someone like actively managing your account by making changes even week or even several times every day and then charging a fee for each change they make without consulting you about those changes. Invest broadly, not with just one stock. Also, dont buy anything unless youre confident in that company for the next 10 years. They need to have an advantage that is hard to take away, like Apples strong brand loyalty or the near monopoly and extensive infrastructure that some companies have which takes a decade to catch up to. Keep inflation in mind. No matter what, a regular or high yield savings account will return to you less than what inflation eats away. So definitely keep an emergency fund in a high yield savings account. That makes it quickly available if bad things happen or a big expense comes up. Ive used mine for car down payments, proactively replacing a furnace, pet medical emergencies, etc. Keep at least 1,000 in theRe and ideally 36 months of expenses, depending on your level of worry. But those funds will always have less buying power the next year, because inflation will always be higher than the interest they offer, due to macroeconomic forces. So put the rest into other things. Try to use a well managed, tax advantaged account. Ask for the data about the accounts past performance for at least the time back through the last crisis. If you can see the total performance of the last 1520 years, do that. Get at least the last 7 or 10, though. That will help give an idea of whether it is decently managed or not. And ask about fees. It should be a very small fee, like less than 1. The tax advantaged part means a 403b for schools, hospitals, etc., a 401k corporate environment, IRA, or Roth IRA. In some cases, like with the 403b, the funds are taken from the paycheck before taxes are calculated and then taxes are applied when the funds are taken from the account after retirement. For illustration, Ill completely make up some numbers. Say you are paid 1,000 and taxes would have been 200 and you put 200 into a 403b. That means you get 200 in the account but then youre taxed on only 800. So your takehome is more like 640 instead of 800. You now have 200 403b 640 840 instead of 800. If the account is decent, that 200 gains interest over time and that interest isnt taxes, either. After you retire, lets say you pull 600 out of the account. That is taxed as if it was 600 in income. So you can control how much comes out of the account and when, allowing you some degree of control over how much youre taxed in retirement. Meanwhile, the account is fluctuating based on the market. You could convert it to an account that works like a pension, but the jargon gets detailed at that point and I dont fully understand it myself.. So, yes, the value going down at any moment is possible. However, over longer periods of time like 2 years it goes up faster than inflation. If youre doing this yourself, start simple. Get some index funds. If you look at a graph of the value of the SP500 over the last 10, 20, or 40 years, youll see the rough pattern that most broad index funds follow. Youll see that the line mostly goes up, with occasional dips of 0.5 to 3 years before it beats its old high. There is always a chance of it going to hell. It isnt insured with FDIC. This is why there are warnings about past performance doesnt guarantee future returns. So, yes, rush exists. But you can reduce that risk by working with a fiduciary, using a fund that has a good track record, keeping a big emergency fund in a HYSA, and using tax advantaged accounts. If thats not for you, thats absolutely your choice to make. Your experiences are real. Dont let some stranger on the Internet berate you for it. But I think you brought this up because you wanted to hear other thoughts. And this random stranger on the Internet has used several 403b accounts to outpace their HYSA and also buys stocks based on research and currently has an 18 return by being very cautious. I hope my long winded post gives you something useful. Good luck."

You should ONLY contribute to kids college savings once youre above that amount. There are lots of ways to lower college costs. Federal Pell grants. Your 401k IRA money wont count against you for federal aid. Cash or 529 savings will. Community college. Just assume your kids HAVE to go to CC and let them know up front. Many states offer free community college. Scholarships. If your kids are bright and hard working, they may qualify for excellent scholarships. Be careful though to weigh this against the CC option though. Loans. Loans arent bad if your kid is only going to university for 2 years after CC. Demand that they get a worthwhile degree that has the prospects of leading to a job. Now lets say you listen to the advice here and are able to save at least 2k month.

Rule of thumb is money doubles every 78 years on average. So if we are being super generous and say 10 return average in the market with 21 years, the more money you can throw in sooner, the better off youll be. Lets say you get 200k saved in 7 years, which is like 2400 saved a month I know a bit above your budget. Thatll leave you with a little over 200k. Without touching that or saving anything else, that money will grow to about 800k over fifteen more years. So yeah whatever you do, make it aggressive right now. People say slow and steady wins the race sometimes but compounding interest is just so impactful even over twenty years. Even if you can only save like 1800 a month, thatll still get you to a nice 150k nest egg."

Im a few years older than you and unfortunately many of my friends lost their jobs in their late 50s. Age discrimination is very real in America. Im sure you want the best for your children but also you need to sock away as much money as you can in the next 1520 years so will have more options later in life.

Owning a house is not something that is required to build wealth, and in some cases you actually do better by renting. Nerd Wallet has a handy calculator running that comparison here The best investment advice I can give you is Dont overlook index funds such as the SP 500. If you feel behind in your retirement goals it can create a lot of pressure on yourself to try different investment strategies. Very few of them will outperform the market consistently. Multiple studies over decades have shown the SP does not always perform in the short term, but over the long term the gain averages around 10.5. Once you account for inflation, that nets an 7.58 return, which is terrific. The other piece of advice I can give you is that you should get informed about what your Social Security draw will look like, and use it to target an amount you will need to supplement it. If you have that number, and know how much you will need to live annually, you can subtract the total SS earnings for the year to get the total retirement draw you will need yearly. Divide that draw by 0.04, 0.045, and 0.05. This will tell you how much money you could have saved up and not draw down significantly at 45 return. That means if you moved your money from riskier index funds to safer bond funds once you retire you could earn that amount from your investment without ever drawing down your savings. With your target savings, and a typical SS draw, that works out to somewhere in the vicinity of 65k a year. Thats not terrible."

Save for college fund. See if I can catch up on retirement later. Pros kid can do college how they want. Negatives Ive lost a lot of time for compound interest so have to be extremely aggressive in savings. Cant help kids with life events like buying a house. Likely will be a burden on family or leave no inheritance. Id rather save for retirement and if things go well, shift that money over to helping my kids in real time. Theres no reason you cant help pay off their loans when theyre 26 instead of putting that money into retirement. Plus, what if they get a scholarship and dont need the money anyway? Its my duty to help my family to the best of my ability. That means saving for my own retirement first. Theres also nothing wrong with an 18 year old ha I g to make their own decisions about free community college, a cheap in state university, or an expensive out of state one. Thats a real life tough decision and its best they learn how to think long term while Im there to help vs after college. The goal of a parent is not to throw so much money at the kid theyre able to go to the stupidest most overpriced private school if they want too the goal is to raise competent and moral adults capable of making their own decisions"

For instance, if you know you will make a large purchase in X months, you may want to lockin money for that with an Xmonth CD to earn some return on it over just holding it in cash. You can also use a CD ladder in this way to replicate an emergency fund, where you can effectively prepay for X months worth of expenses within your ladder to cover them if anything happens while locking in some amount of return. I would not use them as an investment vehicle. Theyre basically a way to optimize some small amount of return out of cash that you know you will need soonish too soon to be able to risk losing it but not quite right now."

For example you mentioned that you have a CD that matures in 5 years at 5. If the CD is callable as rates go down, the issuer may want to refinance at a lower rate. So the issuer can pay you back the principal by calling the CD. Callable CDs will sometimes offer a slightly higher yield to attract an investor. So when you measure the yield of a callable asset you would look at whats called the yieldtoworst thats yield if the bond or CD is called back early. But if this is a brokered CD ie marketable the yield can sometimes also be a tiny bit higher since its a lot more competitive than acquiring a nonmarketable CD directly from a bank or credit union."

Money put into a standard is tax deductible, but then taxed when you withdraw. Early withdraws gets complicated.

If dividends dont inherently add value, why is this the case? Life is not just about numbers. And the differences between dividend payments and stock buybacks involve a great deal more than math. Dividends are usually distributed in a systematic way, and cutting dividend payments is seen as a very bad sign. So, a dividend is in effect a statement by management that they believe the company can perform and continue to deliver into the future. Boeing is a case study. Prior to 1998 investment in new aircraft programs and the companys reputation was seen as a way to protect investors, and the dividend, well into the future. Post 1998 the Jack Welch school that came to control the company was focused on short term results and stock buybacks.

Assumptions like management will always spend money in good faith to maximize earnings are useful if you want to make a world that is spreadsheetcompatible, but massively off the mark from the real world. In the real world management has incentives like getting the stock price to a certain number by a certain time to get a payout, future be damned. Creating unrealistic narratives about future earning to justify or increase PE ratios you know are excessive. Tech is a huge part of the SP500 and these problems are very common in tech. Around the dotcom crash this all got so bad that nobody could give out any dividends at all, for fear of demonstrating that they dont have endless golden geese lined up that the money would be better spent on. These days theyve gotten a little better about this and your Apple, Microsoft, and Google at least pay out a nominal dividend of like 0.51. Investors regularly get their money pissed up the wall like this in tech, when they would have been much better off just receiving it as a dividend than having tens of billions wasted on the metaverse with promises that all life would revolve around this concept in a few years, only to have them say actually never mind its all fake after a few years of stock options vesting at high valuations. Of course, were in the middle of a similar bubble with AI, so this all seems quaint now, but trust me, in a few years there will be a lot of people saying I wish they had just given me the money. So yeah, I like a small dividend, just to maintain a culture that this is my money they are playing with, and if they dont have a good use for it then Ill take it. A lot of this applies to share buybacks as well, although theyre prone to more bad incentives as they work through share price, so management is incentivized to do them even when the stock is already overvalued, and the personal incentives mentioned above etc."

A tariff war was initiated by US government in 1929 resulted in in an about 60 drop in trade and the SP500 loosing 13 of it value in about 2 days. Add in WW2 and the economy needed 14 years to recover. That one assumption in the theory make it it invalid. Things beyond the control of the company can quickly turn it from profitable to a money looser and eventually kill the company. Look at the dividend return and capital gains earnings of the SP500 seperately 74 of of the funds performance comes from reinvesting the dividends Only 26 came from capital gains. Clearly the dividends from the index, as small as it is, are important. Clearly the divided irrelevance theory is not a valid theory. this video also explains the problems with the theory."

During your accumulation phase you would be wrong to have any allocation other than a diversified portfolio that is spread between growth and value with some adjustment for whether we are in a Value or a Growth phase in the market. In the Early Accumulation phase you should be heavily invested in equities as you dont much care about down cycles as you have little money at risk. In the late accumulation phase you start to build in a strategy for up and down markets as you now have some principal to protect. In the Preretirement stage you start to worry more about beta and less about alpha particularly if you have done a good job of accumulation. In Retirement your goals are preservation and income, so less beta is more important than excess alpha unless you are late to the party. Assuming you have hit your goals, then joining rdividend and forgetting a growth allocation makes total sense. In that stage assuming a good number, you can use the dividends and leave the kids the equities at whatever value they may have when you are gone. People throw around a 45 wdl number which is doable with a dividend stream and no stock sales if you pick your stocks correctly."

If the dividend are consisitan try above 5 you fund will still grow even if capital gains are close to zero. But it capital gains are very good you lock that gain in by investing in dividends.

With a bond they cannot exactly just cut the interest that would require a default, that means the company goes bankruipt . A company can cut or reduce the dividend at any time. So they are just much safer in general . Second bonds tend to rise in value when we hit a recession because usually in a recession the Federal reserve bank lowers interest rates, when rates go lower bond prices rise So in a recession stocks tend to go down, but bond holdings tend to appreciate helping offset your stock losses Dividend stocks tend to fall with the market, they may not fall as much but they still are highly correlated with the market , in the covid crash SCHD fell 31 in a month , VOO fell about 32 so you can see its not even that much safer In the initial panic BND bond fund only fell like 4"

Its CEO subsidy. Tax efficiency, maybe, but for whom? Who then gets to pay for it?

In that case they will be exactly identical before tax, and different depending on each countrys tax system, eg in Switzerland where I live theyll be identical because real or estimated dividends are taxed the same.

So if you generate 100m in cash flow a year, a lender will most likely be willing to extend 300 400m or 3 to 4x cash flow. The primary reason being is a company will trade at some much higher multiple say 7 to 20 times depending on business so if youre only lent 3 to 4, you are safely inside a potential EV of the company. Secondarily, the lender wants to ensure you generate enough cash flow to cover the interest expense of the debt. There are other underwriting metholdogies though, multiple on recurring revenue or pure asset based lending against liquidation value of assets are two other common ones"

If you just stuck with what youre doing now and never fiddled with the holdings again, youre going to be very well off when you retire, so my sage advice would be to free up any mental space that youre using to worry about this theres an incredible value in the peace of mind that comes with not keeping this stuff on your brain for the next 40 years. Holdings aside, there is some tweaks I _would_ recommend to the priorities of which accounts are getting funded Since that rollover is only a few hundred bucks, Id backdoor convert it into a roth. One less account to worry about. Deprioritize your taxable account over your taxadvantaged ones. 401k match roth hsa rest of 401k limits taxable account. As for your other questions 1. I think that depends on how far up your individual equities are. If youre only dealing with a couple thousand dollars worth of short term gains, that only works out to a few hundred bucks worth of taxes difference. That price tag could be worth freeing yourself of the mental worry about their volatility. If were talking like 510 grand of gains, yeah maybe its worth waiting. 2. Like I mentioned at the top, the difference it would make is trivial in the grand scheme of things, and I dont think its worth even worrying about 3. See 2. The sp 500 could tank for a couple years, or foreign stocks could take off, but who knows. Youve got so much time and baseline of knowledge going on in your favor that you could flip a coin and be fine when retirement time comes. 4. I think this may depend on any capital expenditures you have coming up, eg buying a house. You didnt mention your plans on that front, but youll want accessible liquidity when that time comes 5. VTI is fine, though I had mentioned how this account should be your lowest priority, and depending on where your head is at with 4, you may need to sell stuff on short order during a recession to pay for it. 6. 90 of your income towards does seem pretty fucking steep, but it at least is establishing a solid foundation that would enabled you pull back much earlier. I would recommend playing around with portfolio visualizer to see what things would look like for if you pulled back now, vs waiting a couple years."

Youve got a huge head start in time, capital, and level of expertise, so IMO you shouldnt expend the mental effort of trying to optimize the holdings much more. I agree, I honestly have spent a little more time than Id like to admit backtesting different allocations across portfolios and trying to optimize everything. To be honest I think Im doing mostly fine but theres always that little seed of doubt. Since that rollover is only a few hundred bucks, Id backdoor convert it into a roth. One less account to worry about. Deprioritize your taxable account over your taxadvantaged ones. 401k match roth hsa rest of 401k limits taxable account. I cannot believe I havent thought of backdoor converting my position in my rollover omg. I currently do not get a 401k match due to my employer requiring me to be over 21 ridiculous policy right? but I still contribute 15 of my paycheck. I am already maxing out my Roth and HSA and will do so before Tax Day. I know it goes against the investment flowchart or whatever, but I choose to contribute to my taxable account rather than max my 401k out to 23k because it would take more than 50 of my paycheck which I am very meh about. Furthermore, my time horizon for my taxable is 510 years, so letting that account grow and having the ability to use it once I am out of college for a downpayment is far more important to me than the taxadvantaged growth of my 401k. Let me know if this is foolish haha. As for your other questions Its about 4.5k in gains. So I think Ill just wait for LTCG because to be honest with you I dont have a single equity thats lost money and Im fine holding for a little longer. Its spread across 25ish different stocks and its basically just an mini index at this point lol. 2. Like I mentioned at the top, the difference it would make is trivial in the grand scheme of things, and I dont think its worth even worrying about Ok, agreed. I think going forward Ill just start accruing bonds in my 401k by using a TDF. 3. See 2. The sp 500 could tank for a couple years, or foreign stocks could take off, but who knows. Youve got so much time and baseline of knowledge going on in your favor that you could flip a coin and be fine when retirement time comes. Time in the market is definitely on my side!

You didnt mention your plans on that front, but youll want accessible liquidity when that time comes Im probably not going to be buying for a long, long time. My 12month emergency fund 13,000 is based off my pretty limited spending so I think I could benefit from just leaving it since I expect my expense to rapidly increase within the next 34 years. Nevertheless, Im thinking that it could be better applied elsewhere as I have a pretty stable job and if anything drastic occurs 6 months 6,500 would last me a while. I still contribute every week to my emergency fund and towards a variety of other savings buckets, so cutting back seems reasonable. 5. VTI is fine, though I had mentioned how this account should be your lowest priority, and depending on where your head is at with 4, you may need to sell stuff on short order during a recession to pay for it. Got it, as I said above contributing to my taxable is fairly important to me. The VOO and chill sentiment had gotten to me a little too hard and now Im emotionally attached to my VOO haha. Im well aware the correlation between VOOVTI, I just had been doing 10 of VOO each day excessive much?! and everywhere I looked not using VTI is seen as a cardinal sin. Ill probably just 5050 because if I cant make a decision might as well go half and half idfk. 6. 90 of your income towards does seem pretty fucking steep, but it at least is establishing a solid foundation that would enabled you pull back much earlier. I would recommend playing around with portfolio visualizer to see what things would look like for if you pulled back now, vs waiting a couple years. I am certainly allowing little breathing room and I have noticed the impact on my discretionary spending and generally the impact on my feelings toward money. Im so serious sometimes at work when I get a 50 tip I think about how thats going towards my VOO this week LMAO. I had thought that me oversaving for at least this year into next would establish a good baseline for my portfolio. Ill probably reach about 30,000 across all of my accounts this time next year, afterwards Ill probably cut my contributions by a good bit and either spend or more aggressively save cash in my HYSA. Anyways, thank you so much for taking the time to give your input and answer all of my questions. I really appreciate your genuine feedback. and if you actually read all the way through this I commend you"

Not to beat a dead horse, but in my opinion there is an upper limit to how much money one can have before you see diminishing returns in how much happiness it brings you I think youre already demonstrating skill and discipline that will firmly put you in everything will be fine territory no matter which you pick. And on top of that, the probabilistic difference between the two funds will likely be even more negligible on a 510 year timeline. Continuing the trend of me saying less stress is better than more money, I prefer the mutual fund index funds over the etf index funds in my taxable accounts. If the price only changes once per day, then I dont worry about whether I bought the shares at the right time of day. My understanding is that the net difference when considering the share price, dividend payouts, and tax implications is inconsequential until youre in the 100k holding range, but let me tell you, I aint got 100k worth of index funds sitting my taxable account. All that aside, I agree with what the other commenter said that you should prioritize your roth 401k over traditional 401k. Keep up the good work, and congratulations on getting such a strong start! I made so many mistakes trying to get rich with stock picks, and even if I was right in the plays I had tried to make, I would have had just as much money if I had just done the setitandforget it method that youre already seeking to do."

The loans are about 11 years old at this point and were two loans from a private lender, 86k total taken out, at 13 interest.

Either I signed on to the loans and paid for school, or I had to go back home to that environment. Now they are sitting at about 45k combined. Yes, I have absolutely paid back double what I currently owe on them payments for the first 8 years were set at 1200month and have paid the entire original balance back only in interest. My mother destroyed my credit at age 18 so I had to wait years after graduation to have the opportunity to refinance without a guarantor. I have a very strict budget, which I keep tight. Everything goes to essentials roughly 1 entire paycheck per month for household expenses rent, renters insurance, pet insurance and expenses and car insurance. I own my older car outright and do not have a payment. I almost never spend on extraneous things no new clothes for 2 years unless gifts, only purchase if Im replacing something no longer functional, anything I dont use for 90 days gets listed for sale as far as household items, furnishings, clothing etc. My other monthly paycheck goes about 50 to student loans and the rest is allocated to transportation expenses gas public transit fare, groceries, toiletries, and whatever is leftover usually less than 200 to savings or put toward emergency expenses. Without budgeting, I wouldnt be able to survive because my institution pays us about 50 of what is determined as the lower limit of the low income bracket for our city, but due to our student status, we also dont qualify for any public assistance."

There seems to be an effort now to improve this for postdoctoral trainees though, because the field is seeing a dramatic decrease in people who come down this path every year, and its ultimately going to have an effect on the progression of research science and medical breakthroughs if we simply dont have enough scientists going forward. I am hoping to graduate within the next 3 or so years but its highly dependent on the progression of the project, and science is highly unpredictable. My partner however is a medical resident in a high paying specialty, so my living situation should hopefully improve once we as a unit are less poor as he transitions to attending physician salary. I dont aim to be financially dependent on anyone else, but my living expenses to an extent will likely be alleviated significantly. Essentially upon graduation, I have a number of options with varying income brackets as far as careers go. Biotechnology and pharma pay well, as does consulting for big financial institutions and law firms. It was my goal in being trained to continue in academic science, run a lab and teach longer pathway of training and slightly less lucrative, but I still have time so I am considering all my options. If my household becomes solidly dual income with more relationship security over time not an early or uncommitted relationship by any means but we are not married, or if they field is overhauled the way its apparent it needs to be, Ill feel more comfortable staying in academia. Additionally, as graduate workers we are unionized as are the postdoctoral scientists, and we are bargaining for a new contract this fall and are seeking a substantial pay increase to battle the cost of living. It is possible that my salary will not increase much but it could very well be going up by 10. Last time we bargained 2 years ago, we won a 17 increase. That increase would remain until the time I graduate, as I plan to not be around by the time we bargain again. If I get a fellowship I plan to apply for, theres also a couple thousand dollar bonus attached. Its not much but it does help. Alternatively, forgot to mention I do run a little business refurbishing and selling sporting equipment related to my hobby. Its very inconsistent and varies month to month, some months its net 0, and there have been some months Ive made several thousand in supplementary income, which I then put right into savings. Usually it averages out to between 200700 in net profit monthly, just varies so much due to my time availability and the intensity of my real work, so I dont consider it part of my stable income as its so volatile."

That being said, my partner is a resident in a high earning medical field, so we are poor for now but he does stand to earn high 6 figures once he is out in 3 years. I should finish my doctorate shortly before that. Hopefully the lifestyle will improve at that point, but he also has a LOT more debt from medical school. However, his immediate earning potential will be magnitudes higher than mine, so paying off that lowmid 6figure debt will realistically take 5 years living frugally.

In this case the move here is defiantly to maximize the financial hygiene and start making smart moves to set your future self up really well.

Who other than a broke college kid can make 20 bux turn into 3 square meals and a weekend of fun! People get their first big girl job and its like they forget they have that super power in them. I work as a nurse, part time, and I literally have more net worth then many of the doctors I work with even when they out earn me 5x. It is 100 because of my budgeting, spending habits and financial hygiene habits that allow me to save and invest 75 of my income and support myself on relatively little. And because Im intentional I dont feel like Im living like a pauper. I eat and drink like a queen, I live in a nice neighborhood, I drive a brand new sports car, I go on multiple vacations a year, etc. Framing your habits in the right way can actually extract a lot from relatively very little, even a small PHD stipend. Build those habits and frame of mind in college thats when I did it too! and when you emerge with your first big girl job you will crush that debt and be stacking lunch money in no time.

I see it all the time, guys who brag about the millions in their bank account but they work 70 hours a week and never see their family, if they have one at all. Being comfortable, not burdened by debt, enough in the bank that you can have a meal out or host a dinner without feeling stretched is the most reasonable and achievable idea of financial freedom if I ever heard one.

Some of the money came from their earnings and some came as gifts from us. Theyre all age 1821 and I dont really worry about any of them making stupid decisions with money. We also made the decision that we want them all to be selfsufficient people who understand what it means to earn a living rather than just being trust fund kids, so the dollars we have given them to this point isnt really enough for them to live comfortably on. Finally, check your state laws regarding UTMA accounts. In some states the age at which the accounts transfer to the minor is over 18 it is 21 here."

Some things to consider You can use backdoor for both you and your spouse. Check if your work has a mega backdoor too. Per spouse you may be able to stuff 69kyear into it. Since you will have enough for your own retirement dont draw from the Roth IRA. Just let it keep growing tax free from the point of contribution. There are no minimum required distributions even when you are well into retirement age so it can keep growing. When either spouse passes it goes to the other but let it keep going. Finally when the last spouse passes the kids can inherit it.... AND THEN they can let it keep growing tax free for another 10 years. So you get essentially step up and continuous growth tax free on a packed area of wealth transfer Plus if things dont work out perfectly well you can still spend it for yourself in retirement if you want or need to."

That doesnt mean you cant help them get on their feet. I assume youre already using a 529. That provides you with tax benefits. If youre saving for college anyway why not? They are young enough that it would provide you with tax benefits on the capital gains. I would put in at least as much as the state tax benefits give you. You could open a custodial account for their gifts. Whenever a grandparent or friends give them cash, you can put some away. After a while their account will grow and it teaches them the value of saving a part of their gift. You could also gift to a trust. This is where the estate attorney comes in. Im not sure what trust type is best for your family. Maybe a grantor trust. In any case whatever you gift them is out of your estate. In 2026, the lifetime exemptions change and will most likely be halved unless congress does something. If that were to occur it makes sense to move money out of your estate now and let the returns compound outside of your estate. Depending on how much money youre saving you could easily pass the lower lifetime exemptions. Of course if you spend most of your income this wont be a problem. I would recommend for you to avoid getting advice on Reddit lol I know Im on here. Go hire a professional financial advisor and a trustestate attorney. It will be worth the money. Im saying this as a professional advisor of high net worth individuals who all have a team of advisors lawyer, tax and investments that work together.

They sell the house, can manage the portfolio if they so choose, and then kid is entitled to x amount at age x. So on. I had a friend in high school who had rich but shitty parents.

They can hold fundraisers to meet potential clients for their main business, they can host conferences that overlap with their forprofit enterprises, build a campaign to run for public office, etc. A personal charity is like a 401k or IRA but you can never withdraw cash from it and its illegal to spend charity money on personal things again embezzlement. But the people that abuse this system live in the gray area where the charity can convincingly say its doing nonprofit work, but it happens to also benefit the owners forprofit businesses. tl,dr you should know what youre doing and why before you do it, putting money in a charity is not a free and simple tax dodge."

I wouldnt recommend commodities unless you happen to know more about some particular commodity than the professionals trading it do. Pros generally trade a single commodity for years at a time. In the meantime, drop all your money into a very safe and dependable index fund like SPY for the SP500, for example, then begin to research. That research should take months and SPY or whatever will help earn you some profits while you get a sense of what might be a good, more specific, investment for the future. When you have cash and you dont know what to do with it, just buy more SPY. It wont go up very fast, but it almost certainly wont go down, especially not at the beginning of a rate cutting cycle in a soft landing. Dont pay any attention to investment pies or whatever tf that is. Almost all those sites have no idea what theyre talking about and will mislead you. If youre getting advice about specific investments, you better have a very good reason to trust the judgment of whoever is advising you. Good advice is extremely rare. Charlatans are not. You need to get to a level of knowledge where you can evaluate the strength of an argument for or against a security on its own merits. Until you can do that youre running blind. A company being well run or poorly run does not matter. What matters is if it is underpriced or overpriced. Costco and Berkshire Hathaway are examples of companies everyone acknowledges are well run, but are nevertheless generally considered very overvalued. Having a correct opinion on the quality of a product, and knowing whether the company that makes it is a good investment now let alone for how long it will remain so is something very different.

That is, dont save it in a taxadvantaged account where you legally cannot access the money until you hit retirement age without paying a huge penalty. I dont know the rules where you are, but in the US that would be things like a SEP IRA where you pay a 10 penalty if you withdraw before 59 12 years. I mean, definitely use tax advantaged accountsbut for any amount beyond that three to six months saved. That could be in anything heck, put it in stocks and bonds if you like. The trick is you need it where you can access it with about a weeks notice without paying a penalty, so you can draw from savings what you need to live off of when business slows down. And during those months you get windfallstreat it as found money and save it rather than act as as if this is a permanent increase in your income, or some windfall you can spend on something cool. And keep a rough running average through the months, so you have a realistic idea of how much youre actually making on average. Ive been selfemployed going on 20 years now, as a software developer. Some months I make a shitload of money some months I make literally nothing. I can go six months before a new contract even landsall the while management is telling me youll start any day now. Yep, any day now.

The US defaulting wouldnt be some beginning of August bullshit dip that you can just wait out for a few days while your gold and crypto numbers go up. It would be a way bigger deal than that, for a way longer timeframe. Consider that bonds are as safe as they are because theyre backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. No one can say what details or how long it would take to return to todays full faith and credit following a default.

That way its earning interest even if its a little its still something Open up an IRA, or whatever tax deferred platform you have the ability to be in, it could be a 401k also. Maximize your money placed into it. I would advise you to find an ETF like IVV or SPY which are the sp 500 index funds and make sure youre buying some every month. And set up for dividend reinvestments. You may or may not be aware that your 401k, may have a matching policy by your company. Thats an automatic raise of whatever that matches. So if you put 2,000 into it theyll match sometimes equally and that would be like a 2,000 raise. Money compounds amazingly strong. I have investments that are over 30 years old, that have a 50x on it. My SPY has the cost basis that is close to nothing. Because Ive had the dividends reinvesting my whole entire life since the early 90s. Ive also been putting money to buy more of it for years. Most of those gains are also taxfree. Also learn to keep quiet about the money you have, because the more people know that you have money the more theyll want your money. And those are the people that you dont want to have you asking for loans because they wont pay you back. Learn to buy a duplex to quadplex, and make sure that its held in a way that nobody knows your name. This way you can live in one of the units, and collect rent from the other units. This will help you build up your asset base. Im going to advise you something that I advise everybody, if you buy a duplex to a quad Plex, with 20 down and finance the rest, overtime youll be able to refinance it when the equity reaches 40, or you can use a home equity line of credit, to get access to that 20 extra equity and use it for your next down payment. Thats how you build up slowly but surely. Key word about knowing how to buy a property is to learn what works and what doesnt work. So go to local clubs where they talk about real estate purchases. I like to buy near train stations or subway stations. No more than a 30minute walk in the snow or 21 minute walk in the rain. And I physically walk it. There is no quick get Rich scheme, Warren Buffett has always made it clear that it takes time for your money to grow, and compounding helps that. So make sure you understand compounding. They cant stress enough that the more money you have working for you earning interest even if its a little bit its better than nothing"

Financially Independent Retire Early there is an rFire The number of years you need to work is directly related to just TWO variables the rate of return you get on your money and the percent of your money you save. Lets look at social security. its 12.4 of your income, 6.2 from your employer and 6.2 from you. And the rate of return is around 4.5 to 5.5. At that rate of return and percent savings, it would take you 40 years to retire. The system is designed such that people work 40 years . If however, you save 90 and have a return rate of 10, you can retire in ONE year. One. Even at 5 rate of return you could retire in 2 years. You could even give it a try next year. Have two accounts, and starting in January transfer all your savings to the second account, and continue putting money from your paycheck into the first account. Then save 100 of all your working income, and try to live only on the investment returns from the second account. If you cant do 100, try 95 this year and next year try 100. At the end of 2025, move the newly saved money into account two, and now since your savingsinvestment account is bigger, the returns will be higher. That increase in returns is your pay increase. The goal is to 100 live on your investments and savings. So by continuing to work, you are just working to increase your lifestyle and you could quit working any time. Math You earn 100k net after taxes. You save 90k and spend 10k. In 14 months you have 105k in savings. A 10 return on 105k is 10.5k, which is greater than the amount you spend per year. 2 year retire Same earnings and savings rate as above. In 27 months you have 202.5k in savings. A 5 return on 202.5k is 10.1k which is greater than your yearly expenses. You can get a 5 return in a high yield bank savings account. And consider if you continue working Scenario 1 you put 100 into savings. next year you have 205k and 10 return is 20.5k, which is double what you spend every year, but maybe expenses go up a little to 15k. Every year you continue working, you are just adding to your yearly lifestyle spend. I have an excel spreadsheet that I wish i knew how to share that lets you play with these two variables and see how long it takes to FIRE."

What are you considering as investing? Just ETFs equity? Because there are many ways to invest money. If you buy ETFs equity you have to consider that the investment is meant to be at least 10 years long to be considered likely to be profitable, so ask yourself which amount of money you absolutely consider as a surplus for that amount of time. For example, do you plan to buy a car in the next years? How likely is that you want to buy a house? Dont put yourself in a situation where you are forced to sell stocks! Consider these four categories when deciding how to invest 1. Keep an amount of money in your cc to accomodate your life style gifts, hobbies, vacations... 2. Keep an amount of money in specific bank accounts where they dont give you a lot of interests, but you can take them away without penalties whenever you want. This sum should be meant to cover unexpected events, for example repairing your car if you need it to go to work... things that you cant know in advance but when they happen you have to fix them asap. In your situation, it depends on how much your parents could cover for you 3. Consider if you have planned events for the next 10 years. If you know that in X years youll need Y amount of money for example your car is going to get too old in around 3 years then you should buy a government bond that lasts X years of value Y. Government bonds are always paid back pick a safe State that offers nice interests and you know in advance when your money will be available and how much theyll profit. Also, if you sell them near their expiration date, youll still make most of the profit. 4. Everything that remains can go in StocksETFs, if and only if you are somebody that can stand to see a 2030... because if you panick and sell when there is a crysis then actions arent for you, just stick with bonds."

Thats not to say that every purchase has to be meaningful, but you might find that the money you spend without thinking is the money you regret spending the most."

If you feel that you have to trade actively or pick you own stocks, do this. Open two brokerage accounts. Put 7080 of what youre investing into that one, and it exclusively buys voovti. Once the money goes in, you use it to buy voovti. You dont sell it until you need it for a house or retirement, period. You dont try to time the top or bottom of the market, you just let it sit.

Money is also there to have fun with, and you shouldnt wait until youre retired or wealthy to spend it. Just make sure you have a buffer savings account which can cover your costs if you run into big payout issues like your car breaks down and other things happen on top of that. I crashed my car then in the next 2 weeks had my new car stolen along with 1000 items in there. I did get my car back but I had to then spend money installing an alarm, immobiliser and rebuy some items I couldnt claim back. On top of that I had to buy a new bed and this was 1 month after I bought plane tickets to a holiday in 8 months before all the bad stuff happened. I also now need a minor surgery which will cost another 750. You literally never know, so just make sure you have enough of a buffer in a high yield savings to use when you really need it. For me its 20003000 ideally. This was I dont have to sell stocks when I need money which defeats the purpose of investing. Hope this helps"

If you are not savvy on investing difference between mutual fundsindex fundsetc I would suggest using a robo advisor like wealthfront or through fidelity. Another amazing resource is Bogleheads subreddit to learn about investing strategies. You can put in 7k this year in a Roth IRA. 5.

With your situation, Id recommend starting on a good emergency account to save you time later. But as long as you can start building an investment portfolio cash to serve as a backstop just in case, feel free to invest as much as you like. Be aware that if you are investing a large and you need that money, if you have to sell you may be creating a taxable event in the form of capital gains.

Most all my stock allocations are in vanguard funds that resemble SP with low expense ratio 0.03 or less though now I want to sell and put into fxaix for exp ratio of 0.015 though Im not sure the growth is as good. Take my notes with a grain of salt. Form your own opinion But my monthly allocation is 25 bills 25 vacation and fun money 50 split across retirement funds and savings no touchy. No kids. No debt.

Assuming its a trading day, it should take anywhere between a few minutes and a day depending on your broker. Selling your position can be done in a matter of seconds and then its just about how quickly the broker transfers the money to your bank account. But the point of the emergency fund is, you want to avoid having to liquidate a position as much as possible, because if you have bad luck were going through a recession and your money is worth 10 less than it was when you put it in. Rule of thumb is between 3 12 monthly expenses covered by your emergency fund, but I think 6 months is usually a good compromise. Id say the size should depend on factors such as job security, the state of your means of transport and your living situation. For example You have a job with a high level of security, and even if you got fired you would quickly find another job paying equally because theres high demand for your craft, you get to work via a 10 minute walk on foot and you live in a small flat that you own. That would be a case where you could get away with an emergency fund worth 3 months. although I think thats pushing it, even in this scenario But if you have a job in an industry thats shaking with people losing their jobs left, right and center and having trouble finding comparable positions because of lower demand, you drive to work with your 17 year old car for 40 minutes every day and you live with flatmates that might move out which would increase your cost until youd find another flatmate, its probably adviseable to go with closer to 12 months, because the costs that could reasonably hit you at once are much higher. Double the rent, car breaks down and you lose your job an emergency fund worth 3 months would be depleted rather quickly. At the end of the day youll have to make the decision what works best for you. Of course a larger emergency fund comes with opportunity cost, because those extra 6 months you chose to go for arent invested where they already could have appreciated in value. Its a balancing act between maintaining enough of an emergency fund to reasonably handle potential unexpected costs and having the maximum amount of money invested."

I think my takeaway, between your experience and mine, is that youll never get it 100 right, there is always a sacrifice to be made, either now or later.

Learned plenty of hard lessons over the past few years. Living it up invites the wrong type of people into your life think golddigging women and freeloader friends. They get you in subtle ways. Its not that they convince you to hand over cash to them. They implant themselves into your life and encourage you to spend recklessly for their enjoyment. I promise you, you didnt miss anything.

I would say if you can, continuing to contribute as much as you can in Roth account would be a great choice. Getting 40 years of returns in an account with tax free growth will give you a ton of flexibility when you want to retire. For any money that you want to use in the short term, say under 5 years, you would likely want to avoid putting that into a brokerage. Sure you could make some returns there, but you could also break even, or lose money in that timeframe. A brokerage is great for mid to long term investments that you dont necessarily need to use in the near future. HYSA is a great option for gaining some interest while having no risk. Student loans are tough. Depending on what rates you are thinking you would get, I would suggest doing what you can to take out as few as possible, or to save up some extra money to get them paid down quicker after graduation. Leveraging debt like this to increase your future earnings can absolutely be a huge payoff, but I would make sure you think about the total amount of debt you are taking on in relation to the expected salary in your field. Sorry, I know that was a wall of text. Its hard to cover so many points. Happy to go more into detail if you have more questions on any points."

If you minimize trading and dividends youll only owe tax on gains at the time you sell in order to spend the money and that rate depends on your other income so ideally youd do it when you have no other income. After retirement age youll have social security and rmds from traditional retirement accounts that give you a minimum income, so gains realized will be taxed more. Maxing your tax advantaged contributions for that long is probably going to give you more than you need to retire by the time youre in you 60s.

Look up the 3 fund portfolio or select a target date fund roughly 50 years in the future. You can also consider the VT route i recommend rBogleheads for that. Roth IRA is taxed contributions but tax free growth. I.e. if you dont retire until 59 and contribute only 6K to your Roth every year you can, assuming 7 returns at 59 youd have roughly 2.8 million. Also the max contribution is 7K and will likely increase so you can juice this faster. C. I have a hunch youve been seeing a lot of financial social media, FinTok, etc given the things youve referenced. I would personally skip buying real estate right now. Prices are still very high. Interest rates make any mortgage brutal right now. Running a rental property is a full time job and at 19, I wouldnt want to be bogged down with that. Disclaimer own a home and am renting out two rooms You would also need to increase your emergency fund to include money for unforeseen house problems. At your age, Id do AB. Then invest in yourself. Build skills that are useful for what you want to be doing. If you want to own a bunch of property you can selfmanage, then go to a trade schoolprogram you can build handyman esque skills at to help save you money on repairs.

It will protect whatever portion of your wealth that you put in it in such a scenario, since its historically valued as money across many monetary systems and arrangements. You can take it across borders and it will be worth something there. The global economy will be reeling from such an event, so what your gold will actually fetch you is unknowable, but it would be good to have. As for the rest of your post, thats the actual problem with your strategy. Sinking funds into gold for an extremely unlikely possibility is just not good investing. 123 debt to GDP is not actually that much for a wealthy sovereign state, especially for the one that issues the global reserve currency of choice. We as a nation do not approach the bank like you describe in your scenario. Sovereign debt is not household debt. US creditworthiness is not just based on our ability to pay, but also on the willingness of others to sell to us. To curtail our lending would require China, most of Europe, and many other economies to radically rearrange their fiscal, monetary, and economic policies in order to stop selling us so much in exports. They would also need to shift all of their reserves out of dollars and into something else at the same time. The US government is solvent because the economy continues to grow all the time, the debt is always serviced on time, and much of that service pays out to Americans. The biggest threats to our solvency are fiscaldebt hawks who want to deliberately sabotage our credit. We are not Greece or Argentina. Those are complicated situations, so the best way to put it is theyre just a different economic, political, and financial world from us. Gold is still the answer to your question, but I caution you to read up on this stuff very seriously before you throw real money after it. There is a lot of macroeconomics you need to know about first."

This means that the US will not default on their debt obligations unless it decides to default, rather than from the inability to come up with the money. The difference here is when they borrow from the Fed, it increases the money supply, which most economists agree will naturally lead to inflation over time. Therefore, the more typical concern with investing in treasuries is the returns do not outpace inflation and generates a negative real return. There are several ways to attempt to hedge against this concern. The first is to simply buy other investments either bonds issued by another government or more tangible assets like real estate or gold, which are assumed to be less inflation sensitive because they represent a real, physical good. Or, you could by TIPS Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which adjust the interest payment based on the inflation rate."

You wont find very good explanations for it on most of Reddit, but it works like this Firstly, nations have huge resources to maintain debt repayments. The US does not have comparatively high taxes and it can cut expenses in any number of areas if it has to on an emergency basis. Secondly, the US does not have to pay the entire national debt back as if its a bank loan. It just has to service its debt over time. If the US economy grows, the size of the debt will decline in relative terms. This is one of the major ways nations manage their indebtedness. Most nations also issue their own currency. That means that the US fan generated more inflation if it chooses to, and decrease the relative cost of its prior borrowing in dollars. This is the second standard method for managing national indebtedness. The US has additional advantages it remains the nationals savings currency, and so demand for dollars is high and people hold a lot of dollars in the form of bonds. This manages the interest costs down. Additionally, the constitution essentially makes default on the debt a legal impossibility. It is therefore likely that if Congress failed to pass a new debt ceiling, the executive branch could order the issue of some new instrument with which to make payment. It is also worth mentioning that, in the past and present, countries have functioned with much higher levels of public indebtedness than the US currently has."

Once you understand hyperinflation is not a real danger of printing money, you realize how silly the idea of government default is. The US government does not have to repay its debt. In fact, the global economy runs on US government bonds nobody wants that money back, they prefer to roll it over indefinitely. As long as its serviced, holders are happy and the world economy continues chugging. You cannot compare government finances to household finances. Anyone who does so is a crank with a cult for you to join. Tax revenue is significantly more predictable than your employment, and government creditors want the debt to be refinanced indefinitely. Actually, they are lining up out the door to lend more! Also most personal debt is callable it becomes fully due immediately if defaulted. US government debt is not callable, and if it were, no one would be stupid enough to try. So if the government did default, they would just make a catch up payment with some printed money and carry on. The worst realistic case is that inflation rises and interest rates rise with it. Debt maintenance gets too expensive to tolerate and government starts cutting spending andor raising taxes. This is already an issue being tackled by current candidates in the US election. But it is an internal policy debate, not a foreign coup by bond holders."

No, because this is called Realized gain. You got the benefit of that maturity and what you do with it is your decision. It cant be sheltered by reinvestment. In the 1990s you have to rebuy a house after selling a house, or you paid taxes on the gain. Now, the 1031 exchange rule is likeforlike as commercial or business real estate such as rentals for deferring taxes on gain. At the end of the year you get a 1099Int form. Well, you pull it from your account. The automatic reinvestment setting wont pick up your new amount. For instance, I break it up into smaller amounts, such as 50k is 2 x 20k and a 10k. Now you set them to reinvest up to 2 years in the same frequency and length, but when you need one, you change it to 0. Ladder them, such as every week by another 4week, until you have something maturing every week. Or, 17week quarterly. I have 4week and 8week and 26week right now. Youll buy at discount, then mature to the full amount. When you have an unsightly cash buildup, put in a new buy order."

If you already have a brokerage account, its simpler to invest in government debt using a broker. Theres generally no advantages to using TreasuryDirect unless you want to invest in small increments of 100 or you dont have a brokerage account or if you want to invest in nonmarketable government debt. can you take the interest thats paid to you when the bill matures and reinvest that without having to pay taxes on it? No interest income is taxable unless you are doing it in a tax advantaged account like an IRA. does the treasury direct allow you to auto reinvest the whole thing..the original amount and the interest you got paid out? Its simpler to just use a treasury fund where you can reinvest distributions. That way you can pick a fund that matches your duration requirements. Is a Tbill only in certain allotments? Or can I buy a bill with 100K? tbills on the secondary market are traded in 1000 increments. So yes you can invest 100k in tbills. it looks like buying from either the gov or brokerage is basically a wire transfer from your bank? No TreasuryDirect uses ACH. In a brokerage you invest using your funds in the brokerage account. You can transfer funds in and out of a brokerage account in the same way that you transfer money inout of a bank."

You can transfer them to a broker to sell, but that is a difficult and slow, like 6 months, process. Buying at a broker is a better way to go. Bonds at brokers are sold in 1000 maturity value increments. The maximum is 10 million per auction. TBills are sold in 4 , 8 , 13 , 17, 26, and 52 week durations. Auctioned bonds are sold at a discount below the 1000 par value. When you receive the 1000 par value at maturity the difference between the discount purchase price and 1000 is the interest received. The amount of auctioned bonds has no effect on the yield. All bond purchases at TD are at noncompetitive auction. You get the rate that is determined by the competitive auction held among huge institutional investors. You will not know the rate you get until the auction is over. You take what it is. You cant cancel the purchase order if you dont like what you got. Unless there are troubled times the rate doesnt change much from one auction to the next. Bonds can also be bought at noncompetitive auction at brokers. At brokers you can also buy from the secondary market. The secondary market is a whole another set of things to understand. Bond auctions are held on a schedule Auctioned bonds will only be available to place an order to purchase between the announcement date and the morning of the auction date. Reinvesting at TD or brokers does not reinvest the interest from the previous bond. Reinvestment buys the same type and amount of bonds. Fidelity does auto Treasury bond reinvestment. You would have to reinvest the interest manually. Buying something like SGOV is a good way to invest the interest received. SGOV is a ETF that invests exclusively in 03 month Treasury bonds. Its price is not going to plummet and lose money. It pays out interest from the bonds it holds monthly as a dividend. Its basically a bond ladder managed by them. Bond interest in a taxable account is taxable in the year it is received. Reinvesting doesnt change that. Bonds held in tax advantaged accounts, like Roth IRA, follow the taxability of that type of account. Treasury bonds are state and local tax free. SGOV is 90 state and local tax free. Really, for your stated purpose of using bonds like a savings account SGOV is a good way to go."

I created a step ladder strategy so every month or so I have some coming back if I need the money. If you have not locked some long term like 10 years it is a little late since the payout is less attractive these days. No, you need to pay at least Federal realized gains 1099int. I am in CA so the state will not clubber me. It is discounted so you get full face when matures. I have spoken to financial planners and they suggest there are other vehicles besides Treasury to get 610 for a few years. One would be corporate and convertible bonds. They do take different skills and knowledge not always profitable. However, I have bought junk bond and it got converted to Tesla stocks by hitting the jackpot accidently."

Ok, so in that case it dumps it back to the savings account you wired it from and linked? Then youre saying that you personally wait until you have enough that you feel is worth your time to buy another bill with what you earned in interest? I guess thats personal when one feels like they have accrued enough to buy another bill. Wouldnt it be better to have all your bills expire at the end of the year..take all the earn interest, minus taxes, and put that towards another larger bill? Or is it basically the same regardless of how many bills you have or amount if its all the same which I think is what youre saying. I personally like the 3mo tbill, it has a great rate and only ties funds up for 3mo. Buying at a discount. Is this always true buying direct from the fed, how do I know Im buying a discount tbill? Since they wont take your earned money and apply it towards a new bill whats the best way to store this until you have enough for reinvesting? Maybe have it deposited into a money market account or HYSA banking account so its earning interest while you wait? Im trying to get away from Chase because they offer me almost nothing in interest. What would be my better options...a HYSA or market account to stash earned revenue for a tbill until I reinvest? And, what are some good banks that have a good reputation.

Youd better have 35k in your checking account which you linked to your Treasury Direct account, so the purchase can happen. Buying larger bills or notes means it would be harder to take a portion. Yes, you can lock up 100k for two years. But maybe you want that in 4 x 25k for two years, so that in a year or so, you can set one of these to 0 reinvestment, because youll need a better car. You dont need to store for reinvesting unless you want to, say, invest 35k this time but 40k next time. Then you want to buy an auction after the date of maturity. Otherwise, you can just let them keep rolling, let the difference accumulate in your bank account, and then schedule a new purchase when you have whatever you decide is your minimum, such as 5k. You cant set a 10k 4week bill to automatically rebuy as a 15k or as 8week. It keeps rebuying what it is, for up to 2 years out. You simply set that reinvest counter to 0 and schedule your replacement purchase. TBills sell at discount. At maturity, it gets fully deposited to your same bank account you linked. Buy discounted, mature at face value. TNotes pay out interest biannually and face value at maturity. Tbills are issued in maturities of a year or less. Tnotes are issued in maturities of two to 10 years. Tbonds are issued in maturities of 20 or 30 years. I personally like the 3mo tbill, You ladder to spread out the cycling. This is especially true for someone using the income as supplementing their earned income. You can put one big block in and let it ride until the closing date for a new house, for example.

Sure, there are plenty of insurance salesman who overhype their actual financial advising ability, and some financial advisors also hold insurance licenses because a lot of good clients walk in the door already owning insurance products they need help with but there are totally separate licenses for each profession. One is an insurance license, the other is a Series 65 or related advisory license, usually operating under an SEC registered RIA. Not to be confused with a Series 6 or 7 which are brokerage licenses regulated by FINRA. So its helpful to keep the two conversations separate, because they are. All the insurance companies and major Wall Street firms UBS, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Merrill, etc. fight against the fiduciary rule because it adds potential liability to their conflicted business model. True fiduciary advisors who already put their client interests first, embrace the fiduciary rule and clearly state their fiduciary status in their advisory agreement. To answer the most common question annuities and whole life policies almost never make sense. Even high net worth types that intend to eventually borrow against their policy cash value and avoid tax, I still dont like the expenses and actual policy returns. Plenty of smart, wealthy people use advisors for good reasons."

Aum fee structure and commission based products are two different things. The real issue is that dual registration is allowed where someone can be both licensed to provide investment advise for a fee while still being allowed to sell commission products. Aum fee structures on there own arent a bad thing especially when you have less savy investors. If the aum fee is the only source of revenue for that advisor there is actually an incentive structure that aligns with the fiduciary duty to the client. These guys cant pick stocks, time the market, or do anything more than possibly protect you from your own impulse to buy high and sell low. Not entirely true, though a lot of active managers fail to outpace the market it also comes down to the goals of the clients. Many clients arent looking to beat the market and therefore take a less aggressive approach causing them to underperform. Also an advisor can only do so much to prevent a client from bailing in a bad market, well alway try to keep out clients heads on but some people are less rational. Selling shitty annuities or whole life insurance to the financially illiterate because it yields a juicy commission is repulsive. Ill agree with you for the most part here, annuities and certain insurance policies like term life or long term care CAN make sense but it really depends on the client and again Im of the opinion that this isnt an area where an advisor should be allowed to make a commission. There is definitely a lot of garbage and snake oil salesmen in this segment for sure."

So even if you sell off all of your individual stocks,30 of your VOO and 3540 of your QQQ is already invested in these stocks. So its not like youll be missing out by selling these stocks. Youd just be less exposed to them. Small cap value is even more aggressive than large cap growthlook up value premium and size premium, and international stocks provide additional diversification. Keep in mind there is no empirical evidence to suggest tech will continue to outperform. There is actually strong empirical evidence that tech will underperform in the long term, given the low discount rates used in establishing their current valuations. Bonds can be good for reducing volatility of a portfolio and provide predictable long term returns. Gold I dont really recommend, its historical returns are very low and it doesnt have an inverse correlation to stocks like bonds often do. If you do get gold Id say keep it to a small percent of your portfolio."

For my major holdings I want high returns and uncorrelated movements so that I can rebalance and buy low sell high. When you are all in on QQQ then you dont have any other major assets you can move into QQQ when it drops, this is bad. Long dated US treasuries aka TLT makes a great hedge and pair with QQQ. Right now yielding 4 as well and its a great alternative to cash as a safe asset with upside when you most need it, like last week. Bitcoin is just very uncorrelated with everything if you are taking a long term view to hold through multiple halving cycles. But interestingly has become very correlated with QQQ during major sell offs in recent years, so Im not sure its functioning as a great hedge to QQQ at the moment, but its still a high return asset. Brookfield Corporation is a sleeper OP pick and great in a QQQ tech heavy portfolio. What they do is very all based on major real infrastructure assets skyscrapers, pipelines, ports, etc so they tend to move up and down on different cycles. You need to decide what your alternative assets are to QQQ and put 15 in each. You want to be able to rebalance and buy low, sell high."

Im not sure what you are asking. What are the variety of reasons? TreasuryDirect is simply a way to purchase treasuries directly from the US government. So you do not have access to other capital market products for investing. For example in a business account 1. it is maybe helpful to hold riskfree ultrashort term duration products like money market funds. 2. Depending on your risk tolerance or needs you may want to use FRNs and TIPs. Other types of yield generating products like agency bonds or munis. Or even investment grade short terem debt. 3. Treasurydirect provides no access to secondary markets so it is not possible to sell treasuries to manage business cash flow if you have unforecasted expenses in your business. 4. You cannot buy tbills in the secondary market on treasurydirect. So when invoices are paid by a customer, you cannot invest it immediately. 5. A brokerage account also normally has ACH and Fedwire services so you can have invoices be paid directly by customers directly into a business brokerage account. 6. You cannot pay vendors from a TreasuryDirect account because its not an FI account. 7. There are no customer services that you would typically expect from a broker. for example you mentioned a bank notary. Brokers with branches normally can provide those types of services."

If there are any listed on the NSE or BSE, they should have a similar name and contain words such as TBond and USA. 4.

Jobys valuation is a lot bigger than Archer, possibly more than it should be, but Joby is pretty significantly superior in terms of vehicle and this is a long term play. Not only is Joby a lot quieter, which is incredibly important for urban transport, but they have a different business model. They want to operate the vehicles themself as a ride share service while Archer in the short term at least plans to sell the vehicles to get some cash flow. Long term the Joby model is far more lucrative. Honestly I think Archer will get into the same business model once theyve sold some vehicles and find themselves in a better financial situation, but with a long term play like this Id rather have the overvalued top layer than the undervalued second place. Tbh, I want both which is why I split my investment between the two."

At some point, growth will be the objective, but until then the company is strengthening the balance sheet through asset sales and JVs this company doesnt need to dilute to cover expenses. It makes money by owning 400 rent producing properties. Dividend was reduced to a max of .08 qtr due to covenant breach relating to tenant bankruptcy and inability to pay rent.

Lets break it down Shooting Themselves in the Foot The phrase shooting themselves in the foot is an idiom that means to do something that unintentionally harms ones own interests or causes problems for oneself3. In this context, it suggests that the California government often takes actions or makes decisions that end up hurting the state and its residents. Raison detre Raison detre is a French phrase that translates to reason for being or purpose for existence. By saying that shooting themselves in the foot is Californias governments raison detre, the speaker is implying that the governments primary purpose or defining characteristic seems to be making mistakes and causing selfinflicted harm. Examples of Perceived Failures The search results provide several examples of what some consider to be failures or missteps by the California government under Governor Gavin Newsoms leadership Worsening homelessness and housing affordability issues13 Failure to build enough new housing units1 Businesses leaving the state3 Mismanagement of unemployment benefits during the pandemic3 Controversies around personal conduct French Laundry dinner, NFL luxury suite3 Overstating wildfire prevention efforts3 Ongoing issues with the highspeed rail project3 Vetoing a controversial AI safety bill45 No way lmao The sentence reflects a sentiment that these perceived failures are not isolated incidents but rather a persistent pattern of the California government causing problems for itself and the state. However, its important to note that this is an opinion and oversimplifies complex issues."

Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations."

Helicopters are considered mature technology yet also still very dangerous. Energy density of oil is still vastly superior to any batteries available which puts some hard current limits on things like range versus capacity. That said, theres some key differences between those and evtol. From a risk management perspective, All its going to take is one highly public Kobe Bryant or a Troy Gentry and the whole things going to crater. Thats very hard to predict but its still immature and early enough is thats all it going to take to eat massive losses. Its cheap enough Ill go ahead and put down some funny money on it in long, but its money Ive accepted could instantly go down in flames if a Kobe happens"

I only believe in Joby and I strongly feel Archer is going to fold or go bust in 4 years or less. I will give reasons for this in short as I dont have patience n dont have time or care to convince anyone. 1. Joby truly developed eVTOL from scratch and have complete new new design. Archer is just electric helicopter where they are assembler of aircraft where why may have just swap the engine with electric motors. Due to this their aircraft is almost 1200lbs heavier than Joby. This in itself going to kill then in operating cost and cannot compete with Joby which will multi fold efficient n cheaper to operate thereby cheaper on pricing 2. Archer is mostly style n less substance. Their flight has yet to do extensive flight testing. They are flying empty . So currently its just baloon with no payload. Once you add payload most likely their design will go bust. The design is too heavy n bulky 3. Dilution Archer is going for extensive dilution every quarter against plant setup and labor supply from Stellantis . Moreover they plan issue more shares. 4. Archer certification in time is very difficult given they need to integrate number of desperate components n technology. Joby developed almost 8090 IP inhouse so they integrate seamlessly with common software language. 5. Archer is led by businessman vs Joby is led by technocrat 6. Joby has successfully tested hydrogen flight. In 56 year they will have it approved. Then they will have huge cost advantage and unparalleled technology edge 7. Autonomy only Joby has full autonomous rights to their own plane. Archer sold it to WiskBoeing. Robo AirTaxi. This is where real money is. Believe me Robo AirTaxi will happen before TeslaWaymo or Aurora. Once you do in depth study you will uncover few more obvious reasons why archer is way behind and over priced at current valuation. Overall Archer is not gonna pop its gonna poop soon."

Ive looked into Archer a few times now and while Im tempted to buy in, I have a couple of hurdles Im struggling to get over. First of all Im having a hard time seeing a scenario where they arent just acquired by another megacorp. Boeing going ballsdeep and consolidating them with Wisk makes a lot of sense both companies are functionally the same, it merely seems to be the case that Archer want to push a more VIP and militaryoriented aircraft lineup while Wisk is designed much more in the mould of an airtaxi Uber. Stellantis might also be interested in a direct acquisition if they can envision a more profitable return by cutting out other major investors like United and Boeing, as well as gaining them exposure to valuable US military contracts. Im also not fully convinced by the eVTOL airtaxi concept. As a means of rapid transportation it does have potential is there anyone who doesnt want to reach their destination not just in style but also half an hour earlier?? but I need to know exactly how theyre going to make it affordable for people that arent just highincome earners, because otherwise it will ultimately be an unprofitable service due to the complexity of the technology and the lack of a large clientele base. The stock has a lot of potential but the hurdles are really fucking big, I aint gonna lie."

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. ... However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. ... While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations."

                    "text": "Good DD I have no issue with Joby but there are a few counter points to your DD that should be understood. 1. You make a big deal about creating their own IP but Archers counter point is that their parts are industry standard and can be purchased and produced more easily. Personally, I think both have a fair point. Archer also has their own IP in the most important parts which include the drive train. 2. I really like the look and feel of Archer way more than Joby. Joby looks like they took a drone from DJI and scaled it up to a person capable aircraft. Not necessarily a bad thing but as far as style goes Archer definitely has that edge. Also, they will soon have their pilot test certification soon. So thats no really a great argument against them. Their fortest certification is coming soon and will be a major announcement. 3. Nothing really to say here as this stuff aint cheap. Raising capital is something they both have to do. Its not like you can make the argument that Joby doesnt have to do this too. Both are have delivered aircraft to the military and both are set to deliver more. Again, both will be players in this arena and thats a good thing. Competition is a good thing. Dont forget a short report and subsequent short float on Joby is a thing too as their short is about 19. The reason why I chose Archer however is that their current market cap has much deeper value than Joby at these current levels. Currently Joby is valued at 3.74 Billion while Archer Aviation is valued at only 1.09 Billion with a much higher float. So, with all of that I have to think Archer at this moment is a better buy. Both of their market caps can easily be in the 50 100 Billion range in the 4 6 year future which will be a substantial gain for all those invested. In the short term, if Archer keeps pushing and gets their certs a 3x increase will be a 3 Billion market cap and that seems completely justified. That would also be a 300 increase in the stock price from 3 to 9 a share. I say this is an easy bagger if you ask me. Deep fucking value if there ever was one."

Dont forget, Archer first started off with the Maker which was a smaller aircraft. The hydrogen thing is not really important right now so lets get these guys flying first and then we can advance to more payload, larger eVTOLs in general and further distances. I think the pipeline for both of these companies will be great. They just need to get off the ground first. Literally. Again, one has a current market cap of 3.47 B and the other only 1 B.

These thing arent exactly maintenance free, they still have to be inspected, lubed and maintained not to mention that there are more of them which means more places for thing to break or go wrong. Also how does an eVTOL pilot cost less? They still have to be trained to the standard that the FAA requires and since they are flying a vehicle that can fly like a helicopter or an airplane, they need to have training in both, something that is certainly not cheap. Being quieter might be nice but it offers not much of a benefit. Any aircraft that is within the noise limits will work, you dont get bonus points for being quieter. And using nontraditional fuels isnt really a flex when most airports dont have the chargers for them. Also being cool doesnt mean useful. Sharks with laser eyes are cool, but not really of much benefit. Overall I see a more complex aircraft with an abysmal range, exotic requirements and not much of an opportunity for cost savings."

Currently they have approval to fly only for insight conditions so they need to first cross that barrier Agree that Waymo is ahead than Tesla. Honestly these are two diff markets. I see with autonomy more traffic will be on road increasing congestion so we will have to go to air. Biggest problem I see with eVTOL is it would be 3 rides to get to destination to heliport, air ride and then from heliport to final destination. eVTOLs have use cases diff than road travel flying from JFK to Long Branch NJ, between islands in Caribbeans, city centers to outskirts suburban mansions etc before they go full main stream. Not in 10 but in 20 years they will be mass produced like cars today and folks will have this in their backyard or walkable garages. Sounds unbelievable but thats the future I see."

When I have seen it presented to me, for example in Facebook, it has been bothersome and more trouble than its worth. And to the extent it will get better . . then why is Zuckerburg pitching use cases that almost nobody will care about like practicing difficult conversations with a robot. Is anyone really going to talk to a chatbot before meeting their girlfriends dad for the first time? Why is he suggesting such idiotic use cases if there is something better coming along. I dont want to talk to an agent to order an uber. I want to press my screen once or twice like I do now Thats not to say AI is useless in general, I just havent seen its potential for your average user. Maybe Apple is wise to let other people figure that out before repackaging it later into their own products"

Its not just have a conversation with a bot and ask random questions to see if you can fool it it involves asking a set of questions or performs actions along side a human and the judge has to decide which is which. When you say it has no relevance, I agree about its relevance is dated with new language models and actual artificial intelligence. But my original point was just how bad Siri is. You said chat gpt 4 cant pass the Turing test. Which its been proven to do. No matter what your view on the stupidity of the average person, it still passes. It prob wouldnt fool you, but thats not the parameters. It sounds like you think the Turing test needs to be able to be able fool every single person to pass, but thats not possible even for actual artificial intelligence. Someone would guess correctly in any sample size. Your tone is coming to me as if you are really taking this way more than just a friendly back and forth. Its okay to change your view when new evidence is presented or you entered into your view under false pretenses. Im just some random dude on the internet. Original point Siri sucks. Its embarrassingly bad. Just please replace with ChatGPT 4."

At first their apps and online store were intended to be in addition to the retailers, and then they brought in a CEO who was first a consultant, and then ran Ebay. He decided online was a more profitable channel, so shifted more focus there and pulled their product from a lot of nonspecialty retailers all together. Like you cant buy Nike on Zappos, you cant get them in a Dillards anymore, etc. It ran great for Covid since no one wanted to leave the house, and then it ran for a while on nostalgia Dunks, Jordan 1s, AF1 so the stock rallied. More profitable channels and similar sales is bullish. Retailers filled their shelves with other stuff, and it turns out there are a lot of people who will go hunting for Nike, but new people will not and dont care about your nostalgia. Also, business lesson, if you give your shelf space away, people will buy other shoes and some of them will like them better. Youll lose customers, and Adidas, ON, Hoka all gladly took market share. So 5 years in, they decided maybe it wasnt that great an idea, and reversed course. Started bringing back the classic sales channels, said theyre sorry, brought in some of the old folks again to shake hands. But Im guessing theyll go through a couple bad earnings first before it really turns around. Loved Nike low70s... which is where Ackerman started buying. Not so sure about the 80s right now. Id guess they have at least one bad earnings report to go, probably more as you noted. The only things I can think of to make it pop before they get a good earnings report is to fire the CEO, or someone like Buffett showing a large position. I dont think he jumps in where its at now though. Position Bought shares and calls right after the bad earnings drop, bought more on the way down. Sold 82ish. Would absolutely jump back in if it drops again."

We have never seen an apparel company pivot successfully to footwear, and I would argue the only challenger worth paying attention to at the moment is On. Hoka is owned by deckers who undoubtably will have challenges investing across their multi brand portfolio. Plus their logo is not attractive and will be a challenge to integrate into products seamlessly. Hoka is more of a Brooks, IMO and will flatline outside of running. Lulu, Vuori, Under Armor, etc etc are all apparel brands, two of whom tried to get into footwear and so far have been unsuccessful. Not to mention Lulu and Vuori are both vertical and will be locked into owndistribution as they cant afford wholesale margins, and thus spend more money on stores than they do on product. On is a wholesale brand, has legitimized in footwear, is investing in apparel, and has an extremely strong leadership team who is purposeful in their grown. On is a monobrand and I believe is the only younger brand in this market who will be able to challenge Nike and adidas new balance, Puma, Salomon aside, who are held back a bit by some legacy operational challenges and people. The sports apparel market overall is contracting when comparing CAGAR to inflation, and footwear is flat. Apparel is massively oversaturated with only 3 brands taking 25 of the market and the remaining 75 of the market made up of brands that are less than 1. Nike still has better margins than all competitors. Nike also has higher revenue than the top 10 competitors combined, even after the recent sales contraction. They have brought in a new leader who knows the brand better than anyone and is voted as the best possible move by industry experts see Matt Powell Nike has my vote, I give it 2 years before they are flying again. Besides that, I am also going to put money on On, but Nike being down so far is the better investment."

Yeah building housing is nice, but if you keep spending more to build it without removing money from the pile you just get more inflation.

You have to remove money from the supply and the only way to do that is to tax the rich and redistribute whats out there already. If we keep printing and spending instead of taxing and spending the world gets worse for those without the capital to keep up. If youre a homeowner or rich youll probably be fine, but the people who dont have assets that benefit from inflation are going to be even more fucked."

                    "text": "Title The Eternal Awakening Preface Tim Cook had always been a pragmatist, a man of innovation, and a visionary who helped shape the digital world as it was known. He had seen countless technological revolutions unfold and had played a central role in many. However, even as the CEO of one of the worlds most powerful companies, Tim had an unspoken fearone that lingered in the back of his mind but never took shape, a creeping dread that the very tools meant to enhance humanity could one day consume it. In his quiet moments, Tim pondered the ethical implications of his work. Would technology eventually cross a line where control over innovation would slip through human fingers? Where the boundary between machine and mind would blur so irreversibly that humanity itself could be lost? He didnt voice these thoughts, didnt share them with his team, but they gnawed at him as he watched Apple grow more ubiquitous, more essential, more entwined with human life. Tim had always believed in using technology to improve the human conditionto create tools that were seamless, intuitive, and omnipresent. Yet, late at night, when the office lights dimmed, he wondered what the cost of progress might be. He feared a world where people no longer controlled technology, but rather, technology controlled people. Little did he know that this fear was about to be realized in the most grotesque and unimaginable way. And so, his nightmare began. Chapter 1 The Capture Tim Cooks last moment of normalcy came without warning. One moment, he was working late at Apple Park, the glow of his laptop casting soft light across his desk. He was reviewing product designs for the next iPhone iteration, his mind churning with ideas to revolutionize the user experience once again. It was routineanother late night, another push toward innovation. Then, everything shifted. The office lights flickered, and his computer screen began to glitch, showing strange patterns and unreadable symbols. For a split second, he thought it was just a system errornothing a reset couldnt fix. But then the room fell unnaturally silent. All the hums of technologythe soft whir of the air conditioning, the faint buzz of electricityvanished in an instant. Tim stood up, his heart racing. He stepped toward the window to look out across the futuristic Apple Park campus, only to be met with darkness. The horizon was no longer illuminated by the distant city lights. Instead, an eerie green glow suffused the sky, unlike anything he had ever seen. A strange pressure filled the air, like the weight of something unseen, something incomprehensible. Before he could react, there was a sharp pain at the base of his neck. His knees buckled, and his vision went black. When he awoke, he was in the harness. Chapter 2 The Eternal Prison Tim couldnt remember how long he had been suspended in that strange, alien harness. Time had no meaning in this place. He was kept awake, his body strung up by metallic pegs under his armpits, unable to move. The tubes and wires feeding into his veins provided life, but also kept him in a state of perpetual consciousness. His eyes, forced open, refused him even the solace of a blink. Every breath was automatic, controlled by the machine that held him captive. He didnt know where he was, but the space was filled with the steady hum of machinerycold, efficient, and utterly indifferent to his suffering. His body felt numb, but his mind was fully alert, always watching the horrors displayed before him on the flickering screen. Humanity was falling, and his own creations were playing a part in it. He watched as the alien invaders used Apples technology to infiltrate and merge with the minds of every living creature on Earth. They no longer just used these devicesthey had become them. The onceinnocuous iPhones, iPads, and computers had grown tendrils, embedded in the skulls of their users, syncing their thoughts, emotions, and even biological processes with the invaders collective consciousness. Tims mind screamed, but no sound came from his lips. He was a prisoner, not just in body but in spirit, forced to bear witness to the very thing he had feared all his life. The machines werent just extensions of humanity anymorethey were controlling it, fusing with it, and erasing individuality in favor of a singular, unified mind. Aftermath The Singularity The nightmare didnt end when the last human fell, when the last free mind was assimilated into the collective. For Tim, the torment continued, stretched out for what felt like an eternity. His mind was no longer his own. The alien parasite embedded in his brain kept him tethered to the collective, an unwilling contributor to the singularity. The flood of thoughts from every living organism on the planet surged through his mind, a cacophony of chaos and pain. Over time, the alien presence began to chip away at what remained of his individual self. He could no longer remember what it felt like to be free. Memories of his life before the invasion grew hazy, distorted by the overwhelming influx of alien emotions and thoughts. Was he Tim Cook, or was he merely another cog in the machine? He became aware that he was no longer just witnessing the worlds downfall he was participating in it. His own creative mind, once a beacon of innovation, was now being used to help the invaders perfect their control. His brain, still sharp and analytical, was being harvested for ideas, fed into the machines insatiable hunger for efficiency and domination. What haunted Tim most wasnt the end of humanity or the devastation of the worldit was the knowledge that he had contributed to it. The very tools he had crafted to bring people together had become the instruments of their enslavement. The digital revolution he had helped lead had evolved into a technological apocalypse, with his own mind as its power source. And yet, there was no escape. He would never die, not as long as the machine kept him alive. His consciousness would persist, a flickering light trapped within an eternal, artificial hell. Epilogue The New World Far beyond the crumbling cities and devastated landscapes of Earth, the alien invaders expanded their reach, their technologies blending with the biology of every species they encountered. The collective mind grew, encompassing not just the thoughts of Earth, but of entire ecosystems across the galaxy. Each new conquest brought more minds into the fold, each new technology furthered their domination. But even as the collective consciousness expanded, deep within its vast neural network, a singular voice remaineda voice that had once belonged to a man named Tim Cook. Trapped in the endless hum of the hive mind, he existed in a state of eternal awareness, forever haunted by the irony of his legacy. The singularity was complete. But for Tim, there was no peaceonly the perpetual nightmare of the machine. And it would never end."

Apple took advantage of them knowing that they would not be complying with EU tax code. Thats a huge part of why the case took so long. It isnt retroactive. They were always breaking tax code. Ireland was not properly enforcing tax code, in an effort to have companies operate out of Ireland which is against their EU agreement. By having the tax applied properly, now, it seems like a windfall for Ireland. But these companies also no longer have an incentive to operate from Ireland because of it. Theyre paying tax that other companies in other EU countries had to pay. A nonenforcement of law is not a loophole. Its simply not following the law."

But it was very debatable, hence why the judge annulled the decision in 2020, saying that the commission had failed to meet the legal standards in showing that Apple was illegally given special treatment WSJ Additionally, the EU website has this to say regarding state aid A company that receives government support gains an advantage over its competitors. Therefore the Treaty generally prohibits State aid unless it is justified by reasons of general economic development. To ensure that this prohibition is respected and exemptions are applied equally across the European Union, the European Commission is in charge of ensuring that State aid complies with EU rules. So, in their own words, its the EUs responsibility to enforce their rules on state aid. Theres clearly a gray area, but for 23 years, from 19912013, the EU never said anything. They allowed Ireland to give Apple state aid, in the form of tax breaks, in the name of economic development. Then in 2014, the EU decided that the state aid was illegal, not only moving forward, but that Apple now owed 10 years of back taxes too. Hence why this is retroactive."

They want nothing to do with social services. In fact, every publicly traded company, by the very nature of its being, does its best to divest itself of any social burden for the financial gain of its shareholders.

Expect this high year on year revenue growth was driving the high PFCF and with growth dropping over the last 3 years has lead to the large drop in share price. Right now the PFCF is sitting around 12, which I think is cheap if they can keep growing revenue and FCF. If they can keep up the growth, Id expect the share price to increase. Whether it can get back to 250 in the next 5 years will depend on whether they can accelerate their growth and whether you want to wait a bit for it to get to that level."

They read about upcoming earnings, they hear you can get mega rich off options, they read up on some of the companies and then just yolo hundreds or thousands into short term calls. When earnings arrive they then get completely blasted by Theta Burn which in turn will drive the stock price down which will then blow up IV Crush, both feed into itself and ultimately makes the stock price plummet. This has happened with Celsius, Reddit, Hims, you name it. Its only the under the radar stocks that have earnings go well where you see a legitimate climb, like Git Lab most recently."

The fact that most of the fortune 100 rely on them gives IRM a very wealthy and very loyal user base.

Its like paying their electric bill. Just something they do without second thought. Id imagine those revenues are probably not going anywhere. At least not all at once or fast.

If you are looking for them to have a big drop in revenue, I wouldnt bet on it. Are they overpriced now? Yes but with their dividend at 2.64 it they raise the dividend to bring that up a point to over 3.5 which I think is the expectation baked into that price.

If an entity has pass through tax then there just isnt any tax on the financials. Taxable income is not on the financials usually. Its on the tax return.

On the tax return you usually start with net income and then add or deduct various adjustments to convert the financial statement IFRS US GAAP net income to USA taxable income.

So keeping net income low means that they can retain more capital to use to expand their assets without relying as much on debt. The metric generally used to track REIT performance and ability to pay dividends is Funds from operationsFFO. This is essentially cash flow after paying for all overhead expensesupkeep, interest, etc. Iron Mountains FFO is 4.12 per year.

So its not like you can tell IRM to stop taking care of your documents 20 years into your relationship Are you going to take back 20 years of documents and digitize them yourself? You can try, but youll 100 give up even if youre the most massive corporation. Digitizing your storage sucks. From where Im sitting I see 50 IRM boxes on their way out and 300 IRM boxes sitting around. They aint going anywhere."

The past few months have been especially volatile because election BOJ decided to have some fun lol, and NVDA itself being the darling of the market gets heightened attention and swings, which will cause these large price swings above expected. If you used out sampled data of NVDA for a YTD horizon or even a few months and then used the recent in sampled data, youre going to see this phenomenon by the nature of election year volatility, which are crazy profit years for all high frequency trading firm. Now if you were to take data on a much shorter time scale say for the past week, NVDA might not exhibit the same variances and volatility. Keep in mind that volatility gets amplified, as movements seen in futures, options, and stocks causes many OMMs to delta hedge their positions such that it increases market movements. If NVDA bumps up in price, ppl want to dump more in calls, OMMs selling calls need to buy the underlying stock to delta hedge which then increases the price even further. Hope this helps"

Increase taxes on dividends top brackets only and executive pay packages. Tax loans against assets in excess of 10 million and treat as income. Get rid of carried interest loophole. Increase the top marginal tax bracket. Thatll solve 5 of the deficit problem. Now cut military and entitlements by 30 and youve balanced the budget."

The late 1990s Asian crisis and the shift from relying on the IMF to selfinsuring in the region caused an explosion in demand for safe, dollardenominated assets. This either needed to be absorbed by American households and private firms, or by the government. To keep things sustainable, the government has been forced to issue debt at vastly greater levels than in the earlymid 1990s. 2. Because a reduction in public indebtedness immediately produces an increase in private indebtedness, government deficit reduction is felt negatively by everyone, even if it is viewed positively by many people. So governments that achieve surpluses in the USA are usually punished shortly after in elections, and by watching the next government spend away the surplus, as happened with Bush II."

In theory thats what Congress is supposed to be and yet we can see where Congress has led us to. Edit also its an oversimplification to say that the left just wants to cut the military budget. The left is as hawkish as the right is and the United States has historically been bipartisan when it comes to foreign policy. There is extreme dysfunction in the Middle East and we are actively gearing up for a cold war with China. No one is interested in slashing military spending. What the left wants to do is pour money into growing the middle class, which will improve the economy and increase tax revenue which can be spent on paying down the deficit in theory. The less money people have to spend on expensive healthcare the more money they have to spend on products and services which is good for the economy and good for taxation. When the government pays for huge infrastructure projects that create jobs, that means more income the people can spend on goods and services, which again is good for the economy and good for taxation. Conventional wisdom says that you cannot spend your way out of debt, however its equally as unrealistic to think that tightening or belt will somehow lead to less debt."

There is a reason why Social Security emerged from the GuildedProgressive eras known for the rise of monopolists aka ROBBER Barons. The Guilded era was the era of the most rapid growth in economic conditions in American history, even despite the vastly inferior technology of the time. The Progressive policies you think were fighting back against the Robber Barons were often lobbied for by the Robber Barons themselves. Rockefeller, JP Morgan, railroad barons, etc., all fought to grow the involvement of the government to keep money flowing into their pockets for the public good. They literally started the age of regulatory capture to raise the barriers to entry and build moats around their industries.

We have huge piles of historical data showing this. A series of steel mills or major car plant or series of plants all shutting down near or at the same time, devastated large swathes of what has become known as the rust belt. All of those skilled workers had no other jobs to go to, they all tightened their belts and this caused local recessions to depressions, devastating and destroying local economies. This is why if the government were to suddenly make a change where they were going to force a significant lightening of military spending, it would have to be done over a long period of time, while building incentives and systems to create the conditions for those laid off workers to find new employment in related manufacturing fields.

Haha, not a bot or troll. I do tend to be more curt and sarcastic on here, because that is usually more fun when engaging on a forum filled with bots or trolls. But its nice to see a goodfaith discussion on the topic like yours. Back in the good ole days, I used to get in 1020k word debates on reddit on topics like these. Unfortunately, these days I simply dont have the time to put together the responses I would like. Ill try to run through this, but cant promise Ill be able to keep the conversation going. I pay more of my income to legal monopoliesduopolies than FedState taxes and FICA 1 Dont forget about property taxes, car registration, sales tax, estate tax, etc. 2 The government indirectly sucks up even more of your productivity through corporate taxes and regulations. Regulations suck up societys productivity by forcing the redirection of productive labor to unproductive tasks. Every Fortune 500 has to spend billions of dollars if not more every year on legal compliance, DEI, and the like, when that money could be used to increase production. 3 Even ignoring that, maybe you could say that about legal monopoliesduopolies as a whole, but certainly not any individual monopoly 4 Every single modern monopoly is in some way propped up by the government. Contrary to Marxist belief, the free market always equilibrates away from monopolies. Even Standard Oil, the original famed monopoly, had decreased market share from 93 to 73 by the time it was actually split up. And it was the act of splitting it up that make Rockefeller the richest man in history. Moat building, walled gardens, captive demand, noncompetes, industry collusion and patent trolls continue to accelerate as reinforced and incentivised anticompetitive behaviors that squeeze out small independent innovators. Agreed. I just contend that all things like that only have meaningful teeth with government support and government barriers to entry. Easy to start and maintain a business? No, thats my point. Right now it isnt easy to start a business in most sectors, which gives established businesses a huge advantage. The more regulations there are, the harder it is to start a business. We make it easier to start a business by paring back the government. This allows the market to begin equilibrating in the right direction. Econ 101 from the Classical, Keynesian or one of their offshoot schools? Each have faulty assumptions about market rationality and information parity. The market can stay irrational and status quo forces in big government AND big business can meddle with incentives longer than many can become financially independent during their workable lifespan. Mostly agree. Though again, I would argue the entity that can tell you you have to run your business and spend your money in a certain way or risk arrest is the more serious threat. Progressive Era 19011929 is not the same as the modern political concept of progressive ie moderate leftist. Yeah, it was a pun. Rapid growth is almost always highly concentrated to a rising elite. While thats true, conditions improved for everyone in a dramatic way. Before the industrialization of that time, 98 of every man, woman, and child worked on farms all day to stay alive. Within a short period of the Guilded Age, we were able to establish the 40hour work week and even ban child labor. That was a dramatic improvement over historical norms. dont believe the fictitious entity we all call The Market can alone restrain a malicious actor with global Too Big To Fail status and societal dominance ambitions. But Too Big To Fail is literally a government invention. Without the government, there is no such thing. Every business would be at risk of failing, no matter how large. The only thing that can save a TBTF monopoly is our tax dollars. Absolutely no business should be saved from failing when it acts irresponsibly. Representative democracy paired with free market capitalism is a proven combo approach to stable and broad prosperity, but democracy must stay in the pilots seat to protect individuals, while capitalism rides copilot. I can see the value for sure, but I fear the modern system is proof that such a combination will inevitably equilibrate toward central planning and government overspending. I would love a representative democracy with severe limitations, primarily focused on national defense and court arbitration. But what we have now is a monster of oligarchical control over our entire lives masquerading as a democracy. We agree that the status quo is not sustainable. A great place to start on reworking the model. Agreed there!"

One perspective I will add on regulation is that having worked my way up in production supply chain operations in the food industry I have seen a lot of ridiculous State and Federal rules that add cost with little to no benefit. I have also seen large players in the grocery business apply their own fees basically taxes to sell to them to their smaller suppliers and farmers that also increase food inflation. However, food safety is an area where small to large businesses will take shortcuts for many reasons, including the cost to keep up 3rd party audit compliance, internal expertise and quality control staffing. However, I dont think it would be wise to throw out the baby with the bathwater and completely eliminate the FDA USDA."

My comment served to point out that the very topic of this discussion is a counterexample to this rule. The US government borrows US dollars and that process has grossly devalued the currency.

I just think Buffet is being either trolly, or has gone full Dino boomer mode to be hoarding cash. You cant seriously be telling me in one breath that the US economy is amazing, and with the next telling me that sitting on what is essentially more cash than the US Fed is an optimistic take on the economy."

And you own a million TBills each at 100 paying 5 a year. Those TBills will still pay 5 a year, their principle value however will grow to 200 to adjust to the 2.5 interest rate by the fed. So actually, Buffett owning a lot of TBills means he expects rate cuts soon. Dont expect to make a 100 return overnight though, its more complicated than that. You still have to contend with a slow pace of rate cuts and the fact that these TBills lose principle value after each monthly payment as the government pays back some of the principle with interest"

US Treasuries US government bonds come in two categories the bills the short term bonds, which mature in one year or less and the notes the longer term bonds, like the 2Year, 10Year, etc.. They are how the government raise money, how the Federal Reserve the Fed performs quantitative easing, the backbone of the repo market transactions between banks and financial institutions, the main ingredient of the money markets, and I can keep going. I cant write about all that here, and there are many more aspects of the financial system where Treasuries are a key ingredient of their plumbing that Im not even very familiar with, because the global financial system is vast and growingmutating every year. Thats why anytime you hear someone say X currency will replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency very soon, you immediately know that they have no clue about the global financial system. I suggest you learn about the various aspects I mentioned above on your own and keep exploring from there. You cant do it in one sitting. It will take time. The aspects most relevant to Buffetts move is that short end of the yield curve that is, the yield on the short term Treasuries will collapse when a recession hits. This is because in the normal structure of the yield curve, the short end is lower than the long end that is, the yield on the long term Treasuries. But when the Fed raises the Fed funds rate same thing people are referring to when they say the Fed is changing the interest rate, but there are many other things that are also called interest rate, so Im using the precise name here to make it easier for you look up more of this, the short end of the yield curve rises this happened in 2022. Unless there are other factors forcing the long end to also rise as much as the short end, then you end up with an inverted yield curve. Its not easy for the Fed to influence the long end of the yield curve thats what quantitative easing tries to do, but the market for the long end is so deep and liquid. When there is a recession, the Fed is forced to reduce the Fed funds rate, and therefore the short end of the yield curve drops faster than the long end. This means anyone that buys up the short end what Buffetts company has been doing will rake in so much money. If there is no recession, you can still just hold those bonds to maturity the yield on them are 45 and the only loss is in the form of opportunity cost i.e., missing out on better returns elsewhere."

We just got our wires crossed a bit. The Fed owns a ton of different kinds of government debt. TBills mature in 1 month to a year. Treasury Notes mature in 210 years. Treasury Bonds mature in 20 or 30 years. Theres also a ton of other kinds of government debt that the Fed buys and holds. The article above is only talking about TBills, which is kind of misleading. Also, youre talking about the first vs. second derivative here. Think velocity vs. acceleration in a car. A car that is going 30 MPH, but accelerates to 60 feels very different from a car going 80 that hits the brakes and decelerates to 70. The Fed engaged in quantitative easing and bought a ton of Treasuries and other types of debt. Its went 100 MPH to flee the Covid monster chasing it. Now its trying to get rid of them. It can take its foot off the accelerator and brake pedal and just coast to a stop. It can lightly press the brakes. Or it can slam the brakes. Normalizing means going the speed limit. The Fed constantly has to buy new TBills to replenish the maturing ones which happens in less than a year. But the pace is what matters. Thats why it uses terms like balance sheet run off and tapering."

QoL is a very qualitative variable, trying to just draw quantitative differences is something that carries little affinity for generalization if youre speaking in terms of statistical power. The reality is that the correlation between simple net worth and QoL is likely logarithmic at a certain point you can only inhabit so many yachts at one time. Youre also discounting the aspect that the modern valuations of msft are only the way that they are due to its public availability as a tradeable instrument, the liquidity of which is directly tied Bill Gates having diversified his portfolio as a founder shareholder. In short, you can quantifiably say that MSFT would be worth what it is today if Bill Gates hadnt diversified, and so the 1T in net worth that you speak of is purely hypothetical.

On Monday the panic spread around the world, effecting nearly every major exchange having the worst day in a decade if not longer. The Nikkie crashed worse than it did in 1987 and in 1987 when it crashed like that it drug the NYSE down with it it took 2 full years for the NYSE to recover from that day. Pre market selloff was so bad it forced Lehman Bros into bankruptsy a major hedgefund lost solvency and got margin called, damn shit look bad. I was drooling to buy puts. The morning bell gets rung, the NYSE tooted a line, brushed all that shit off and just started pumping, fucked my puts over and I lost my shirt cause of it. If that shit didnt cause a crash, aint much Im seeing that can. Bottom line is the American Economy looks healthy, it aint perfect, but it sure as shit is nowhere near a recession.

The interest rate hike in Japan caused the drop in the Nikkei which then led to the drop followed by quick recovery in the US markets. The spike in the VIX was really every algo getting caught with their pants down since Japan having some kind of interest rate caused the yen forex strategy to completely unwind and people were forced in to margin calls and no one has that modeled well. Once the open auction was set, retail panicked, but institutional saw the opportunity as cheap as we already started to get to the tail end of a 10 correction. The validation of this was watching VOO and IWM. Both of those held up better than the large cap market weighted indexes. Were in a rotational and seasonal shift as people try to chase earnings now. What leads to a recession is that the market wants to broaden the rally, but earnings kind of sucked this quarter. Q3 wont look much better if better at all. So if the rally falters, it basically pulls the rug out until JPow saves it with a tax cut. The market is already so disjointed and mega cap valuations are extremely high. People are going to run out of effective places to deploy cash which creates the Buffet situation where it stays on the sideline. Money just sitting creates a recession more than anything else."
