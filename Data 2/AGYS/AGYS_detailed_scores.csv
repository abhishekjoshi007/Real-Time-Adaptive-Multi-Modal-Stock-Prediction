Reddit,2024-09-14,"I challenge your ChatGpT bear post with my bull case gpt post. We can do this all day. The bull case for NVIDIA, despite the potential cracks in the AI scaling hypothesis, remains compelling due to a number of factors 1. AI Beyond Scaling Diversification of Architectures While the scaling hypothesis may face limitations, NVIDIA is not solely reliant on larger models for growth. The shift towards diverse architecturessuch as edge computing, federated learning, and more efficient, adaptable modelsstill heavily depends on advanced hardware. NVIDIAs innovation in custom AI chips and specialized GPUs for varied workloads ensures that it continues to dominate, even as the industry pivots away from pure scale. 2. AI Software Ecosystem NVIDIAs CUDA platform, AI software stack, and Deep Learning SDKs offer essential tools for AI developers. These tools are deeply integrated across the AI research and enterprise ecosystems, which means that even if scaling slows, NVIDIAs software dominance secures its position as a key player. Moreover, AI companies are dependent on NVIDIAs endtoend platform, from training to deployment, and this dependency is unlikely to change even if the emphasis shifts from scale to smarter, more efficient architectures. 3. Enterprise and Data Center Expansion Even beyond researchdriven AI, enterprise adoption of AI is growing rapidly. Companies across industriesfinance, healthcare, and logisticsare integrating AI into their operations, and this trend fuels continued demand for highperformance computing HPC solutions. NVIDIAs foothold in data centers is a major asset, as demand for AIpowered insights and automation continues to grow. The company is positioned to benefit from AIdriven automation, which is expected to scale massively in the next few years. 4. AI in Autonomous Systems NVIDIAs leadership in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other AIdriven automation solutions offers another strong growth avenue. The companys Drive platform for autonomous driving and its investments in industrial robots and AIpowered edge devices place NVIDIA in a favorable position as automation accelerates across multiple industries. 5. Gaming and Virtual Worlds Metaverse While AI remains the main growth driver, NVIDIAs core business in gaming is still robust, and its investment in the metaverseparticularly via its Omniverse platformis positioned for future growth. The convergence of AI, VR, and GPUpowered graphics in virtual worlds will open up new revenue streams, ensuring that NVIDIAs hardware remains in demand across various sectors beyond traditional AI use cases. 6. AI Custom Silicon and Competition NVIDIA is investing heavily in custom silicon AIspecific hardware. The Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchip, alongside nextgen H100 GPUs, cater to evolving needs in AI and HPC. These chips optimize AI workloads and enable costeffective scaling, keeping NVIDIA ahead of competitors like AMD and Intel. 7. AI as a Deflationary Force The massive potential of AI to create efficiencies across industries means that the macroeconomic environment will continue to favor companies like NVIDIA. As AI proves its worth in reducing operational costs, improving supply chains, and automating workflows, NVIDIAs role in supplying the necessary infrastructure will keep demand strong. Conclusion Bull Case for NVDA Despite possible challenges to the scalability hypothesis, NVIDIA remains a key enabler of the AI economy. Its leadership in hardware and software, expansion into new markets like autonomous vehicles, and diverse revenue streams provide a strong foundation for continued growth. Even if the AI bubble bursts in some areas, the underlying technological advancements and enterprise applications are likely to sustain NVIDIAs trajectory.",Positive,2,0.9999943375587463,Reply

NVIDIAs moat is both CUDA and hardware but there are other indirect moats for example, ML frameworks integration with CUDA is strong Pytorch, Tensorflow, JAX and open source models such as ONNX and ONNXRuntime are sort of heavily influenced by Microsoft. Its not as simple as creating an ez software layer when Sagemaker and Vertex AI have been around for quite some time now. Besides, CUDA and cuDNN is not even in the software layer. First, they have to be able to create an incredibly efficient chip for both training and inference, second a CUDAequivalent, third to steer ML frameworks to force it to adopt a new nonCUDA architecture, fourth is to force researchers and developers to develop new models catered to the new hardwares alongside all dependencies, etc. People who hasnt trained complex models or created them or deployed them are so uninformed about how tightly integrated NVIDIA is to everything. Tech moats are a different kind of moat. Integrations are one strong thing in tech. And NVIDIAs moat is just incredibly complex. Companies that serve AI products will have to redesign their huge pipeline, redo bunch of their codes, retrain some models, etc. when a new nonCUDA thing and nonNVIDIA hardware happens.

My personal thinking is that Google is gonna bottleneck itself with their own TPU hardware sooner or later as they are either gonna fully commit to it or just suddenly pivot using NVIDIA again similar to their switch from Qualcomm to Tensor G1G4 with Samsung fabs to TSMC moving foward. They will, however, be perpetually contending within the leaderboards for LLM although my personal favorites leading these would still be META and OpenAI for different reasons.

Reddit,2024-08-14,"Not an FI, and I am a long term investor but only on things I understand thats why my portfolio is like 60 ETFs and about 30 individual tech stocks since I have spare money and Im fine with high risks. I dont hold any of AMD and Google just because I am still incredibly confused as to what their goals are. Personally I dont think Google will outpace NVIDIA and they are two different companies. Google is software and Nvidia is hardware CUDA which isnt really a replicable software. Googles direct competitor is Microsoft and somehow META. I just think that Googles software side is incredibly replicable and that the shift from perspectives that their sales are gonna go from ads to AI will have a tough time. On the software end, I got Microsoft or even META. META just because Gen AI tools is going to be extremely connected to their biggest shtick which is content creator platforms, and the fact that META, IMHO, has the best AI research team. FAIR has been producing the best AI papers for the past years most esp in computer vision. People dont know that things such as Magic Eraser, Magic Lasso Tool root itself from METAs Segment Anything which is the most ground breaking thing in Computer Vision alongside Diffusion Models. Microsoft too have strong integrations with software from Teams to MS Office suite and Windows. Most underrated is Github and Github Copilot. They literally own a shit ton of free code to train LLM models. For AMD, I am not so well versed on their products. They wont be able to compete with NVIDIA some time in the future. Honestly, if I were them, I would just try to completely dunk on the sinking ship that is Intel and fabricate CPUs that tightly integrate with NVIDIA GPUs on cloud clusters i do have a local AMD Ryzen laptop with RTX i use for local small training of models. Current virtual machines right now still have Intel NVIDIA GPUs e.g. V100, A10G. If AMD will just focus on beating Intel instead of NVDA, they could just win the AI race alongside them. If NVIDIA gets tired of Intels bullshit, I can see them fabricating their own CPUs. NVIDIA will still be the strongest contender by a mile for atleast 57 years. I cant see anyone coming closely to rivaling their moat until then. Even if a war breaks out in Taiwan and new chips halt in production for some time, the remaining functioning data centers can still function IMO. One company that I suggest worth looking at is definitely Qualcomm. They are trying to enter the desktop space and making the edge device phones, etc. much beefier to have its own Neural Processing Unit that are capable to run multimodal models. As phones get better in that, they have less need to access cloud servers which in turn means less need for GPU servers NVIDIA. Although Qualcomms direct competitor at that space is Apple which is gonna do the same. I am not an FI, but as an AI engineer, I am bullish on NVIDIA. I would definitely think that it is quite overhyped by people right now because it has been an AI arms race and every one is trying to race which AI product will be the first to profit. The purchasing will slow down. However, believe it or not, we are just scratching the surface for what AI can do. Diffusion models are just only around for about 3 years, LLMs for 2.5 years, and we havent reached those breakthroughs to the traditional AI real money makers yet such as detection and reinforcement learning but I have a feeling that it will come out sooner. But the thing is that comparing it to crypto is crazy because AI has business use cases and profitable as long as it has the proper market. NVIDIA is just creating more data centers to keep up with the cloud service demands from AWS, Azure, etc. but even if the demand gets low, they can always sell the access to services for cheap and still get money from it. But who knows, thats the free market for you.",Neutral,0,0.9818336069583893,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Consumerfocused AI reminds me of those 1950s automatic kitchens. Where they press a button and a drawer takes 5 minutes to open, and that never caught on in the mainstream. When I have seen it presented to me, for example in Facebook, it has been bothersome and more trouble than its worth. And to the extent it will get better . . then why is Zuckerburg pitching use cases that almost nobody will care about like practicing difficult conversations with a robot.

Reddit,2024-09-19,"AI impact will be, short term, no different than Internet impact. Lots of people were let go, new businesses and whole sectors of economy appeared. So the initial within next 1 3 years AIrelated layoffs will be accommodated by the economy. The situation becomes tricky in mid to long term as AIs take over a large number of whitecollar jobs in creative fields from medical diagnosis to new products design and research. As required human participation in the economy declines, an obvious question of what those humans would do for a living in such economic structure comes forward. Market economy cannot work unless there is a large pool of people who are able to sell their labor, and a more or less matching pool of businesses that are in need of it. You mess with one side of this balance and you get either inflation or worse deflation, when nobody can afford the goods the business makes even at break even point. Without a serious economic restructuring, that is where our economy will end up with AI help. The issue is, if left to own devices of current economic system, the restructuring will result in an economic crisis not seen from the time of the Great Depression. And, our heart bleeding conservatives do not want the government to move a finger short of changing one number. Because of the ideological reasons, because of the perverted misunderstanding of what the free market is. So let it burn! Be forewarned.",Negative,-1,0.8027710914611816,Reply

It sounds like you are more on the ai producing mega tech company end rather than the big business consuming the ai product to increase productivity end. I am aware it does not cut down on a lot for you aside from speeding up some redundant basic coding etc, maybe summarizing some emails or writing some email first drafts if you dont feel like it that day. You likely already know this, but other business are finding ways to use ai to increase efficiency productivity. That is why the sector is growing. That is why there is demand for the product. Its early on for sure, but I dont think saying there is a 15 boost to productivity for office staff on the consumer side of ai is unreasonable or unrealistic. Even if its a bit shy of that currently, its only going to get better. If ai truly will not increase productivity or efficiency at all, then what good is it? It can harvest more data from consumers I suppose windows 11 comes to mind, but that wont be enough to justify the massive cost of building out these ai data centers and keeping them operational going forward.

Reddit,2024-08-11,"NVidia had the install base to be an early AI powerhouse and then carried the momentum with CUDA. What worries me is what happened with Crypto there was a market glut, and then the market flooded with clapped out Nvidia cards, still at high prices on the used market. Massive power consumption is already a joke. Any kind of energy crisis including one that the huge spike in power usage from AI is nudging us closer to would leave them scrambling for power efficiency in a way that companies like Apple have on lock and AMD has been beating them on for years. So... CUDA. Basically the only thing holding AMD cards back from running CUDA is a bit of weird haze around the licensing of CUDA. Its not a technical limitation, and hasnt been for a while now. IMHO, NVidia has the skill and technology to keep their run going, but if they dont focus on it soon their entire market leadership is at risk of popping with a little bip with a loss over the licensing of CUDA.",Negative,-1,0.9994589686393738,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-11,"To add points. 1. Competing with Nvidia is going to be next to impossible. Look at Nvidia prior to AI. They dominated and still dominate GPU sales. If you were a gamer, Nvidia was the way to go. Intel has been trying to break into the GPU industry beyond iGPU for a while now. Id bet and I am betting they got 10 years before they get anywhere. AMD has always been second to Nvidia. There were a few times AMD made something a little faster than Nvidia but then a month or two later, Nvidia would roll something out better than that. Nvidia has a track record of holding the 1. position. Thats not about to change. I dont see any other players, including outside of intel and AMD, being able to out run Nvidia. 2. TSMC is not an issue. If China wants to take Taiwan, they would be dumb to make it an issue for Nvidia. Because the US gov will not tolerate it. China doesnt want war. Not with Taiwan or with the US. They want global business dominance. China Taiwan relations will likely cause a little stock moving but in the long run it wont matter. Also 6 months isnt the long run. 3. AI isnt hype. For short term players, it will be hype for them. Only because something like this takes time to grow. There will likely be moments of massive upswings but its still in the building phase. For those seeing this as a long term play, this isnt hype. This will change the world. Once AI enters the physical world, thru robots and other machines, its going to revolutionize the world. 4. Im not some AI hype person, Ive been reluctant for some time, Ive seen enough and work with many that build off AI platforms, and I see where we are headed. This is going to be massive! Nvidia is going benefit more than anyone else. 5. If you think we are already passed the gold rush and its over... call me in 35 years. I think Nvidia having a market cap of 510 trillion isnt out of the question. Probably more. Were at the cusp of something world changing, this is like facebook back in 20052007. Its gaining momentum but its not fully there yet. Imagine being able to buy into facebookmeta prior to IPO and you know now what its worth. Id do that deal. Pretty sure everyone would. That is Nvidia right now. Only real concern I have is insiders selling right now. Thats it. I understand they probably want some liquidity, I dont blame them. Still, not a fan of the selling.

Reddit,2024-08-11,Yeah and he used the worst type of chart analysis. Like two points connected. I guess stonks always go up. And while I believe that nvidia will have good numbers in the near term. EVERYBODY is working on alternatives. Because nobody wants to keep paying nvidia a 90 margin. Amd has pretty impressive training gpus and all the big guys work on their own tpus. So this 90 margin business wont last for too long. Just too much money involved for people to not find alternatives.,Positive,1,0.9999817609786987,Reply

While its true that broader market sentiment has shifted since AprilMay, there are a few reasons why I believe NVDAs stock could still perform well in the short term 1. AI Demand The demand for AI and highperformance computing has surged even more since AprilMay. Nvidias leadership in this space, especially with their GPUs, continues to drive strong growth, which could support the stock price. 2. Earnings Momentum Nvidias recent earnings reports have consistently beaten expectations, driven by higherthanexpected demand in data centers and AIrelated products. If this trend continues, it could offset broader market concerns. 3. Investor Sentiment While profittaking is always a possibility, theres still a lot of excitement around Nvidias role in the AI revolution. This enthusiasm could keep the stock buoyant, even if broader market sentiment is lukewarm. In short, while market sentiment is always a factor, Nvidias strong fundamentals and positioning in a highgrowth sector could lead to shortterm gains, even in a challenging broader market environment.",Positive,1,0.9999998807907104,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-11,"Heres ChatGPTs answer he may be biased Thats a good question! Heres how I see it Yes, Nvidia is primarily making its money by supplying hardware, especially GPUs that are critical for AI, machine learning, and highperformance computing. As of now, they dont have any serious rivals that can match their performance in these areas, and thats not likely to change in the near future. While its true that the broader interest in AI might seem lukewarm right now due to a lack of mainstream applications, Nvidia is deeply embedded in the infrastructure that will power future AI developments. Once more practical and widespread applications of AI are realized, Nvidias products will be at the core of those innovations, likely driving up demandand the stock price along with it. As for other manufacturers catching up, its possible, but Nvidia has such a strong lead in both hardware and software ecosystems that any new competitors would have a tough time breaking into the market in a meaningful way before Nvidia reaps the benefits of the AI boom. So, I believe Nvidia is wellpositioned for future growth as AI becomes more practically applied.",Positive,1,0.9924045205116272,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-11,The next best thing that is generally available is AMD. But Last Q4 50 of Nvidia sales went to Microsoft and Meta. Google didnt buy much because they have their own optimized Tensor Processing Units based on readily available tensor processing chips from Broadcom.

Meta is heavily investing in building their own and if Google can do it Meta will do too. Silicon Valley hiring is a revolving door . Microsoft and Amazon are investing in it as well and Apple is building their own.You can be almost sure that sometimes in 20252026 all the big Silicon Valley companies will have their own.
