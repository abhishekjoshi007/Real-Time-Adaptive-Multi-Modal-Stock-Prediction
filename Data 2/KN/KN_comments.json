This means that the factory delivers roughly one 737 per day. A 737 costs 100M. Boeing cannot produce 737s while the workers are on strike, which means Boeing isnt getting their 100M cash deposit per day. This isnt factoring in the loss of revenue due to the Everett site being affected, which produces the 777F, 777X, and 767F, 767T. Everett makes up the other 50 million of costs. This 150M in lost revenue cash is what is causing the multitude of cost cutting measures such as furlough. Additionally, Boeing is currently rated BBB, and the credit rating agencies said the only reason Boeing isnt at junk bond status is because of their 400 billion dollar backlog. They cant take out more debt in risk of going to junk bond status. They need this strike to end ASAP"

Airbus is building planes in Alabama with a much cheaper labor force wo quality issues. Boeing should move 737 assembly lines to Charleston to better compete. The union is angry that Dave got 30 million stock not cash. This was part of the contract, no way around that for his failed leadership but they are demanding 1 billion and couldnt install the door properly. Boeing doesnt lose 100mday. Boeings delaying 100m worth of revenue based on the planes list prices. For Boeing, the situation this year is better than 2020. They already delivered YTD more planes than the entire 2020. BSC is still delivering 787. The company doesnt have to pay for machinists in PNW 6.5 million per day and will have 12.6 billion in cash. It becomes a waiting game. I just want Boeing to take this opportunity to move the 737 assembly lines. The contract is no longer valid so nothing is holding it back."

If I was management, long term, I would focusing moving production to places where COL is reasonable to match. PNW COL has been destroyed by the Tech Sector, creating a society of the haves and have nots, and it is unrealistic for most companies to keep up with that type of inflation. For Boeing it will be a lot easier to match COL in say Arkansas vs Washington State."

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a very strong position, Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a reputational level too. Im absolutely on the side of the workersunion here. However, I suspect that Boeing doesnt really care about their reputation here as much as people think, or the public support behind the union. They have a near monopoly in their business, at least in terms of output capacity which is desperately needed in a critical field. It feels like poison saying it but that affords them the privilege to ignore reputation damage for a long time. Theres no where else for buyers to go, they have to deal with Boeing, trashed reputation or not. However this strike ends I suspect Boeing will push to move 737 production out of the PNW into areas like Atlanta and SC where unions arent as protected. Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October. This is going to be the downfall of Boeing that leads to some sort of inevitable government bailout. Shareholder primacy and value extraction mindset has been taken further and further over the cliff the last 50 years. Even with all of the recent revelations about the company, shareholders DEMAND the next quarter earnings be turned around. Its clear to anyone whos ever worked in any type of operations role that Boeing needs a solid 510 year turn around cycle to get it back on track, break even sure but put aside profits. Shareholders wont allow a reinvestment into the company. The name of the game on Wall Street with companies this large is value extraction, never growth or value retention."

Not sure why this was even listed seems more like a shiny thing for the media. 3. higher 401k contributions has no meaning without specifics could be higher by 1 we dont know. There is information on what this means, and whether it approaches filling the void left by terminating pensions. Since they didnt provide specifics as they did in 1 and 2 we might infer that higher isnt significantlymeaningfully higher. In summary, the offer provided was only very slightly improved from the offer already voted down. Seems like more a media stunt than actual negotiation.

Basically the old shareholders got wiped out, the US government formed and owned most of new GM, which it eventually sold I think for an overall loss. Being a shareholder has risk, one of which is the failure of the business you invest in. That risk is why shareholders are entitled to profits. Thats true capitalism.

The whistleblowers were union employees trying to bring attention to managements poor decisions and allowing bad QC. So yeah its the management allowing and encouraging bad production, along with poor payhours which also disincentivizes employees to do good work. Edit I should add that Im not really prounion. Unions were needed at a time and significantly improved workers quality of life, but now I think theyre holding back workers or protecting bad employees see police unions. In todays world we can have strikes and call out companies on a global scale without unions or paying huge feesdue, its really up to consumers and producers to not tolerate corrupt companies and to make sure our governments arent bailing out corrupt companies. With all that said it isnt the unions fault Boeing is a cluster fuck evil company, its management and the US government not allowing them to fail"

There is an entire decade before 2019 you know in which the company was making so much money and you know how much the workers got from it? 8 pay increase in last 16 years with the deduction of pension and tons of other health benifits.. You say like they are getting 30 pay increase in 4 year in reality it is 38 pay increase in 20 years with deduction of pension, mandetory overtime, reduction in bonuses. So when the company is doing really well the executives should pat themselves and call well it is capitalism but when their decisions run it to the ground the workers should pay for it? Capitalism for the profits, socialism for the losses am I right?"

Maybe you mean yall or the Royal You, like you people in this reddit sub? Totally folding in a negotiation is a foolish decision yes, but that clearly hasnt happened here. Negotiations preceeding this went on a long time, which means both sides made sacrifices. The 737 Max is made by this union, and is very profitable. If this strike halts production, that is a foolish decision. Airplane buyers e.g. Alaska Airlines are a customer, and delayed delivery makes an already difficult customer service situation worse."

There are a LOT of whistleblowers that talk about unsafe manufacturing process or directives. The amount of issues seen in the last few years with Boeing planes all points to systemic failure in the manufacturing and quality control of planes. The fact that you try to somehow convince me that it is not Boeings fault but their suppliers or subcontracting entities fault is laughable. Even if it was, it is absolutely Boeings fault that they let the work of suppliers and subcontractors be the cause of so many issues by not applying proper quality control and mamufacturing reviews. This all point to systematic cost cutting in QC and Boeings own manufacturing capabilities that heavily inpacted Boeings ability to identify and solve issues before they cause accidents. Cheaper isnt always better, especially when you are talking about planes. But I guess shooting a you know nothing makes you feel good and important, so please be my guest."
