They said go... and I trust them so I sold my long position at a huge loss and now have a short opened... which is also currently in loss.  Urgh.  But I think they are decent guys and know their stuff... so I am hopeful to make a stack of money when this goes down... all the way to zero.  Thanks Arg and mike.  I really appreciate your help.  Come Arqit.  Go down!"

The stock had clearly btoomed and reversed.  So just some basic technical analysis if you want to make a high probabilty trade:  Look at Apr 1st.  The stock had peaked and then fell below previous highs on Nov. 14 and Feb. 12.  You could have gotten in earlier but the probabilty would be higher if you waited till it broke support.  It stopped going down in Jun/Jul.  You would have had $8 profit.  You could have decided to go long there but to be safe you would look for it to go above the high in July. Trade might of worked or maybe not, but in hindshight in didn&#39;t and that&#39;s where having a reasonable stop and not going in too big if you&#39;re not very sure come in."

I am guessing $2.50 again - so net its not a cash raise - just a free warrant issued to the insiders - the $13m goes back onto the balance sheet.Can someone explain what i have got wrong here - thanks"
