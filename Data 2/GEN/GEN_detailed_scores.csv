Reddit,2024-10-29,"From a personal standpoint Apple has a level of consumer trust that is not matched for me by any other tech brand. Googles search has gone to shit. Microsoft has started throwing shady ads for its AI on my login screens and comes up with feature like what if we just grabbed screenshots of your PC at random. Meta is.... well, called Meta now despite the utter failure of the Metaverse, and I interact with its products as little as I can. Netflix got its content carved up when everyone else started their own streaming services and then cracked down on account sharing. Apple... does what I need it to do. I got AirPods for the first time a while ago, and I was blown away by how convenient they were compared to most Bluetooth tech and the noise canceling was surprisingly good. I got a new iPhone recently, and I set it next to my old one and all my settings and info transferred over automatically. The most recent annoyance Ive had with an Apple product is... removing the headphone jack? So, a complaint from like a decade ago. Boeing looked good on paper for a long time.

They havent been bringing more money in, or appreciably growing any of its businesses. Their products are profitable, but its not correct to say they are growing. Instead, Tesla has been cutting costs significantly to offset this lack of growth, as well as getting significant carbon offset credits. The issue is the former is a temporary measure, at best, to increase the short term profits, but has severe consequences downline as you May ah be left without the staff to grow at all. The second is a concern because this isnt a sustainable product. Im not knocking him for using them, but a pretty significant portion of the profits this quarter are roughly 13 are purely from an unsustainable source. This is not good news for the future. For all intents and purposes, Tesla is looking to sell just as many vehicles this year as last year, and revenue only marginally better. They are.increasing profits, but this is likely due to cutting costs through labor and the like, which can have severe downline impacts on growth.

Reddit,2024-10-24,People want to get in a car and drive it. They dont want to faff about with apps or cards at a charger which nonTeslas will still have to do at Tesla superchargers. Its a small thing but thats stuff that matters to people. Small conveniences add up. Similarly people want their home battery system to just work and not bother them with details. They want their car charged intelligently when the price of power is lowest. Actually no one wants a car in the first place. What you want is mobility and possibly the occasional transport capacity. A car is just a necessary evil to have that. If people could get from A to B without any effort like annual service checkups or getting gas or all the big and small things you have to do to keep your car in shape at the same price point they would. This is e.g. the idea behind robotaxi. The future market for battery storage is huge. Like in the automobile market theres room for several players with very healthy margins while demand far outpaces supply. So for the next couple years I wouldnt worry about Tesla not being able to scale sales numbers and sell their packs at a very nice asking price last I checked they were already sold out for the next two years or so. While demand is high there is no also reason for Samsung to offer theirs cheaper. If you sell everything you can push out the factory door you try and get the highest price you can.

If you have a battery a charger a car and the app from the same company then it just integrates easily e.g. if you want to be part of a VPP. Can you do this with a Samsung battery? Yes. Is it a lot more tricky to set up and do you have to start faffing about with multiple setup systemsApps? Also yes. People are not tied to their refrigerator brand. Because a refrigerator doesnt integrate into anything. Its standalone. Theres no communication going on not that people havent tried...but the utility just isnt there If the whole idea is demand will be so high you can basically set the price you want, Up to a point that point being that it has to have an ROI within a reasonable amount of time. If youre production constrained then its bad business selling at a price that gives an ROI in 3 years instead of 5 as long as you find enough buyers that are OK with an ROI of 5 years to soak up all your production. And at these stock prices with this multiple, its not about the next couple of years. Its about the next decades. Well at that point you have to judge whether Tesla is an innovative company that can continue to generate products that open up new marketsenter in such productionconstrained markets early to have big margins like robotaxi or the Semi or Tesla bot.

This thread also goes into all the reasons why AI has disappointed while talking about beneficiaries it doesnt seem like youre that confident in the ability to deliver on the end products when it comes to AI. 2 I think the timing is very difficult. I dont disagree with what youre saying in regards to spending and Ill admit that I thought this cycle would be a giant version of smaller previous NVDA cycles and it still probably will, but on a longermuch longer time frame than Id expected. Yes, mega cap tech is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on this. No, shareholders dont really care yet and what does it take to change so many peoples one investment playbook from basically own mega cap tech? I dont know and to try and predict thatcall the top because one thinks its an eventuality without any indications of things starting to erode is going to lead to disappointment. So, I dont disagree with some of the things you mention but the specifics are tough I do think that theres an interesting conversation about AI beneficiaries. I talked about VST early this year on here as an AI beneficiary and the response was crickets because it was like nobody wanted to hear anything AIrelated that wasnt tech. Mag 7 have had a good year, but things that are beneficiaries of all that spending NVDA primarily, but things like VRT have had a better year imo.

I think that there are potentially interesting discussions on peoples guesses for beneficiaries in terms of productivity and theres not enough discussion on here of whats being impacted call center software FIVN clearly not a beneficiary.

Reddit,2024-09-01,"I worked for a competitor of IBM for years, so I acknowledge my bias. That said, I found IBM to be a kind of cult to many customers in the 80s and 90s, and a few even now. At first, enterprises looked at IBM as the Cadillac of computing. They locked in many places with their mainframe computing the IBM 360 was a staple of business. The biggest places had sales staff with personal relations to the C level of enterprises and sole sourced the equipment. UNIVAC, DEC, Tandem and others to a lesser extent. As the 80s and 90s rolled around, Big Blue kept high prices on their Cadillac and although they rolled out their UNIX AIX and virtually invented the PC, the pricing was high, proprietary in an open source minded world and they lost market share. For one retail company, the Bd of Directors required competitive bidding, and even though any competitor could provide less price and equal or superior function, IBM would be awarded the work because we are used to them. Finally others stopped bidding the pointless exercise it was just to press IBM to keep their pricing down. When the old guard retired, and the enterprise realized the premium they paid for obsolete proprietary systems it was too late. They still used the IBM OS2 PC into the 2000s. They went from sales of billions to bankruptcy. I am convinced their cult belief in IBM and failure to modernize contributed. I did a study for multiple companies that illustrated if they moved off the bloated AIX systems to competitive systems, they would save millions. The paradigm shift always seemed risky, but those that moved were well rewarded. In the last 15 years, where IBM competed against Dell, HPHPE, Fujitsu, Amazon, Microsoft and others for data center refresh, cloud and other updates, they rarely stood the test, unless it was from one of those cultist enterprises who had decided before the bid. They still have a mainframe market it is expensive to migrate but not impossible. Their database product , PC, AIX and others are considered by most to be old iron. Even their cloud is a bit proprietary and pricey iron cloud. Watson has been discussed Their quantum computing research is admirable but given their history of trying to make things proprietary so they can keep price and margin high, I wont expect it to play well with others. It is vaporware somewhat. All said, their sales and margins and employee count are down to 23 of the numbers 10 years ago. The legacy of arrogance. I vote thumbs down.

Strategists dont have to spend as much time looking for specific data now that Ai can find some of the patterns much quicker. Ive also seen them create the target market persona pages using Ai. There is still a lot of human input required to create a working strategy, but Ai has sped up the process. Take this section with a grain of salt since its not what I interact with the most, just what Ive heard from friends. Creatively, Ai has mainly sped up a lot of the behind the scenes work. Pitch theater if you will. I used to work in an agency in which art directors were photoshop gurus and could mock something up to elevate a concept. That is now a thing of the past, generative Ai can do that so much quicker. Its not perfect, but when youre trying to just pitch something internally, Ai is more than good enough. Also, why use stock images when you can get Ai to create much more custom imagery to represent your idea. Its not uncommon to use Ai as the foundation and then incorporate photoshop to truly hone the visual. All in all, you dont need as many people to be part of pitches now. When we hire external production companies I now see countless Ai images. A production company had one of their character concept artists run their 2D drawings through Ai to show how they would look in 3D. These were still flat images, not renders, but I was incredibly surprised by quality of mock. You wouldve NEVER gotten to see 3D visuals of a character before getting client approval on the concept art, but with Ai you can now accelerate things that were further down the pipeline. Copywriting. I mean, not much to add here. Long scripts and ideation still gets a lot of love from my coworkers, but the quick tweets and captions that they used to hate, thats Ai work now. This is probably simplifying A LOT of things, but I cant deny that Ai is already altering the workspace. Mainly by making everything move a lot faster, and if there is one thing that advertising clients LOVE, its fast. The pace of advertising has always been relentless, and in some way, Ai has come to both alleviate and exacerbate the problem. If your agency can produce more ads that target more people, you can bring more clients. The industry has changed and many clients are doing one off projects instead of signing annual contracts with agencies, but thats not to say agency of record is not a thing anymore. An advertising agency is not just selling individual ads, its selling a whole suite of creative and strategy services. If Ai can be successfully integrated into this service to cut timelines and budgets, you better believe clients will flock to that agency.",Neutral,-1,0.9456206858158112,Reply

You are clearly way more knowledgeable on your investments and the market as a whole. But Id say, assuming your 50 stocks are somewhat diversified, you have created your own personal index fund of sorts. It would just get tricky if you are actively monitoring each very closely and are able to get emotionally swayed on short term upsdowns. Longterm it would depend on what exactly your risk profile is. In an ideal scenario everything booms and you see colossal gains, but on average your likely to see less than ideal results. Given the time and effort it sounds like you have put into it, it might be slightly more ideal to you than any other index, but your timeeffort doesnt matter to the market.

My current inclination would be to say its not worth it to manage and maintain 50 different stocks because I dont think youll deliver significant outperformance in the longterm. However, if your process turns out to be a real winner and you somehow manage to compound at 20 annually for the next 510 years, Ill have been proven wrong.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"It can be done with rigorous calculations, but doesnt necessarily need to be. A lazy thumbnail approach would probably reveal how the performance compares. From the fact you dont know and are asking these questions, plus some of the investing thesis youve stated, the odds are extremely against you outperforming. Also, a 2 year test is nearly meaningless in terms of actual investing. The rudimentary thumbnail can be this easy tell me what lump sums and dates andor if you did any regularly monthly type contributions and what size. Then tell me todays portfolio balance. Rule of thumb is you should be spending 12 hours per position per week. So it is possible to have 50 positions Ive managed up to 40 for a fund if you put in the time and discipline and patience and are actively managing it. I enjoyed being able to look at the portfolio any given day or week and see overbought positions that could be used to harvest gains, and marry them up to watch lists that had desirable names that were oversold. Out of 40, theres almost always at least a few that are suitable for trading. And of the 40, there could certainly be some that you can tolerate being dead money for months or even years, then theyd move 40 in a day and could be sold to still meet our overall long term investing target return. With 4 positions, it would be much harder to let a dormant position tie up capital for so long. If youre managing a portfolio full time, having a continual schedule of earnings and dividends keeps one engaged and sharp with markets and sentiments. Until you give your numbers, best educated guess is youd be far better off with a small bundle of ETFs for the vast majority of your capital. Maybe you could alot yourself a tiny fund that you give you herself permission to lose every cent, restrict yourself to 5 equal size positions, and then trade your heart out. See if you are the rare exception who can trade well. If you do well with your 5 stock miniport over a tenplus year period, you could consider whether to expand on it. But whatever you do, think of your time versus value. Suppose you being active nets you 12 and passive does 8, then whats that 4 worth and whats your time worth. On a million portfolio, thats 40,000 and maybe 20x501000 hours. Your work and risk is thus worth 40hour. Maybe thats good for you.

Reddit,2024-08-14,"LLM Leaderboards are useless to me at this point in telling which is good or not. The benchmark process is still broken IMHO and there will be more research about how to gauge them better since these are new things. Most application uses anyway such as assistants, chatbots, etc. are finetuned versions anyway, some even using opensource applications. My personal thinking is that Google is gonna bottleneck itself with their own TPU hardware sooner or later as they are either gonna fully commit to it or just suddenly pivot using NVIDIA again similar to their switch from Qualcomm to Tensor G1G4 with Samsung fabs to TSMC moving foward. They will, however, be perpetually contending within the leaderboards for LLM although my personal favorites leading these would still be META and OpenAI for different reasons. GOOG has a personal motivation to do it tho since they have the Google Assistant thing which is probably their biggest usage of this in addition to GSuite additions.

Reddit,2024-08-14,"Not an FI, and I am a long term investor but only on things I understand thats why my portfolio is like 60 ETFs and about 30 individual tech stocks since I have spare money and Im fine with high risks. I dont hold any of AMD and Google just because I am still incredibly confused as to what their goals are. Personally I dont think Google will outpace NVIDIA and they are two different companies. Google is software and Nvidia is hardware CUDA which isnt really a replicable software. Googles direct competitor is Microsoft and somehow META. I just think that Googles software side is incredibly replicable and that the shift from perspectives that their sales are gonna go from ads to AI will have a tough time. On the software end, I got Microsoft or even META. META just because Gen AI tools is going to be extremely connected to their biggest shtick which is content creator platforms, and the fact that META, IMHO, has the best AI research team. FAIR has been producing the best AI papers for the past years most esp in computer vision. People dont know that things such as Magic Eraser, Magic Lasso Tool root itself from METAs Segment Anything which is the most ground breaking thing in Computer Vision alongside Diffusion Models. Microsoft too have strong integrations with software from Teams to MS Office suite and Windows. Most underrated is Github and Github Copilot. They literally own a shit ton of free code to train LLM models. For AMD, I am not so well versed on their products. They wont be able to compete with NVIDIA some time in the future. Honestly, if I were them, I would just try to completely dunk on the sinking ship that is Intel and fabricate CPUs that tightly integrate with NVIDIA GPUs on cloud clusters i do have a local AMD Ryzen laptop with RTX i use for local small training of models. Current virtual machines right now still have Intel NVIDIA GPUs e.g. V100, A10G. If AMD will just focus on beating Intel instead of NVDA, they could just win the AI race alongside them. If NVIDIA gets tired of Intels bullshit, I can see them fabricating their own CPUs. NVIDIA will still be the strongest contender by a mile for atleast 57 years. I cant see anyone coming closely to rivaling their moat until then. Even if a war breaks out in Taiwan and new chips halt in production for some time, the remaining functioning data centers can still function IMO. One company that I suggest worth looking at is definitely Qualcomm. They are trying to enter the desktop space and making the edge device phones, etc. much beefier to have its own Neural Processing Unit that are capable to run multimodal models. As phones get better in that, they have less need to access cloud servers which in turn means less need for GPU servers NVIDIA. Although Qualcomms direct competitor at that space is Apple which is gonna do the same. I am not an FI, but as an AI engineer, I am bullish on NVIDIA. I would definitely think that it is quite overhyped by people right now because it has been an AI arms race and every one is trying to race which AI product will be the first to profit. The purchasing will slow down. However, believe it or not, we are just scratching the surface for what AI can do. Diffusion models are just only around for about 3 years, LLMs for 2.5 years, and we havent reached those breakthroughs to the traditional AI real money makers yet such as detection and reinforcement learning but I have a feeling that it will come out sooner. But the thing is that comparing it to crypto is crazy because AI has business use cases and profitable as long as it has the proper market. NVIDIA is just creating more data centers to keep up with the cloud service demands from AWS, Azure, etc. but even if the demand gets low, they can always sell the access to services for cheap and still get money from it.

My interpretation UpWorks service is good at the beginning of the user journey. To match buyers and sellers. But then it becomes a chore. Because of the weekly invoice cycle and the separate invoicing from sellers and UpWork. That makes it an 8x worse solution than direct seller to buyer invoices. UpWork gained a massive amount of users during covid. And now those users abandon the service. Its a long way down to precovid levels. It can make the business decline for years. On the upside, UpWork might have the potential to become as big as the other market place leaders. Amazon, Uber, Booking, AirBnB, Shopify etc are all orders of magnitude larger than UpWork and I dont see a reason the leading work market place shouldnt become as big as those.

The 13th and 14th gen is the only woldcard that is driving emotions high for an over represented group of edgy gamers who upgrade their CPUs every 24 years. They just tacked on a 2 year extended warranty. Move on. Its just not rational this doom and gloom stance. Logical people are being drowned out by people heavy into Nvidia and who know nothing about the actual products and how it is beyond competitive. Remember Jensens biggest fear.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"I got out of intel 50 in Oct 2021 on the way down and the sentiment back then was the same shit you see today line only go up, timing doesnt beat time, Apple go brrrr nvda now. Glad I did, because its never gone back up since outside of a hedge fund pump and dump simply to convince the masses to buy the deal before they shed their losses despite Intel doing nothing wrong up to recently, and theyre not going anywhere. A cantankerous old man once said you dont need a formal conspiracy when interests converge and I think were seeing that with the market of today. To the moon, right? This bubble is too big to possibly burst, because its the new normal to be overvalued because PE doesnt mean anything since they can get more investors for the next hypetrain. Well... those AI companies are hemorrhaging money, billions, and what happens when those investors come knocking? Well, like we saw today, those who have shared interest will signal to buy at a discount and then opportunistically sell off in afterhours. Public sentiment is bad because a lot of people lost money by thinking line always go up, yet it never did. Besides the nonsense of the modern market, Intel is the one who will support the US when the inevitable happens across the pacific, and public sentiment will change when nobody can get their precious AI chips. The investors are starting to see that AI burns more money than it generates, is projected to burn more, and still hallucinates wildly limiting its usefulness. Metrics dont matter anymore, the market is dominated by converged interests and Intel will remain in the gutter regardless of their news until something sticks, like an issue in the East, and the masses converge and change their tune to its a bargain.",Neutral,0,0.9817604422569275,Reply

But right now, the megacap CEOs are really excited about AI and they have the money to spend on it. They still have good cash flow and can still spend big if they want to. I think LLMs and other applications of transformers will continue to get better, theyll be faster, smaller models will be better, and context windows will be larger before the LLMs start spitting out hallucinations and functionally break. With the right training techniques, which are still evolving, the transformer that LLMs is based on can remarkably improve on really overdetermined data, which breaks what I used to know about signals analysis and training oldschool neural networks. I think we are going through a routine lowvolume summer pullback with hedge funds piling into the previously lagging R2K, which makes momentum plays swing like crazy. But, hedge funds will be back, and theyll long the same positions they shorted months earlier, and then theyll short them again. Its fine for investors to hold the feet of megacaps to the fire, but that just brings their PE multiples closer to normal for a tech stock. Other position disclaimers Google small LT buyandhold position, they are behind and will probably lose search market share but I wont bet against their data and proprietary tensor core iterations Microsoft small longheld position Meta no position due to longstanding antipathy plus I think they are behind with AI and the metaverse and they have more limited room to grow because 3.5 billion users is a lot, even if many of those are bots. I think they will outperform but wont be in the drivers seat. I still dont see how Zuck is going to monetize their opensource LLM models while Microsoft at least has a plan that may kick in when copilot improves and copilot subscriber numbers improve. I may be in the minority, but I think this will happen eventually, cant say when.

Reddit,2024-08-01,"Youre right that YoY growth is a really bad metric to value a high PE stock, as is comparing this quarter this year, vs the same quarter last year. For me to buy a stock with a high PE, it better have higher revenues and higher earnings every quarter and those numbers better have a strong correlation to each other and to EPS those boxes are checked. I like to look at quarterly revenue and EBDITA I have plugged in the numbers, and I would argue that these numbers are both statistically linear. The revenue numbers do a fit a parabolic fit better than a linear fit, hinting at slowing revenue growth. But, the parabolic fit will always be better than the linear fit, whether or not it has meaning, and quarterly earnings reports make for very sparse data. Im expecting roughly linear but moderating revenue and EPS growth and will unload if there is a big surprise to the downside. With linear EPS growth for the next year out, earnings for the next year would be 23 times higher, making the forward PE, which ignores analyst estimates, very reasonable. Growth will probably moderate because of supply chain constraints and moderation in demand. But, Nvidia doesnt need a PE close between 20 and 30 a year out at these prices because highgrowth market leaders always command a PE premium. But, its very plausible that revenue growth is slowing because TSMs production capacity is a bottleneck and it takes a long time to build new fabs, which TSM is doing. However, Nvidia has historically kept its margins very high when there is strong demand. I think the pertinent historical examples are the last bitcoin bubble preASICs and Cisco around its nosebleed peak with a PE over 200. During the crypt0 bubble Nvidia absolutely crushed it while reddit gamers had daily tantrums about Nvidia charging unfair prices for their GPUs. That lasted until ASICs made it unprofitable to mine with an allpurpose GPU, crypt0 started crashing and Nvidia crashed. Im watching Mag 7 cap ex because Cisco collapsed roughly the month after its biggest customers like Worldcom, ATT, AOL, Qwest, and Sprint started dramatically cutting their cap ex. The now bankrupt Worldcom was an outright criminal fraud that was buying Cisco routers to pretend that they were making money to pump their share prices. So Im worried about demand, Im worried about ASICs, respectively thinking about Cisco and the last crypt0 bubble. The main reason I bought more AVGO because its price is down and because OpenAI is building a new secret chip with Broadcom, which is almost certainly a new ASIC chip that will rely on Broadcom and TSM. Also, broadcom should benefit from its auto and manufacturing chips and cell phone sales will probably pick up if rates go down and its a given that they will go down. But, major risks are that the economy is definitely slowing by almost any metric and the Fed is always late with their rate moves, with their backwardlooking data analysis, and whats bad for the economy is bad for everyone. Also, from now to October is historically a very bad time for semis and Wall Street knows it. Also, we know that if investors revolt on spend, CEOs like Zuck will dramatically cut back on cap ex, like he did after the Metaverse crash. I think if one megacap CEO cuts back on GPU spend, they all will, as I feel they are defensively spending to not get left behind, so the script can flip and growth can turn into misses in a hurry. Finally, I feel that most semi and software stocks are overvalued and catching AI tailwinds for no reason and this will hurt the few stocks with good performance, because hedge algos will work to keep correlated pairs of stocks correlated. The conflict between Iran and Israel could blow up in the near future. Also, the performance of bigger and bigger transformers could hit a wall, but I dont think theres evidence of that yet. I dont think humans are special and that there are intrinsic limits about what humans can do and future AI cant. However, better GPUs will someday be locked down even in the U.S., as a national security issue. But, I have a longterm horizon, and the megacaps that are pumping money into NVDA havent cut back on cap ex yet. Nadela says there is still increasing cloud demand and the probability that he is telling truth is greater than the probability that he is lying. I can afford to be wrong about the future and Ill still pay a lot of taxes when I exit.",Positive,2,0.9998914301395416,Reply

If revenue hadnt lagged 20222023 the stock wouldnt have declined, so growth would have been more steady and thus less profound this past year certainly obviously, but the valuation wouldnt be less stratospheric at these revenue and margin numbers. You are really grasping at straws. Theres no pattern here to draw any conclusions and nothing youve said indicates anything about what Aug numbers will look like. The ebbs and flows of how it got from 8B to 26B explain the movement of the stock during that time period, but say little of the future as opposed to revenue at companies like TSM, META, and AMD.

I think Xi Xinping wants an invasion of Taiwan to be his legacy, but I hope his peers will talk him out of tanking Chinas economy even more. If Blackwell has persistent watercooling leak issues, that could be a problem for many years. Blackwell yields could be much lower than expected, since joining chips is a new technology. A president could ban GPUs that are more powerful than a threshold out of fear of AI. Policy could be changed to tax cloud providers unless they use green energy, which I would support. Companies could hit the energy bottleneck, so I bought Dominion energy since the largest server farm concetration is in Northern Virginia and NEE to get a little bit of a dividend barbel. The Supreme Court could rule that LLMs are liable for copyright infringement and that all the AI companies owe tons of money to everyone else. At some point, the first globally damaging AI virus will hit and new laws will be passed. I think calling peaks and bottoms is a losing game and trying to predict a peak years out is even more of a losing game. But, if I had to guess, I think the peak will come when we see dotcomlast crypt0 bubble levels of hype in a lower interest rate environment.

Reddit,2024-10-10,"Of course the big banks are going to recommend alternatives, theyre the highest fee product they sell. I read an article about the Harvard endowment recently and how theyve lagged behind public equities for a decade. Theres supposed to be an illiquidity premium for investing in private markets, but apparently all theyve gotten is illiquidity and no premium. If they indexed instead, not only would they had done better, but they wouldve payed less fees in the process. Private markets and alternatives are the new hot thing on the street because now retail is gaining access to it. More money flooding in will probably mean that illiquidity premium youre supposed to get will be less. Also, net of fees youre probably right around public equities and maybe even less depending on the manager. Im not saying not to invest in it, just want you to be aware of some of the risks.

Reddit,2024-10-10,"David Swensen, who pioneered these alternatives approaches, much followed by the institutions you cite. Thought most people should be less actively involved and mostly should be watching their fees. Specifically, the access to private alternative funds is limited for the average retail investor AND those investments they can get to, have their earnings results eroded by excessive fees. The most important difference, in terms of categories of investors, is between those who can make highquality active management decisions and those who cant. Pioneering Portfolio Management is for those who have the ability to manage portfolios actively. Unconventional Success is a book for the overwhelming number of individual and institutional investors who cannot manage a portfolio actively. Almost everybody belongs on the passive end of the continuum. A very few belong on the active end. But the unfortunate fact is that an overwhelming number of investors find themselves betwixt and between. In that inbetween place, people end up paying high fees whether to a mutual fund or a stockbroker or another agent. And they end up with disappointing net returns. And, Im old enough to remember when most institutional investors didnt even have small cap or nonUS investments, let alone alternatives. So, small caps, nonUS, and emerging markets were, once, alternatives. Then high yield and global bonds were alternative. So, whats an alternative? Whatever wall street wants to package and sell you for a fee, regardless of return potential So, what do i invest in? PE?

Now as it affects investing theres a lot of money changing hands based on AI promises, so yes there is a bit of a bubble. But I believe there wont be a sudden burst of that bubble....so many companies have made significant investments into their AI infrastructures that theyll be able to pivot into more useful things when the truth about AI capabilities or lack thereof sets in. It wont just be a bunch of money lost, but they will have to redirect their resources. Yes, there are some acquisitions happening today including where I work that wont pan out in the end, so thats money lost but only for the acquirer, the equity owners of the acquired company have converted their equity into cash, which flows back into more investments, more companies, purchases in the economy, etc. So while I do believe theres a bit of overvaluation in the market based on AI hype, I dont think there will be a sudden bubble burst.

The answer The Sony a6400 camera has an electronic viewfinder EVF with a refresh rate of 60 frames per second fps. Further question can you do it on a6300? the answer Yes, the Sony a6300 does offer an option to increase the electronic viewfinder EVF refresh rate. You can choose between two refresh rates 60 fps default 120 fps high To change the EVF refresh rate on the a6300 Go to the Menu. Navigate to the Setup tab. Look for the option labeled FINDER FRAME RATE. You can select either Standard 60 fps or High 120 fps. The higher refresh rate of 120 fps provides a smoother experience, which can be beneficial for tracking fastmoving subjects. However, it may consume more battery power. Now whats the real answer? Taken from the review website The A6400 inherits the same 2.36 million dot OLED electronic viewfinder from the A6300, which features a 120fps high frame rate setting to help track moving subjects more smoothly with virtually no lag. Further communication I think you made a mistake, because A6400 features the same EVF as the a6300 and it seems thier refresh rates can be adjusted both to 120fps. ChatGPT fallows up Youre correct, and I apologize for the confusion. The Sony a6400, like the a6300, does indeed allow you to adjust the electronic viewfinder EVF refresh rate to either 60 fps or 120 fps. To adjust the EVF refresh rate on the a6400 Go to the Menu. Navigate to the Setup tab usually represented by a toolbox icon. Find the Finder Frame Rate option. Select either Standard 60 fps or High 120 fps. The 120 fps setting provides a smoother viewing experience, particularly useful for tracking fastmoving subjects. However, keep in mind that it might lead to increased battery consumption.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"So, heres my personal thought on this. And this is after watching an interview with the CEO of Google DeepMind Demis Hassabis In the short term, AI is overhyped because people are saying it will soon be able to do all these amazing things, and Hassabis says the same thing. AI is advancing quite quickly, with the next big thing being AI agents that can complete complex tasks for you, like an assistant. But thats not going to be in the short term, but moreso in the longer term. Im suspecting 45 years, personally. And that will be a big deal in terms of the tasks it can do for you. But we are not there yet. And this is similar to what Hassabis says, where longterm it may be underhyped but personally I think longer term it is just hyped. I think when companies are able to get AI agents to work, it will hit its stride. Want to also mention, that in an interview with Squawk Pod with Andy Jassy, the CEO of amazon he talked about AI, and the investments amazon is making on 3 major macro areas. One of them being for companies wanting to train their own AI models. And another for companies wanting to use existing models developed by other companies and amazon themselves. So, personally. I think we are still in the short term. Companies and developers are still learning about AI and how to make something concrete with it. Things like chatgpt and Gemini are amazingly impressive imo, but companies have not fully crystalized a way to monetize these tools and learn how to actually use them. Im looking longterm, and the companies investing in AI will benefit, assuming they make the right decisions on how to integrate with their business. But it will not be immediate, and it wont be an immediate spike in businesses but a gradual increase.",Positive,1,0.9057890772819519,Reply

And then make price projection based on those correlations. and get his app working, adapt to his visions and limited technical knowledge needed to make it happens.

What I see is ChatGPT understanding the assignment, putting the technical word on top of those simple words, sending function calls to other models gathering the necessary tools, information and structures needed so his application can be made by his own.

I have a lot of experience with AI in the visual defect detection space ironically, and there are good solutions there that existed before the AI hype cycle, but they were for very specific use cases where it was hard to tackle defects with traditional automated inspection tools. I shudder to think that the current trend is about ignoring the basics of inspection filtering, reference location, pattern matching, test construction, etc. which dont involve AI at all. AI is exciting research, but I think we are witnessing the breakdown in modern venture capitals investment ability to distinguish business problems and solutions. The risky financing behind technology has gotten out of control, and the ability to profit from it has become more about hype for a new technology than about profits or applicability to real world problems. It is a completely circular sales cycle where a technology generates hype, gets funded, and then the VCs are covered through financing offered by float from cloud service providers that see more volume in service consumption. It is all just a dance where we are running compute cycles for no reason except to prop up investment in a tech startup whose primary value is consuming more cloud services. AI is the final cycle of this because it gives you an excuse to consume a ton of resources to train these models, and not have to worry about the business effects of what these models can actually deliver until you are finished.

I fully believe you, but I also dont think youre thinking of your experience in the right way. When it comes to new tech, companies never wait until its 100 perfectly flawless before they put it in normie hands. This is because the data from your experience services development in a way that a lab environment cannot. I can compare it to a couple of different things. 1 Video game developers doing public betas for releases and consequential updates. There is basically an open admission from every type of software developer that they need widespread public usage data and feedback in order to effectively develop, and this is the most obvious, consumerunderstabdable example. Githubs baseline operating methodology is along the same lines. The thinking is that once they have a ton of anecdotal scenarios like yours, they can then fix the problems youre pointing out effectively, in a targeted manner. It is very difficult to anticipate your situation and develop against the possibility of that outcome in a lab setting without a time machine to work with. In video games case, theyre often assessing pixeltopixel interactions, so bots cant possibly give them the same data humans can. Does that mean theyre putting out an unfinished product at first? Sure, technically you could describe it that way. But its normal. 2 Chip readers at stores. Do you remember when the collective powers that be moved us from swiping to inserting, and later from inserting to tapping? Something no one feels the need to talk about is the fact that the newest method was always jank as hell for the first couple years of existing. There was a solid year of my life where 3 failed inserts followed by a swipe was my normal, every visit routine at the grocery store. I had no one to Karen at, and I never asked for this repetitive routine to be added to my life, but there it was, and if I wanted groceries I had to comply. I dont bother tapping yet because inserting once is finally working consistently, so Ill do that until they force me to switch methods again. Thats how all of this technology goes, and its how it will always go. Things will be released with issues so the public can provide the kind of broad feedback loop that simplifies the last chunk of development. Im not an AI investor, but youre using doomspeak to describe something completely normal in the software development world.

It is very clearly a powerful technology that has worldchanging ramifications but it may take a while before we figure out the best way to leverage it and create all the necessary groundwork. I dont think AI is overhyped. Actually, I think people largely dont appreciate its full potential. However, it could still be another decade or two before we fully reach that point. When we do, however, the world will be a very different place. It will be at least as large of a leap as the internet ushered in. If youre too young to remember needing to consult an encyclopedia or filling out an order form to mail away for something you may not fully appreciate the extent to which our lives have changed postinternet and you may not realize that it all started with a 2400bps dialup connection to ASCII message boards.

Now it can not only identify a cat it can nearly instantly generate an new image of an American Wirehair holding a sparkler while flying over Mt. Fuji in a wingsuit. My programming IDE autogenerates about 25 of my code out of thin air with zero effort on my part. These are HUGE leaps, and theyve occurred very quickly. The problem with AI is really just consistency. Something that fails 510 of the time isnt particularly useful in most cases even if the results most of the time are mindblowing. But that error rate will improve with additional training. More importantly, however, is that the learning algorithms are still being refined. Very soon we may be able to reduce the required training data sets by several orders of magnitude, for example. In the short term the AI bubble may or may not burst the way the dotcom bubble did.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"The fact that LLMs are trained on so may different fields of knowledge is part of what makes LLMs, to me, seem transformational. Recall that many of the breakthroughs in science and technology throughout history have come from combining disparate ideas from multiple disciplines and synthesizing something new. So the existing LLMs out there are very powerful tools. Full disclaimer I have a subscription to Claude.AI, and often use it as part of my work or for helping me learn. But my point was that while hardware will definitely improveand with improved hardware we may also see opportunities for improving softwareas you said, were reaching the asymptotic limit of what we can do with language and with a language model that essentially operates as a next word or next phrase predictor. And until we figure out a better theory of mind, what we got now is more or less it. That is, were going to have to shovel in more and more stuff in there for very small incremental improvements in intelligence. Its an amazing tool, and I do agree with you that it does have the power to transform our economyonce folks figure out the right ways to apply these tools. For me, I use it as a means to get some crossdisciplinary insight, which is fascinating. But as I noted before in my downvoted remarks LLMs are starting to reach an asymptote where the improvements are slowing down and becoming more incremental rather than fundamental. ... And it will require a fundamental rethinking of how AI works to move past where we are now. For example, Id love it if someone working on CoPilot would consider somehow marrying it with a toolset that can do dataflow analysis, semantic flow analysis and a method for onmachine code analysis such as variable usage as part of the underlying model. Meaning Id love it if CoPilot would not make stupid errors, like suggesting code that calls routines that are misnamed or that are guessed at, or calling out using variables that do not exist or are named differently.",Positive,1,0.9976798892021179,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-25,"Oh, I have no doubt GPUs will improve, and Im sure well see neurochips and other technologies roll out which make it possible to run large model LLMs on ever smaller and less energyintensive platforms. I personally would like to see the day when we can roll out a smallscale LLM that runs on a Teddy Ruxpinlike toy that can run enough of an LLM to hold sophisticated conversations with small children that can run off two Ccells. But from a software perspective the improvements were seeing in LLMs seem to be less fundamental and more incremental. In part, were simply hitting the limits of the philosophical theories of language and intelligenceor rather, the presumption that intelligence is strictly a linguistic construct rather than is based on an understanding of the world that is deeper than the symbols we attach to that meaning. Or, framed another way, LLMs currently do not have a model of the world or a model of how the world works essentially they predict the next word or collection of words that would go in a sentence as a response to an input collection of words. Its why there are so many examples of LLMs getting basic math wrong, or why we see things like CoPilot write shitty software because there is no understanding there. Just the manipulation of symbols. And the people currently working on the next generation of LLMs are essentially operating on the theory that if we could just shovel more shit in there, well get smarter LLMs. My own theory is that until we have a better theory of mind than the ideas from philosophical linguists, were only going to see very minor incremental improvements in what is already out there. Sure, itll be less energy intensive and eventually we may even see it run locally on portable devices. But it wont be smarter. And we already know that the way the human mind processes information is not just linguistic in nature. For example, at my alma mater, work was done to identify the clusters of neurons in the human brain that drive our ability to recognize faces. That is, you dont learn how to recognize faces after youre born from some sort of tabula rasa instead, there is builtin hardware inside the human brain which handles this recognition, and that there is a finite number of these clusters may go towards explaining why Dunbars number seems to exist.",Neutral,0,0.9620172679424286,Reply

Is the quality of life getting worse, of course not, like the rest of the world we take advantage of technology innovation and efficiency, but the US is no longer the best place to live for an average citizen. Were just not superior to the other top counties, as we used to be. Given the enormous size of our economy we should be. The examples of corporate welfare are plentiful. The biggest is healthcare. Consider that the biggest government expense is healthcare Medicare, Medicaid, VA, active service, ACA, employees, contractors employees, etc. The US federal government is the biggest buyer of healthcare in the world, but pays more per unit person, drug, etc than any other government. These prices could be negotiated down, but industry influence prevents that. FYI the Medicare drug negotiation that is much talked about today is a deception. The three drugs I checked all go off patent in 2026, the year the negotiated price comes into effect. In effect not costing big pharma anything. Eliquis, a drug used by someone I know, is more expensive in the US, the largest customer of it, than in any other country. The primary goals of ACA were two fold, lower prices and cover more people. More people are covered, but US prices continue to run wild. KFF, Kaiser Family Foundation has great studies of healthcare costs and effectively across the world. The US spends 34 times more for healthcare than the average of other developedrich nations. Other examples of government overpaying include military and even the broadband subsidies. The US pays 4 times more per fighter jet and Russia or China. It might be a better jet, but not so much better that one is more effective than three of theirs. The US has among the highest broadband Internet costs in the world. Too many poor and rural people cant afford the high cost. Rather than fostering competition to provide people options and keep prices down, the federal government just pays the overpriced broadband services from cable companies. This form of corporate welfare, overpaying, is not generally discussed, but it is bankrupting the US federal government and many citizens, and its making US based business operations and citizens less competitive in the global market. Know that this is not due to politicians not wanting to help constituents. This is due to the high likelihood that if they try to lower the ridiculously high prices Americans pay, theyll be fought with many millions of dollars the industry will spend in ads against them, funds to their opponents, etc. Its not the politicians that are the problem, its the system theyre in. And thats why changing the politicians changes little in real life. The real change is media. They make money off the big Republican vs Democrat distraction. And they make a ton of money running ads for the corporations who love that Americans government pay multiples more than other rich people whose governments they cant do readily manipulate. Can you imagine any of them reporting that their advertisers are screwing Americans with the by far the highest prices in the world? All the people, citizens, business leaders, politicians, etc are doing the best they can within the system we have. If you want a system thats great for corporations in spite of their whining for more more more youve got it in the US, just look at the US stock markets and corporate profitability. But if you want a system great for citizens and US based business operations, well the US needs some major reforms.",Neutral,0,0.9421971440315247,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-07,"I tell people this all the time, but your age and situation have a lot to do with it. If youre 25 and realistically just entered the workforce 23 years ago, youre going to be moving around and hopefully up in your career. No one stays at their first job for more than 23 years now and a lot of people are hopping around every 23 years especially early on for large pay raises and promotions. The issue with buying a house is it ties you down to a geographical location. Theres opportunity costs in only being able to accept positions within a reasonable commute to your house. For example, youre out job searching when its time for a moveupgrade and something paying a good 25 more with better benefits is on the other side of town and would make your commute jump from 3045 minutes to 1.5 hours each way. Do you take it? Suck it up? Try to sell the house and have to pay all the closing costs, moving, and other fees? If you were renting and more mobile, maybe its a 23 month fee and youre out, or perhaps youre cool with the landlord and theres no additional charge as long as you give a heads up of 12 months. Youre much more mobile. Point is, you buy a house when youre ready. Ideally with another person, like a wife or partner. Its bad enough we rent apartments as single people... buying a house single is even worse from a financial sense. All the expenses and upkeep are on you alone. Another financial thing to factor in are taxes and maintenancerepairs. Taxes are a lot these days and vary on area. Around here, taxes on a 300k house are actually more than our current rent. Taxes are essentially rent. so now youre paying a mortgage, have housing insurance, possibly PMI, interest to a bank... and youre paying rent taxes to the gooberment. Its expensive.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"As a 25 year old, should buying a house be my first priority as an investment? No. It should be your last priority. The opportunity cost is too high Housing appreciates at 4.3 annually, while other assets like stocks appreciate at more like 10 annually. Or if we want real value, assuming 3 inflation, thats like 1.26 vs 6.8. The difference over long timespans is absurd, and every dollar you put into a house is a dollar you arent putting into those higher returning assets. Over the course of a 30 year mortgage, you can expect a house to go about 3.5x in value. But you could expect an index fund to grow about 17.5x in value. The cost of leverage ie. mortgage is too high. When mortgage rates were below 4.3, then you could reasonably expect to offset the leverage expense with gains in house price. Now, youre losing money on the deal. And paying it off early is just reducing leverage, so youre just transferring your losses from mortgage interest to losses from opportunity cost. The cost of ownership is probably higher than you think property tax, HOA, maintenance, home insurance, closing costs, etc.. Generally you save a lot by renting. The benefits from fixed mortgages tend to come in the second half of the mortgage, but taking a financial bath for 15 years is generally too big of a deficit to overcome, especially given current mortgage rates. Youre still at an age where you might move.... repeatedly. You can likely be more happy with renting a lessnice apartment than buying a lessnice house, because your commitment is generally only about a year. Which means you can save a lot more than even an apples to apples comparison. TLDR You should put off buying a home as long as possible and throw everything you can towards higher paying assets. Buying a home is fundamentally a conservative choice, and your risk appetite at age 25 should be much too high for buying a home. When to buy a home? Married with children. Nearing retirement and want to reduce risk profile Nonfinancial reasons, like you cant stand one more minute living in an apartment. You think youre living in an area that will absolutely explode in value, like Seattle 30 years ago. Theres some localized and temporary thing going on and buying is significantly cheaper than renting for some reason. Ballpark, 20 years rent is usually close to the price to buy. In some dying town, maybe its 10 years... but in a dying town, you probably wont get normal appreciation in home prices. But if for some reason there was an extreme but shortterm few years renting shortage, then maybe itd make sense.

You also buy less junk over time lol. To your point on immigration With millions of illegal entries into the US, as well as in most European countries, there will be tax implications on legal residents and citizens to help pay for services used by those migrants. For example, one major food manufacturer hired thousands of African migrants because they wanted to work. Many of those individuals asked more hours, their wages were lower, sure, but their numbers are substantial. Huge cost savings. There are news articles on this specific manufacturer, in the meat industry. Those migrants, who abide by the host nations laws and cultural norms, versus trying to protest against it or attempt to change it, are working jobs most host nation people do not want from my perspective. Other examples of tax implications California, Illinois, and New York use tax dollars to provide free housing, other services, and monthly income to many migrants. In other words, legal residents and citizens will see their tax dollars diverted to similar social policies that does not offer a direct benefit to those paying the bill. Worse, to sustain a social policy of that nature, with a growing migrant population and the challenges brought with that population as these migrants come from all walks of life and not everyone is vetted, requires tax increases.

There is also plenty of housing supply, there are simply not very many people with the skills or capital to fix the affordable housesnot enough people currently willing to adjust and move to a more rural area where housing is far cheaper than a metro area. I think there is a smaller subset of homeowners that simply cant wait to sell for whatever financial reason so they look to corporate buyers. The housing bubble is real, but its propped up by people who are willing to take insane mortgage agreements, including corporate buyers who are shooting themselves in the foot just like everyone else. All it takes is more people willing to hold out and let a few more banks fail so the remaining ones panic and create competitive pricing as a result. The Fed obviously isnt too perturbed by this or we would have seen rate cuts already.

I think the biggest issue is that everyone is too busy trying to carve out some exclusive skillset that pays 6 figures or more instead of going into a trade or another essential labor task within society.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"The two biggest priorities are emergency savings and retirement. Whether you get to retirement by owning a home or not frankly does not matter. The only thing that matters is not running out of money before you die. If you rent for the rest of your life but get a lifestyle you want, who cares that its not your name on the home? And as a home owner let me tell you that renting is significantly more convenient. Owning a home is historically not going to be as great of an investment as stocks, and this is especially true if you consider the ability to use tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and if your employer does matching. Id definitely recommend maxing your IRA401k first as the most efficient strategy. However if like many others you like the idea of owning a home then theres nothing wrong with saving for that.

But the point of home ownership is completely eliminating the cost of housing when youre retired. House prices wont ever fall. They will only go up as the population increases and as people get older, because successive govts arent bothered enough about building more. Even if there are mass home building programs, were so far gone at this point that it would have to be extremely radical. Think to yourself Would you really take the gamble of paying god knows how much in rent 50 years from now until the day you die? In 30 years, you could have already paid off that mortgage. That means a whole fuck tonne more disposable income during your prime earning years. If you buy a house, the savings will be stark within 10 years. Youll notice how all your friends stuck renting will be paying more than you pay for your mortgage, and that difference will only become more stark over time.

This lets you amortize the closing costs over a decent period You can house hack, where you rent out some portion of the house to cover your housing costs You can house hop, where you buy a run down house and bring it back to move in ready so its more marketable. Then sell and do again with a different house. This is effectively a second job that you can do at your own pace. Just make sure you are careful to do it right so it actually adds value. Generally you can only gain the difference in value between what is was vs the upgrade I.e you have to live with something unusable until you replace it Also the general formula for cost is Interest payment Taxes Maintenance Closing Costs to Buy Closing Costs to Sellyears of ownership Opportunity Cost on invested principal Appreciation Equity invested The years helps spread closing costs and lower amount of equity improves how much effective ROI you have from appreciation. Principal paid is not a cost since you keep that money, but it does have an opportunity cost could have been invested elsewhere. People compare mortgage to rent, but its not that simple. You need to do the math for your situation. Personal story We house hopped on a run down rental that someone offloaded. Ripped everything out kitchen, bathrooms, flooring and replaced.

Because thats how they get deals done, so they can get paid. Either way, never go into a bank for a mortgage. Because youll end up paying more for it than you need to. The ONLY time I would buy retail is maybe a new construction home with a promo rate mortgage from their inhouse people that has been heavily bought down. As far as the future? Youre gonna be fine.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Houses are not inherintly difficult to build on mass to keep up with demand. The issue lies in the legal and consent side, you need permission from the government to build a house or buy a plot.

Combined with zoning rules, material and architectural form requirements as per the neighbourhood district requirements, the area youre building, wealth or racial cock blocking you can only build houses at a certain minimum value in some areas, or an immigrant or minority cant develop an area because theyre a minority, etc. These parameters just add more layers. Some people have the funds to certainly build a house, but the costs and consents can be astronomical. Sometimes its for safety, like construction site safety and management. Safety does increase cost no doubt. Sometimes its due to speculation. Housing markets in cities in NZ, aussie, Canada, US, UK and most western euro countries, China in its major cities are inflated severely because housing is used as an investment vehicle rather than just a survival commodity. Forget about all the road blocks and points you mentioned, it wont change your decision.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Hi, 24yo m that bought a house at 23, heres some thoughts and what Id recommend. Houses in long run have proven to be good investments, so it is likely a solid financial decision to buy. With that said, they are a highmaintenance investment compared to something like stocks. ACs break, pipes burst, etc. These are all things that lower your roi, and are a pain in the bum. It is undoubtedly true that building equity is better than paying rent tho. Heres how I approached the problem I wanted a house so I could make more money in the long run, so I went out and looked for nice houses with many bedrooms. I made up a metric that was costbedroom, and tried to lower that as much as possible without sacrificing on quality of home. After I bought the house, I moved my friends in with me and they pay me rent. 4 of us in the house 4 bedrooms, I personally pay about 50month of my mortgage out of pocket. Obvi this is good because my cash flow situation is great, but there is risk with this. If my roommates were to leave, I would be on the hook for the full mortgage which is not cheap. The way to minimize this risk is to do a test of ur worst case scenario no roommates, how much are u spending every month in ur budget vs how much do u make. If u can afford to make all the payments and still eat, then ur prob ok. Having this extra income obvi helps in case u lose ur job or something too. Another thing about home ownership is the mortgage interest is tax deductible, so you may get a bit of a refund during tax season depending on ur situation, but if u are collecting rent u will have to pay taxes on that so be careful. obvi liquidity sucks compared to stocks, and u may have to increase size of ur emergency fund if mortgage is what u would pay for rent or something. as for the house itself, try to buy a nice house in a good location ik easier said than done lol but nice placeshomes tend to hold their value and are less volatile. youll have a very hard time selling a house if ur neighborhood sucks. look for a catalyst that will make ur home value go up. For me, I noticed a new homeless shelter was donated by rich people and is being built on other side of town. I live near current shelter, so if I own long enough eventually neighborhood becomes nicer when homeless population is relocated. Your location is of importance in this calculation, especially the housing supply in said location. I wouldnt buy in an area where tons of homes are being built, high supply equal low demand and prices. Its better to go to a neighborhood where all the houses are being fixed up full neighborhood finite supply than it is to go to a new neighborhood supply of houses increasing. last thing, I may be wrong about this dont buy a cookie cutter house. Ifwhen u go to sell it, you will likely be competing against other sellers that have the same house as you, and u will have to get into a price war to sell. Try to buy something unique again, lowers supply. lastly, your age is of concern. If u are young, there is a chance youll get a new job that will relocate you to a new city, and then your house could become a bit of a problem to maintain this is my current predicament. you can sell not what I want to do rn, get a property manager, expensive, I think only really good ones are worth it or try to maintain it yourself time consuming. If u are married andor have kids, I think buying a house makes more sense, for life reasons and because u are more likely to stay in ur city. sorry for rant hope this helps, pls lmk if any questions.",Neutral,0,0.9667463898658752,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-07,"I strongly advise you to prepare to buy a house. Be modest in what you choose initially, and make sure you can comfortably afford it on an emergency salary whatever you think the floor of your earning potential is. I also recommend new construction so you have a fresh timer on things breaking due to age, plus a 1 year warranty for any nearterm issues. There are some astonishingly ignorant comments that suggest renting is better, but that wont set you up for success longterm. I watched my family rent for 30 years and they still dont own a house at retirement age. That means that even if they had saved properly which they didnt, they guaranteed themselves higher expenses in their old age. Not to mention that they paid someone elses mortgage and more during that 30 years, while the owner got their mortgage paid profit. I bought a house in 2020 smart and lucky and now pay 400 less on a mortgage for a 3 bedroom house than I paid for rent on a 1 bedroom apartment. Im up 100k in equity, and Ill never have to worry about rent getting raised or the owner deciding to sell. My payments will only shrink as I pay down the principal. If I lose my job and Im worried about money, I can rent a room to help offset the cost. If I move, I can rent or sell. Rates drop lower than what Im paying? Refinance. Major repair? Its absorbed by equity and my increased savingsinvestment ability. Meanwhile, I still have money to save, invest, travel, etc. Even more than if I was renting due to the cost difference. Also, this works with current rates too. Just depends where and what you buy. Theres a reason the American any many other nationalities dream includes owning a house. No one scrimps, saves, and slaves at their job with the goal of renting until they die. When you buy is up to you, but thats your best bet for longterm stability and financial agility.

When you find a place you like as a renter, the landlord has the right to increase the cost of rent every year. Unless you want to keep moving your monthly expenses are going to keep going up. Finding a home you love that you can afford can be challenging. I found one in LA back in 2004 and everyone said it was impossible. The home needed repairs but I got these done for under 10K and had a nice, relatively cheap place to live. My equity in my home doubled in 6 months. Fast forward to 2016 when I tried to buy something in a Southern state. I thought this would be simple as prices were cheaper and there was more inventory. It was still tough and the inventory was bought up quickly. I persisted and found a home I could afford. The mortgage was less than my rent in my crummy apartment. The value of my home went up 50 and keeps increasing. It is a matter of deciding what you want to buy, working out what you can afford, and then looking, looking, looking until you find your place.

I learned about rental contracts and finding roommates on Craigslist still creepy then lol. I bought my first house with my brother and eventually learned how to manage it when we both moved out him out of state. I found a great property manager company and still have the same tenants almost 13 years later. I learned what cash out refinance was and was able to leverage that to continue to build out my portfolio. Also the importance of diversification. Anyways you have so much opportunity for big risks that if a property thats right for you pops up...he should get it with the hopes of subletting and experience...if the numbers work out.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"I would never say buying a house is the best investment, I believe the decision is much more nuanced. The decision is frankly not a purely financial one. The math with current interest rates _is_ likely on the side of renting home ownership, but this isnt always the case. My point is that its not quite as cut and dry as Buying a house is exactly the same cost or more expensive than renting over time except that youre locked into a house and cant move freely and can save more money. It is extremely dependent on current interest rates, _where_ you are looking to buy a house, and if you find value outside of pure monetary value in the house itself, how long the term of your mortgage is, etc. etc. For the OP in this thread, I think the answer to should buying a house be my first priority as an investment? is a pretty clear No. Perhaps buying a house should be a first priority in life if thats what brings you joy or comfort, but purely as an investment, no, just shove it in the SP 500 index funds and chill.",Neutral,0,0.9998067021369934,Reply

My mortgage is 4500 a month utilities, after you factor in property taxes and maintenance it equals out around the same. The only difference was my down payment.

This is a 37 discount to NAV! In previous high season in the uranium sector that discount to NAV was 15. We are now in the first month of the new high season. In the meantime Nexgen Energy NXE is a large cap where most investors go to when they hear about the uranium sector. NXE share price will increase together with the other uranium company stocks.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"Guys, if you are new to this sector, please read this message as a bit of advice from someone who has been in this investment since 2019. It is a volatile sector. Expect big drops of 20 in mid cap stocks and even more in small caps. Within a week. This happens also for the upside like we see this month for a lot of the U equities. That said, there is unbelievable valuation and immense upside to many uranium juniors and business focused on the fuel cycle enrichment etc. This sector moves at a glacial speed, and many stocks do get ahead of themselves. Do lots of homework on companies that are developers of mines. The only producers that need to be considered for a newbie is Cameco, Uranium energy Corp, boss energy and energy fuels. If you want more then look at Sprotts Uranium information on their website. Dont listen to hype on YouTube, X, and other sources. Its a great opportunity to buy a non fungible, scarce and undervalued commodity, but dont expect to make life changing money if you consider yourself an average investor, much of the easy money has been made already in the sitting and waiting. Now is the time to look for value, performance and the companies that are actually going to be able to mine this resources at significant quantities well into the future.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"The uranium market is already seeing a mix of tight supply and rising demand for nuclear energy, especially as countries push for clean energy solutions. Kazakhstans recent production cuts and the U.S. banning Russianenriched uranium are only going to add more pressure to an already constrained market. On top of that, demand for uranium is expected to grow as China and other nations continue to build nuclear reactors. Prices have been fluctuating, but many experts believe they will rise again due to these supply and demand dynamics. Whats also interesting is how big tech companies are now getting involved. Microsoft recently signed a deal to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power its data centers, while Oracle is building small modular reactors SMRs to fuel its AI data centers. These reactors are expected to deliver over 1 gigawatt of electricity, showing just how critical energy demand has become in powering AI growth.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"Speaking as an exploration geologist, uranium prospects are definitely getting interest in some weird places. Most of the shortterm money is going to be made by individuals and juniors making claims and working them into good prospects to sell to majors or create a JV. Basically, folks in the industry. Some majors are doing exploration, but Im usually not impressed with their ability to attract and retain top talent needed for good greenfields exploration Theres a reason why geologists work contract to contract. Personally, Im more excited by DoE funded research on converting tailings. All of your cost is in processing ore thats already dug up, and the potential for government funding is huge if you can clean up an area with historic minerelated hazards. Whoever is able to get that first contract in with clear buyin from the government and a new processing technique will cause a new gold rush.",Positive,1,0.7615293264389038,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-16,"Still waiting for liquid fluoride thorium reactor LFTR to come online. These can convert Thorium232 into Thorium233. This decays into Protactinium233, which further decays into Uranium233. Protactinium233 can be removed from the liquid salt of a tworegion MSR by reductive extraction into liquid bismuth. Basically a breeder reactor that uses a cheaper and more abundant fuel source. This style of reactor was designed in the 1950s and I honestly believe the main reason this hasnt been developed further is more due to proliferation risks than cost or feasibility. Since the Protactinium233 can be extracted rather easily and would be of high concentration, it would reduce a lot of the work needed to make a nuclear weapon. Mainly removal of neutron emitters and other purification steps to get to 95 purity of Uranium233. Uranium233 is a fissile isotope.",Neutral,0,0.9932193160057068,Reply

Sure theres a nuclear renaissance currently ongoing but micro reactors are micro e.g. small meaning less required fuel and many are far from being deployed in the coming years.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"TL,DR from ChatGPT Summary Uranium Market Report Price Trends Since 2020, uranium prices have surged from 21lb to 106lb in February 2024, currently stabilizing at 83lb. The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected. Uranium Overview Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U238 used in military applications and U235 used to fuel nuclear reactors. U235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal. HALEU and Enrichment Highassay lowenriched uranium HALEU is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives. Supply Challenges Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 1015 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30 by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap. Demand Growth The U.S., China, and France account for 58 of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28 increase in demand from 20232030 and a 51 rise from 20312040, driven by global clean energy goals. Global Production Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43 of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward selfreliance. Investment Insights The report suggests that mining companies are wellpositioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector. Conclusion The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uraniums role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.

Reddit,2024-10-16,Its not about disagreeing. Its about being a better solution. Even in the winter solar just wont even generate enough energy nor will wind. And if we create enough windmills to have enough energy in the winter then theyll be sitting on their arses whole summer. It is not a solution for baseline energy it is a complementary solution to the baseline. Then you fill in with renewables and batteries which can also charge from overproduction of a nuclear facility. Furthermore I think energy production should be more decentralized which reduces the scale of some energy plants and makes it more cost effective. See SMR which china is already starting production of. If we can streamline and make the production of it more efficient itll probably even cost less money than all other energy sources.,Positive,1,0.9504442811012268,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-08,"The income that I live off of comes from trading in the stock market that I do using leverage collateralized by my savings. If I instead put those savings into a house, I lose that collateral and therefore my ability to trade on margin. So, Id have to start working normal hours again to replace that income source. Its just the nature of the Los Angeles real estate market, the buy vs rent equation always depends on the specific market youre in. Where I live, you simply cant just put 20 down and expect to get a mortgage that costs the same as what the rent for that place would be. So my options would be assuming I want to maintain my current standard of living or at least close to it 1 Go back to work while still maintaining my current trading activities in order to double my income, then put 20 down on a condohouse and get a mortgage which with current interest rates is going to be almost double my current rent for the rest. Or 2 Buy a condohouse in cash using all of my savings, and go back to work to fund all of my other expenses and build back up some savings. Either way, Id have to go back to working full time and I have additional financial concerns with both options on top of that.

Taiwanese people are pretty united against China at this point look at how long it has been since the KMT won an election. An amphibious invasion across a rough strait is not easy for any military.

So the US will have to make a choice stand by its principles and show the world it can be relied on in times of need, or chicken out and sell it as Murica Furst. In the former case, the US economy will take a serious blow instantly but probably recovers relatively fast, as soon as alternatives are in place, while in the second case the US economy will take a long term serious blow as lots of strategic partners and allies will back off. Nothing is as bad as an unreliable trade partner who betrays its allies and partners.

Reddit,2024-10-05,"The main importe from Russia were oil and gas, though also uranium and a number of other raw materials. Europe had a huge spike in electricity, gas, and oil prices that its still dealing with today, though between increased US production, a lot more LNG infrastructure, and buying more from places like Azerbaijan hence their feeling empowered to kick Armenians out of their country. The West really did incur a significant cost in moving mountains to completely cut off imports from Russia. And other buyers are finding it more difficult to get those goods no gas pipelines to China currently, Western insurance companies wont insure Russian oil tankers, etc and are also receiving huge discounts because Russia has few buyers. Its probably not possible to cut off China as much as Russia was, but there are all sorts of levers that the OECD has available, and the counties most affected likely Japan and South Korea are heavily incentivized to bear the cost of cutting off China, just like Poland, Germany, the Baltic countries, and others were to cut off Russia. The Chinese economy is currently very fragile, and its political system is very brittle, so it wouldnt take a lot to send the country into crisis. China has been buzzing Taiwan with planes for years, and definitely could bomb them back to the Stone Age, but theyve refrained from doing so. What would it gain from leveling Taipei vs what would the world reaction be to a major world city being obliterated?

E.g., taking an island here or there and literally claiming almost the entire South China Sea and militarily fortifying it with dozens of strategically placed artificial islands. You underestimate how scary Xi is because unlikely his predecessors, he has shown to be willing to tank Chinas economy for ideological e.g., Covid lockdowns a full 18months after everywhere else in the world stopped or political e.g., support Russia in their Ukrainian War purposes. And furthermore, unlike his predecessors, he has almost complete control of the CCP by wiping out nearly everyone that does not support him even exPresident Hu got very publicly and unceremonially removed. And militarily, I doubt there is any active US general that would bet Taiwan winning over a Chinese invasion without significant and lightningfast US and Japanese naval and air support. The Ukraine War has shown the significant deficiencies with Western Arms e.g., precision missiles that are extremely expensive and slow to produce with maybe a month of stockpiles. With an authoritarian government, you just need to outlast a democracyrepublic based one. Look at the Ukraine War lots of support initially that is slowly but steadily dwindling.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"I read your entire post including all the links. I didnt listen to the podcast tho. But regardless this is more than most likely did. The fundamental problem with your thesis here is your making a macro call and then trying to apply it to a discrete event occurring very shortly. Even if we agreed that theres power concerns, fiscal concerns, concerns with the overall model of AI, concerns about chip manufacturing and ability Its unlikely any of that is on the ballot on the 28th. Whats going to be the concern is revenues for this quarter hitting towards the top end of expectations or exceeding it and then projections for the upcoming quarters Now maybe some of those issues feed into projections but I sort of doubt it. These are longer term problems, so Id be more willing to bet they become an issue over the next 6 to 18 months rather than in 3 days. So its a pretty regarded take to make based on the thesis.

But hopefully by next year we some competition. Just think about intel and AMD they both have gpus capable of processing llms and generative ai but for a little bit less than a flagship retail nvidia card you dont get much of the performance so you might as well buy a equally priced nvidia card. They perform far worst and there are not many libraries available so now you create two problems . The lack of support from libraries creates a difficult where you gonna have to either write your own library which requires time and resources from engineers or use the libraries that are already available but you have to jump through so many hoops to make it work and guess less performance that now you wasted time and money . Lets say you try to hire the top of line engineer most of them already have experience with CUDA , if not its easy enough to learn but if you go anywhere else and try to build in house now you gotta add the time to develop and optimize the library to work as good as a CUDA GPU .

That small slice of the market they can replace currently is worth hundreds of billions, and if they continue to make those linear gains they can replace many trillions. Thats very significant even if it isnt the end all be all. The reason companies continue to buy nvidia is that currently the economics of it are more efficient than labor. Labor is extremely inefficient so its an easy milestone to cross. Think of the buildings and infrastructure and management required for staff. Then there is all the cars driven to work, all the ACs turned on. All of that is the price of labor and its a lot more than just a salary.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"Buy post puts or gtfo. I read 1 paragraph of the DD before giving up. But GPT read and responded in 5seconds The critique youve provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AIs current trajectory and potential. 1. AI Approaches and Progress The critique dismisses the GPTML approach as a known dead end, but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While its true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fictionlike fantasies e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S., this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT3, GPT4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries. 2. Exponential Investment for Linear Gains The notion of exponential investment for linear gains is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of whats possible. 3. Business Case for AI The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an allencompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decisionmaking, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable. 4. Training Data and Resources Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resourceintensive nature of AI. 5. Nvidias Role While its true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust softwarehardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidias role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete. 6. Investor Expectations The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and longterm potential. In summary, while AIs development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a bubble fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock.",Positive,2,0.8755164742469788,Reply

Datacenters seem inefficient and costly, but the amount of work they do is tremendous and replaces far far far more energy worth of human labor than they cost. For a chatbot, GPT 4os pricing is now within 10x of simply hiring a guy in The Philipines.

Its kind of like the Tesla story a couple years ago. Company hits scale in a new market, competition emerges and issues start to crop up, so theres a limit to growth upside. But valuations are assuming fairly substantial continued growth. So the upside is minimal and downside risks are elevated.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"Because they are investing in the next wave of labor replacements for the said trillions of future revenue? It turns out you need to invest now to see revenue later. You are also wrong about improvement costs being completely exponential. That is true for the scaling wide increasing parameter count and training time, but scaling vertically is much more efficient. I use the latest models every day for programming and it seems like every week theres something new that can solve some problems the previous model couldnt solve. The current state of the art is focused on improving training and making a corpus of training data have better results. The gains are spectacular. Microsofts Phi 3.5 mini came out last week and has 3.8B parameters. It outperforms Llama 2 70B from a year ago on benchmarks. Thats almost 20x less parameters and possibly training time. They did this by improving training methodology and making training data higher quality. So methodology is leading to huge improvements. Hyper scale companies are continuing to scale wide AND implement these methodologies. This means each generation is getting better and better and we have a while before we get to scraping the bottom of the barrel of the gains.",Positive,1,0.9999949932098389,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-25,"The Jarvis is ridiculous only sounds silly if youve started paying attention to this in the last year or two. You can look up what folks like Sam Altman were saying 5 years ago. Here he is in 2019 openly saying they have no real path to profitability and once we make AI good enough itll just tell us how to make a return. A year ago the entire field was bristling with excitement about AGI and superintelligence, its a relatively recent development that theyve walked expectations back. Theyre just doing the fusion power is 5 years away thing. Heres Sam himself talking down GPT4 2 months before it came out and a couple months ago saying its mildly embarrassing at best and heres him saying largely the same thing nearly 6 years ago The current thing is always good enough for some tasks and the true AGI future is just a few years away. The issue isnt that it takes time, the issue is in 2020 when they released GPT3 theyd raised less than 100m, and today theyve raised over 13B, and they dont have a lot to show for that extra 12.9B. Sams talking about burning 50 billion a year to build AGI and its just got people wondering how many rounds well have to go on this before we get whats actually promised. At the end of the day its not his 50 billion to burn, his company isnt profitable so its gotta come from other people who arent going to keep ponying up if theres no progress to show for it. Obviously the AI sector is bigger than OpenAI, but theyre the best example. True AGI would be worth near infinite investment, but 400B for the current state of AI wasnt worth it, the longer this goes the more investors will just see it as throwing good money after bad.",Neutral,0,0.9973278045654297,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-20,"NVMI is headquartered in Rehovat, Israel, which was built on the depopulated ruins of the ancient village of Zernuqa. Its like buying a company built on a Native American burial ground. Your calls will be cursed. According to Wikipedia Zarnuqa was depopulated on 2728 May by the Givati Brigade during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War. One account in Al HaMishmar described how a soldier fired with a Sten gun at three people one old man, old woman and a child and how the villagers were taken out from the houses and had to stay in the sun, in hunger and thirst, until they surrendered the weapons they claimed they did not have. They were then expelled towards Yibna. In total, six died and 22 were taken prisoners. The day after, the inhabitants returned and recounted that the Yibna villagers saw them as traitors. The Zarnuqa villagers saw their village being ransacked by Jewish soldiers and nearby settlers. They were expelled again and the houses were demolished the month after.32 The family of the Shaqaqi brothers, Fathi one of the founders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the political scientist Khalil Ibrahim, was from Zarnuqa.33 They fled in the face of rumours of massacres of Palestinians by Yishuv troops and expected to return after the hostilities ended. They were not permitted to come back.5 Haidar Eid, Associate Professor at alAqsa University in Gaza, states that his parent were evicted from the village by members of the Haganah and Stern gang who told them Leave your homes or we will kill and rape you.34",Neutral,0,0.999977707862854,Reply
