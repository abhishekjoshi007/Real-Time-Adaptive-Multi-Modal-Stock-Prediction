Microsoft has started throwing shady ads for its AI on my login screens and comes up with feature like what if we just grabbed screenshots of your PC at random. Meta is.... well, called Meta now despite the utter failure of the Metaverse, and I interact with its products as little as I can. Netflix got its content carved up when everyone else started their own streaming services and then cracked down on account sharing. Apple... does what I need it to do. I got AirPods for the first time a while ago, and I was blown away by how convenient they were compared to most Bluetooth tech and the noise canceling was surprisingly good. I got a new iPhone recently, and I set it next to my old one and all my settings and info transferred over automatically. The most recent annoyance Ive had with an Apple product is... removing the headphone jack? So, a complaint from like a decade ago. Boeing looked good on paper for a long time. Boeing is on fire right now because they werent making a quality product. Say what you will about the relative financial side of the companies, or even the priceperformance, but I dont think anyone would say Apple isnt making quality products."

Maybe not Tesla, but someone. 2. Tesla is the only company making a profit selling EVs in the US today. The only company close to Tesla is Ford You can tell because nobody else is brave enough to split out EV profit and loss on their reports. Also, Tesla is still selling EVs credits to other companies. Due to their low cost of sales, Tesla can just keep walking the price down and force everyone else except maybe Ford to either 1. Take a loss on each EV sold 2. Stop selling EVs Tesla might be overvalued today, but you cant determine that by comparing it to GM, Stellantis, VWAG, BMW, Honda, Toyota, etc. Many of those names will either go bankrupt or merge and become a shallow husk of their former selves because they simply arent skating to where the puck will be.

They havent been bringing more money in, or appreciably growing any of its businesses. Their products are profitable, but its not correct to say they are growing. Instead, Tesla has been cutting costs significantly to offset this lack of growth, as well as getting significant carbon offset credits. The issue is the former is a temporary measure, at best, to increase the short term profits, but has severe consequences downline as you May ah be left without the staff to grow at all. The second is a concern because this isnt a sustainable product. Im not knocking him for using them, but a pretty significant portion of the profits this quarter are roughly 13 are purely from an unsustainable source. This is not good news for the future. For all intents and purposes, Tesla is looking to sell just as many vehicles this year as last year, and revenue only marginally better. They are.increasing profits, but this is likely due to cutting costs through labor and the like, which can have severe downline impacts on growth. In short, as of right now, there is no reason to claim Tesla is a growth company. Its barely growing. Its finding creative ways to increase profits on its revenue, but this is sustainable for only so long."

Well, theres Apple and theres Android. At least in the US, the market has spoken, and more people prefer Apples higherpriced curated ecosystem where the watch complements the phone complements the headphones compliments the computer, and they get some nice recurring revenue from services sold on top of it all. The thing about an ecosystem of products is that it enables you to charge higher margins. Teslas app lets you see the status of your car and your solar panels and your home battery... but only if you buy each one from Tesla.

Its a small thing but thats stuff that matters to people. Small conveniences add up. Similarly people want their home battery system to just work and not bother them with details. They want their car charged intelligently when the price of power is lowest. Actually no one wants a car in the first place. What you want is mobility and possibly the occasional transport capacity. A car is just a necessary evil to have that. If people could get from A to B without any effort like annual service checkups or getting gas or all the big and small things you have to do to keep your car in shape at the same price point they would. This is e.g. the idea behind robotaxi. The future market for battery storage is huge. Like in the automobile market theres room for several players with very healthy margins while demand far outpaces supply. So for the next couple years I wouldnt worry about Tesla not being able to scale sales numbers and sell their packs at a very nice asking price last I checked they were already sold out for the next two years or so. While demand is high there is no also reason for Samsung to offer theirs cheaper. If you sell everything you can push out the factory door you try and get the highest price you can. You only need to underbid a competior if theres actual competition going on. This is something people missed about the early EV market.

This thread also goes into all the reasons why AI has disappointed while talking about beneficiaries it doesnt seem like youre that confident in the ability to deliver on the end products when it comes to AI. 2 I think the timing is very difficult. I dont disagree with what youre saying in regards to spending and Ill admit that I thought this cycle would be a giant version of smaller previous NVDA cycles and it still probably will, but on a longermuch longer time frame than Id expected. Yes, mega cap tech is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on this. No, shareholders dont really care yet and what does it take to change so many peoples one investment playbook from basically own mega cap tech? I dont know and to try and predict thatcall the top because one thinks its an eventuality without any indications of things starting to erode is going to lead to disappointment. So, I dont disagree with some of the things you mention but the specifics are tough I do think that theres an interesting conversation about AI beneficiaries. I talked about VST early this year on here as an AI beneficiary and the response was crickets because it was like nobody wanted to hear anything AIrelated that wasnt tech. Mag 7 have had a good year, but things that are beneficiaries of all that spending NVDA primarily, but things like VRT have had a better year imo. I mean, two of the top performing stocks this year are utilities that have mooned because of expected energy demand. I think that there are potentially interesting discussions on peoples guesses for beneficiaries in terms of productivity and theres not enough discussion on here of whats being impacted call center software FIVN clearly not a beneficiary. ADBE is struggling. Jumping into something like small cap value may be a better investment starting soon although theres nothing that I can see that would indicate that or the way things are going this could easily go on for another couple of years."

After all this cant be about the Sanofi vaccine in combination with MatrixM, because that wouldnt require any work. But they never responded. They are probably too busy firing scientists and making plans for the new pipeline. Novavax continues to optimize preclinical candidates, including a new approach to H5N1 bird flu vaccination. Novavax also confirmed earlier in the month that its currently conducting a preclinical study for an avian flu shot Novavax, which has been conducting preclinical tests on vaccines targeting three different H5N1 strains, rose 5.3 per cent to 15.70. In a prepared statement, Novavax told the Financial Times that its vaccine platform could be an attractive asset from a pandemic preparedness perspective because the currently available avian influenza vaccines produce limited immune response."

That said, I found IBM to be a kind of cult to many customers in the 80s and 90s, and a few even now. At first, enterprises looked at IBM as the Cadillac of computing. They locked in many places with their mainframe computing the IBM 360 was a staple of business. The biggest places had sales staff with personal relations to the C level of enterprises and sole sourced the equipment. UNIVAC, DEC, Tandem and others to a lesser extent. As the 80s and 90s rolled around, Big Blue kept high prices on their Cadillac and although they rolled out their UNIX AIX and virtually invented the PC, the pricing was high, proprietary in an open source minded world and they lost market share. For one retail company, the Bd of Directors required competitive bidding, and even though any competitor could provide less price and equal or superior function, IBM would be awarded the work because we are used to them. Finally others stopped bidding the pointless exercise it was just to press IBM to keep their pricing down. When the old guard retired, and the enterprise realized the premium they paid for obsolete proprietary systems it was too late. They still used the IBM OS2 PC into the 2000s. They went from sales of billions to bankruptcy. I am convinced their cult belief in IBM and failure to modernize contributed. I did a study for multiple companies that illustrated if they moved off the bloated AIX systems to competitive systems, they would save millions. The paradigm shift always seemed risky, but those that moved were well rewarded. In the last 15 years, where IBM competed against Dell, HPHPE, Fujitsu, Amazon, Microsoft and others for data center refresh, cloud and other updates, they rarely stood the test, unless it was from one of those cultist enterprises who had decided before the bid. They still have a mainframe market it is expensive to migrate but not impossible. Their database product , PC, AIX and others are considered by most to be old iron. Even their cloud is a bit proprietary and pricey iron cloud. Watson has been discussed Their quantum computing research is admirable but given their history of trying to make things proprietary so they can keep price and margin high, I wont expect it to play well with others. It is vaporware somewhat. All said, their sales and margins and employee count are down to 23 of the numbers 10 years ago. The legacy of arrogance. I vote thumbs down. FWIW."

With each tech bubble that weve seen over the last 30 years, I was able to gain roughly 10x increase in net worth after all forms of income and gains gets added up. I truly believe that my next 10x increase to come from AI. I would say, if these companies are just creating value for shareholders then Im one of those shareholders thats benefiting from them. I wasnt even very aggressive in my investments. I was just playing along at home and just about anyone else can as well. Paying attention to the industry and know a bit about the technology behind the hype, I think its fairly easy to spot when things are slowing down and about to turning sour, so youd be able to start to slowly withdraw from those investments and park your money elsewhere thats safer. Right now, I dont think AI is anywhere near its peak. Yes, AI is premature and we dont know where itll end up or how people will be making money from it, but its also far too premature to be worried about the bubble bursting. Just let it ride a bit longer and see where its going."

I know way too many companies that were basically three card monty. Sucking up VC money. Padding sales data when they showed up at the offices. Pipeline stuffing. Also, essentially we will buy X or advertise c on your platform if you do the same with us. Just shuffling VC money around the room to look like platform had interest or their was sales. I wouldnt doubt there are probably some companies like that now. But that was so much about infancy. This is not infancy. This is massive corporations with massive earnings and cash hoards throwing that cash at being first movers ... its that important. It would be idiotic for the meta nvda msft types, downstream chip players and fabs, software value add players, to be burning through their cash as they are. They know history. They know what is playing out here. Having used ChatGPT for a myriad of things, my wife the same. I have been learning prompts, she just learn as you go, we are stunned at the impact on our lives and then I read and see what else is happening that makes what we are doing silly. When companies like msft are throwing down 125B on a single datacenter as an example. You just dont do that on hype. This race is critical to corporate survival and global balances of power. Hell even China is creating a regulatory body to ensure we dont end up AIing wwiii with all of it. Tech companies are readily letting people go, hiring at lower salaries bc AI is changing the landscape for standard computer science guys. Just look at the silly things your person at home is doing on social media with AI tools. And then imagine what the players are doing with the best minds and engineers in the countryworld. We havent even started to speak to timelines on healthcare and processing data regarding studies and time to insight on drug candidates. Learning is going to be accelerated by magnitudes and at speed we cant fathom. Things will be needed. Necessity is the mother of invention. It doesnt not fail. Power sources will be uncovered.

This is almost certainly technically possible and will happen to one extent to another. The unknown is to what extent will entrenched processes at these companies slow it down or stop it from happening altogether, but the potential to revolutionize how business is done is equal than or greater what happened during the rise of the dot coms, since that mostly impacted how companies communicated. This has the potential to automate everything else."

Strategists dont have to spend as much time looking for specific data now that Ai can find some of the patterns much quicker. Ive also seen them create the target market persona pages using Ai. There is still a lot of human input required to create a working strategy, but Ai has sped up the process. Take this section with a grain of salt since its not what I interact with the most, just what Ive heard from friends. Creatively, Ai has mainly sped up a lot of the behind the scenes work. Pitch theater if you will. I used to work in an agency in which art directors were photoshop gurus and could mock something up to elevate a concept. That is now a thing of the past, generative Ai can do that so much quicker. Its not perfect, but when youre trying to just pitch something internally, Ai is more than good enough. Also, why use stock images when you can get Ai to create much more custom imagery to represent your idea. Its not uncommon to use Ai as the foundation and then incorporate photoshop to truly hone the visual. All in all, you dont need as many people to be part of pitches now. When we hire external production companies I now see countless Ai images. A production company had one of their character concept artists run their 2D drawings through Ai to show how they would look in 3D. These were still flat images, not renders, but I was incredibly surprised by quality of mock. You wouldve NEVER gotten to see 3D visuals of a character before getting client approval on the concept art, but with Ai you can now accelerate things that were further down the pipeline. Copywriting. I mean, not much to add here. Long scripts and ideation still gets a lot of love from my coworkers, but the quick tweets and captions that they used to hate, thats Ai work now. This is probably simplifying A LOT of things, but I cant deny that Ai is already altering the workspace. Mainly by making everything move a lot faster, and if there is one thing that advertising clients LOVE, its fast. The pace of advertising has always been relentless, and in some way, Ai has come to both alleviate and exacerbate the problem. If your agency can produce more ads that target more people, you can bring more clients. The industry has changed and many clients are doing one off projects instead of signing annual contracts with agencies, but thats not to say agency of record is not a thing anymore. An advertising agency is not just selling individual ads, its selling a whole suite of creative and strategy services. If Ai can be successfully integrated into this service to cut timelines and budgets, you better believe clients will flock to that agency."

The use case for AI in advertising is clear and pretty straightforward.

Same with maybe some higher dividend stocks you may be down on share price or right near break even. Dont completely eliminate either area of your portfolio, but trim it down some. As for ETFs I like SPYI, they hold many SP companies and they leverage options to give you 12 dividend. Basically they do the leg work of options so you dont have to, and use the money to pay I high dividend. You can look it up, see if it is right for you. Maybe it isnt. But regardless of if you enter an ETF, I would cut your portfolio down to 2530 positions and increase position size.

From the fact you dont know and are asking these questions, plus some of the investing thesis youve stated, the odds are extremely against you outperforming. Also, a 2 year test is nearly meaningless in terms of actual investing. The rudimentary thumbnail can be this easy tell me what lump sums and dates andor if you did any regularly monthly type contributions and what size. Then tell me todays portfolio balance. Rule of thumb is you should be spending 12 hours per position per week. So it is possible to have 50 positions Ive managed up to 40 for a fund if you put in the time and discipline and patience and are actively managing it. I enjoyed being able to look at the portfolio any given day or week and see overbought positions that could be used to harvest gains, and marry them up to watch lists that had desirable names that were oversold. Out of 40, theres almost always at least a few that are suitable for trading. And of the 40, there could certainly be some that you can tolerate being dead money for months or even years, then theyd move 40 in a day and could be sold to still meet our overall long term investing target return. With 4 positions, it would be much harder to let a dormant position tie up capital for so long. If youre managing a portfolio full time, having a continual schedule of earnings and dividends keeps one engaged and sharp with markets and sentiments. Until you give your numbers, best educated guess is youd be far better off with a small bundle of ETFs for the vast majority of your capital. Maybe you could alot yourself a tiny fund that you give you herself permission to lose every cent, restrict yourself to 5 equal size positions, and then trade your heart out. See if you are the rare exception who can trade well. If you do well with your 5 stock miniport over a tenplus year period, you could consider whether to expand on it. But whatever you do, think of your time versus value. Suppose you being active nets you 12 and passive does 8, then whats that 4 worth and whats your time worth. On a million portfolio, thats 40,000 and maybe 20x501000 hours. Your work and risk is thus worth 40hour. Maybe thats good for you. On 100k portfolio thats 4hour, and you might realize youd be better off waiting tables for 20hour and taking less risk."

Step 3 If you dont already have it, track all of your individual buys and sells of your stock in a spreadsheet. Step 4 Add some columns in the spreadsheet for assuming you bought into your SP 500 index instead with the same dollar amount. Be consistent, like using the closing price of your index on that date unless you just so happened to also buy into that index on the same day, in which case you can use that price instead. Step 5 Now that you have the number of share youd own of that index see how the number tracks compared to your real world outcome. I find this to be a very helpful exercise for me.

First, they have to be able to create an incredibly efficient chip for both training and inference, second a CUDAequivalent, third to steer ML frameworks to force it to adopt a new nonCUDA architecture, fourth is to force researchers and developers to develop new models catered to the new hardwares alongside all dependencies, etc. People who hasnt trained complex models or created them or deployed them are so uninformed about how tightly integrated NVIDIA is to everything. Tech moats are a different kind of moat. Integrations are one strong thing in tech. And NVIDIAs moat is just incredibly complex.

My personal thinking is that Google is gonna bottleneck itself with their own TPU hardware sooner or later as they are either gonna fully commit to it or just suddenly pivot using NVIDIA again similar to their switch from Qualcomm to Tensor G1G4 with Samsung fabs to TSMC moving foward. They will, however, be perpetually contending within the leaderboards for LLM although my personal favorites leading these would still be META and OpenAI for different reasons. GOOG has a personal motivation to do it tho since they have the Google Assistant thing which is probably their biggest usage of this in addition to GSuite additions.

I dont hold any of AMD and Google just because I am still incredibly confused as to what their goals are. Personally I dont think Google will outpace NVIDIA and they are two different companies. Google is software and Nvidia is hardware CUDA which isnt really a replicable software. Googles direct competitor is Microsoft and somehow META. I just think that Googles software side is incredibly replicable and that the shift from perspectives that their sales are gonna go from ads to AI will have a tough time. On the software end, I got Microsoft or even META. META just because Gen AI tools is going to be extremely connected to their biggest shtick which is content creator platforms, and the fact that META, IMHO, has the best AI research team. FAIR has been producing the best AI papers for the past years most esp in computer vision. People dont know that things such as Magic Eraser, Magic Lasso Tool root itself from METAs Segment Anything which is the most ground breaking thing in Computer Vision alongside Diffusion Models. Microsoft too have strong integrations with software from Teams to MS Office suite and Windows. Most underrated is Github and Github Copilot. They literally own a shit ton of free code to train LLM models. For AMD, I am not so well versed on their products. They wont be able to compete with NVIDIA some time in the future. Honestly, if I were them, I would just try to completely dunk on the sinking ship that is Intel and fabricate CPUs that tightly integrate with NVIDIA GPUs on cloud clusters i do have a local AMD Ryzen laptop with RTX i use for local small training of models. Current virtual machines right now still have Intel NVIDIA GPUs e.g. V100, A10G. If AMD will just focus on beating Intel instead of NVDA, they could just win the AI race alongside them. If NVIDIA gets tired of Intels bullshit, I can see them fabricating their own CPUs. NVIDIA will still be the strongest contender by a mile for atleast 57 years. I cant see anyone coming closely to rivaling their moat until then. Even if a war breaks out in Taiwan and new chips halt in production for some time, the remaining functioning data centers can still function IMO. One company that I suggest worth looking at is definitely Qualcomm. They are trying to enter the desktop space and making the edge device phones, etc. much beefier to have its own Neural Processing Unit that are capable to run multimodal models. As phones get better in that, they have less need to access cloud servers which in turn means less need for GPU servers NVIDIA. Although Qualcomms direct competitor at that space is Apple which is gonna do the same. I am not an FI, but as an AI engineer, I am bullish on NVIDIA. I would definitely think that it is quite overhyped by people right now because it has been an AI arms race and every one is trying to race which AI product will be the first to profit. The purchasing will slow down. However, believe it or not, we are just scratching the surface for what AI can do. Diffusion models are just only around for about 3 years, LLMs for 2.5 years, and we havent reached those breakthroughs to the traditional AI real money makers yet such as detection and reinforcement learning but I have a feeling that it will come out sooner. But the thing is that comparing it to crypto is crazy because AI has business use cases and profitable as long as it has the proper market. NVIDIA is just creating more data centers to keep up with the cloud service demands from AWS, Azure, etc. but even if the demand gets low, they can always sell the access to services for cheap and still get money from it. But who knows, thats the free market for you."

Gross services volume is basically the same as it was a year ago. Revenue is only up because they keep increasing the take rate. 19 of what the clients pay now goes to UpWork. Their revenue guidance for Q3 is less than what they made in Q2. So they might enter a phase of negative growth now. Caused by declining usage which cannot be offset by further increasing the take rate. They keep focussing on enterprise deals and neglect the marketplace experience. Although the marketplace is the 6x bigger business. Clients who use the marketplace still get 3 ! invoices and receipts per week ! even if they just work with one freelancer. Who wouldnt want to add 19 to their freelancer cost and the hassle to add 12 documents per month to their tax paperwork? TlDr They focus on their sales team, neglect the product, make it more and more expensive, usage growth declines. They still have a great starting point as the market leader in work marketplaces. But unless they change the approach, I think nothing will come out of it. If the business slips away, my hope is that a new, more product oriented CEO will come into play."

Average spent per buyer is 4x smaller on Fiverr compared to UpWork. When you commission a onetime job like a logo, it doesnt matter if you pay 100 or 130. That wont make you take the job off the platform. But when you work with a freelancer on a constant basis, you start to think about why you pay UpWork every month too. Because the only thing you get for it is the invoicing. And when that invoicing is done super badly 12 monthly documents instead of 1, 4 monthly payments instead of 1 you will think hard if you really want to continue using that service."

And with the guidance of 6 revenue for Q3, it stands to be expected that usage will start shrinking now. Despite over a hundred million Dollars spent on sales and marketing per year. My interpretation UpWorks service is good at the beginning of the user journey. To match buyers and sellers. But then it becomes a chore. Because of the weekly invoice cycle and the separate invoicing from sellers and UpWork. That makes it an 8x worse solution than direct seller to buyer invoices. UpWork gained a massive amount of users during covid. And now those users abandon the service. Its a long way down to precovid levels. It can make the business decline for years. On the upside, UpWork might have the potential to become as big as the other market place leaders. Amazon, Uber, Booking, AirBnB, Shopify etc are all orders of magnitude larger than UpWork and I dont see a reason the leading work market place shouldnt become as big as those. But I think that would require a shift in the way UpWork is run. As the current approach to growth is not working. As can be seen in the numbers."

As for the user growth, it isnt actually declining. The of active clients is growing. Last year, they announced a change in their fee structure. It used to be multitier 20, then 10, then 5. So, the larger the contract, the lower the fee UpWork takes. The new structure is a flat 10 fee for all. I do think some contracts were taken outside of UpWork, which led to a reduction in the average spend per client which is reflected in the Gross service volume decline. I do think this is temporary, as with any price increase decision made."

So I dont see a reason to think that is a seasonal effect. In 2023Q2 it was 0.6. In 2022Q2 it was 1.77. So basically what the number tells us is that they lost more clients in 2024Q2 than they won in 2023Q2. Still, the 6 active clients YoY look kinda good, so if those would be the only numbers we have QoQ and YoY, I would say I dont know what to think. Lets wait until next quarter. But we also have the guidance of 6 in revenue QoQ. The worst guidance in the history of UpWork. And they explain it with negative trends in the topoffunnel which could mean active clients or spent per client I think and expect it to continue We did see those trends get slightly worse in June and July And they talk about working on anticircumvention efforts in the call. You can find it in the transcript. Which should mean they will try to stop buyers and sellers from leaving the platform once they have found each other. Why would they have to do that if their users wanted to use the invoicing service they provide? The users dont want it. I dont think you can grow a business by saying We have a good service and a bad service. We give you a good service for a few days and then well force you to use our bad service forever."

And on chip power delivery to get that battery life up past 8 hours and it will likely run cool and compete with them on all fronts. Intel has working silicon for their 18A which is 1.8 NM, and its coming in 1st half. They will be a foundry by 2027. TSMC could barely get 3nm going. No competition and constant misses. So lets this sink in for a bit. They literally have an Apple silicon answer and an ARM answer. They are literally building foundries with technology that TSMC is frantically trying to catchup on and is 6 months behind for onboard power delivery for example. And x86 is widely compatible and companies will eat it up. Cutting bloated staff, got 8 billion from the govt to see to this plan through etc. And telegraphed and told us it would be a rough quarter. The 13th and 14th gen is the only woldcard that is driving emotions high for an over represented group of edgy gamers who upgrade their CPUs every 24 years. They just tacked on a 2 year extended warranty. Move on. Its just not rational this doom and gloom stance. Logical people are being drowned out by people heavy into Nvidia and who know nothing about the actual products and how it is beyond competitive. Remember Jensens biggest fear.

Well... those AI companies are hemorrhaging money, billions, and what happens when those investors come knocking? Well, like we saw today, those who have shared interest will signal to buy at a discount and then opportunistically sell off in afterhours. Public sentiment is bad because a lot of people lost money by thinking line always go up, yet it never did. Besides the nonsense of the modern market, Intel is the one who will support the US when the inevitable happens across the pacific, and public sentiment will change when nobody can get their precious AI chips. The investors are starting to see that AI burns more money than it generates, is projected to burn more, and still hallucinates wildly limiting its usefulness.

As a disclaimer, I own NVDA and TSM substantial positions and recently added more on the pullback, and will ride out any swings between now and late August when NVDA reports, which better be a really great report or it will tank, but it probably will be great or everyone will be scrambling to find out where the spend went. Right now, investors are obviously getting skeptical about AI cap ex, which will eventually result in lower mag 7 cap ex, which will be really bad for semis, but thats a second derivative effect and the arms race definitely isnt ending right now. Ill seriously shave my toptier semi positions when these cap ex numbers start dropping in a meaningful way or when LLM traininginference ASICs start eating NVDAs lunch. As far as I know, AVGO just added to a meaningful buyandhold position and TSM are the way for a nonaccredited investor to play the eventual ASICs wave, but NVDA could also come out with their own ASICs. But right now, the megacap CEOs are really excited about AI and they have the money to spend on it. They still have good cash flow and can still spend big if they want to. I think LLMs and other applications of transformers will continue to get better, theyll be faster, smaller models will be better, and context windows will be larger before the LLMs start spitting out hallucinations and functionally break. With the right training techniques, which are still evolving, the transformer that LLMs is based on can remarkably improve on really overdetermined data, which breaks what I used to know about signals analysis and training oldschool neural networks. I think we are going through a routine lowvolume summer pullback with hedge funds piling into the previously lagging R2K, which makes momentum plays swing like crazy. But, hedge funds will be back, and theyll long the same positions they shorted months earlier, and then theyll short them again. Its fine for investors to hold the feet of megacaps to the fire, but that just brings their PE multiples closer to normal for a tech stock. Other position disclaimers Google small LT buyandhold position, they are behind and will probably lose search market share but I wont bet against their data and proprietary tensor core iterations Microsoft small longheld position Meta no position due to longstanding antipathy plus I think they are behind with AI and the metaverse and they have more limited room to grow because 3.5 billion users is a lot, even if many of those are bots. I think they will outperform but wont be in the drivers seat. I still dont see how Zuck is going to monetize their opensource LLM models while Microsoft at least has a plan that may kick in when copilot improves and copilot subscriber numbers improve. I may be in the minority, but I think this will happen eventually, cant say when. Im personally scared of AI Windows, but I think Microsoft will try to copy whatever Apple does, with more ads and less privacy, and make money."

                    "text": "Youre right that YoY growth is a really bad metric to value a high PE stock, as is comparing this quarter this year, vs the same quarter last year. For me to buy a stock with a high PE, it better have higher revenues and higher earnings every quarter and those numbers better have a strong correlation to each other and to EPS those boxes are checked. I like to look at quarterly revenue and EBDITA I have plugged in the numbers, and I would argue that these numbers are both statistically linear. The revenue numbers do a fit a parabolic fit better than a linear fit, hinting at slowing revenue growth. But, the parabolic fit will always be better than the linear fit, whether or not it has meaning, and quarterly earnings reports make for very sparse data. Im expecting roughly linear but moderating revenue and EPS growth and will unload if there is a big surprise to the downside. With linear EPS growth for the next year out, earnings for the next year would be 23 times higher, making the forward PE, which ignores analyst estimates, very reasonable. Growth will probably moderate because of supply chain constraints and moderation in demand. But, Nvidia doesnt need a PE close between 20 and 30 a year out at these prices because highgrowth market leaders always command a PE premium. But, its very plausible that revenue growth is slowing because TSMs production capacity is a bottleneck and it takes a long time to build new fabs, which TSM is doing. However, Nvidia has historically kept its margins very high when there is strong demand. I think the pertinent historical examples are the last bitcoin bubble preASICs and Cisco around its nosebleed peak with a PE over 200. During the crypt0 bubble Nvidia absolutely crushed it while reddit gamers had daily tantrums about Nvidia charging unfair prices for their GPUs. That lasted until ASICs made it unprofitable to mine with an allpurpose GPU, crypt0 started crashing and Nvidia crashed. Im watching Mag 7 cap ex because Cisco collapsed roughly the month after its biggest customers like Worldcom, ATT, AOL, Qwest, and Sprint started dramatically cutting their cap ex. The now bankrupt Worldcom was an outright criminal fraud that was buying Cisco routers to pretend that they were making money to pump their share prices. So Im worried about demand, Im worried about ASICs, respectively thinking about Cisco and the last crypt0 bubble. The main reason I bought more AVGO because its price is down and because OpenAI is building a new secret chip with Broadcom, which is almost certainly a new ASIC chip that will rely on Broadcom and TSM. Also, broadcom should benefit from its auto and manufacturing chips and cell phone sales will probably pick up if rates go down and its a given that they will go down. But, major risks are that the economy is definitely slowing by almost any metric and the Fed is always late with their rate moves, with their backwardlooking data analysis, and whats bad for the economy is bad for everyone. Also, from now to October is historically a very bad time for semis and Wall Street knows it. Also, we know that if investors revolt on spend, CEOs like Zuck will dramatically cut back on cap ex, like he did after the Metaverse crash. I think if one megacap CEO cuts back on GPU spend, they all will, as I feel they are defensively spending to not get left behind, so the script can flip and growth can turn into misses in a hurry. Finally, I feel that most semi and software stocks are overvalued and catching AI tailwinds for no reason and this will hurt the few stocks with good performance, because hedge algos will work to keep correlated pairs of stocks correlated. The conflict between Iran and Israel could blow up in the near future. Also, the performance of bigger and bigger transformers could hit a wall, but I dont think theres evidence of that yet. I dont think humans are special and that there are intrinsic limits about what humans can do and future AI cant. However, better GPUs will someday be locked down even in the U.S., as a national security issue. But, I have a longterm horizon, and the megacaps that are pumping money into NVDA havent cut back on cap ex yet. Nadela says there is still increasing cloud demand and the probability that he is telling truth is greater than the probability that he is lying. I can afford to be wrong about the future and Ill still pay a lot of taxes when I exit."

I think calling peaks and bottoms is a losing game and trying to predict a peak years out is even more of a losing game. But, if I had to guess, I think the peak will come when we see dotcomlast crypt0 bubble levels of hype in a lower interest rate environment. Youll see a ton of startup IPOsSPACs with no earnings or plans for earnings that investors will lose a lot of money on. You will see ads pumping and shilling twobit moneylosing AI companies on TV while insiders sell the dominant portions of their stakes. NVDAs PE might go substantially north of 100, then LLM ASICs could be produced at scale. Then, my friends and relatives that ignored my advice to buy years ago will ask if now is a good time to make a big investment, and Ill know its over and its time to research boring stocks with stable dividends. A massive crash will happen, which will go way too far on the downside. Just randomly guessing, this is not a prediction, July 30th 2026 could be a peak, plus or minus a year. But, AI is here to stay until the next EMP and it will continue to improve. Modern transformers were created in June of 2017, GPT3 came out in November of 2022, commensurate with the start of NVDAs rally, things are still getting better. Cloud is still growing at all of the major providers. The AI spend is on GPUs and it can take 510 to get a return out of a GPU or cluster, so it isnt reasonable to expect returns on cloud compute to equal the expense right now. Itll be fun until it gets scary!"

I read an article about the Harvard endowment recently and how theyve lagged behind public equities for a decade. Theres supposed to be an illiquidity premium for investing in private markets, but apparently all theyve gotten is illiquidity and no premium. If they indexed instead, not only would they had done better, but they wouldve payed less fees in the process. Private markets and alternatives are the new hot thing on the street because now retail is gaining access to it. More money flooding in will probably mean that illiquidity premium youre supposed to get will be less. Also, net of fees youre probably right around public equities and maybe even less depending on the manager. Im not saying not to invest in it, just want you to be aware of some of the risks.

Thought most people should be less actively involved and mostly should be watching their fees. Specifically, the access to private alternative funds is limited for the average retail investor AND those investments they can get to, have their earnings results eroded by excessive fees. The most important difference, in terms of categories of investors, is between those who can make highquality active management decisions and those who cant. Pioneering Portfolio Management is for those who have the ability to manage portfolios actively. Unconventional Success is a book for the overwhelming number of individual and institutional investors who cannot manage a portfolio actively. Almost everybody belongs on the passive end of the continuum. A very few belong on the active end. But the unfortunate fact is that an overwhelming number of investors find themselves betwixt and between. In that inbetween place, people end up paying high fees whether to a mutual fund or a stockbroker or another agent. And they end up with disappointing net returns. And, Im old enough to remember when most institutional investors didnt even have small cap or nonUS investments, let alone alternatives. So, small caps, nonUS, and emerging markets were, once, alternatives. Then high yield and global bonds were alternative. So, whats an alternative? Whatever wall street wants to package and sell you for a fee, regardless of return potential So, what do i invest in? PE? Typically follows returns of the small cap market, without the lockup or fees of a decent small manager. So, Im 25 small today based on valuations. Vanguard strateq. Private Credit? You can find loan funds, like Eaton Vance or Invesco. Not today thanks, sold it off from last year, and sold off hy when spreads went super tight. Are long bonds alts? Real estate, are my own properties. Others should maybe use vanguard reit index. Hedge funds? Nope. Crypto. A 5 allocation to a diversified etf because, fkit."

Self driving cars isnt what you would expect as Amazon had done it with their warehouses. They use a selfdriving robot to move the entire shelf to a human for picking, instead of having humans run around the warehouse for picking. There isnt going to be a big overnight change as people would have imagined but rather slowly replacing humans starting from tasks until it could replace the job entirely. Likely the Internet didnt change how we lived during the dot com rush but fast forward to today, the Internet fundamentally changed how we live.

Im sure there are valid uses for AI, and Im sure most companies trying for buzzword AI compliance arent using AI for anything useful or meaningful.

Now as it affects investing theres a lot of money changing hands based on AI promises, so yes there is a bit of a bubble. But I believe there wont be a sudden burst of that bubble....so many companies have made significant investments into their AI infrastructures that theyll be able to pivot into more useful things when the truth about AI capabilities or lack thereof sets in. It wont just be a bunch of money lost, but they will have to redirect their resources. Yes, there are some acquisitions happening today including where I work that wont pan out in the end, so thats money lost but only for the acquirer, the equity owners of the acquired company have converted their equity into cash, which flows back into more investments, more companies, purchases in the economy, etc. So while I do believe theres a bit of overvaluation in the market based on AI hype, I dont think there will be a sudden bubble burst. It will be a slow correction, IMO, and might be marginalized by all of the other factors driving market movements, and therefore not even noticeable. IMO investing to bet against AI wont make you rich. You could make some money, yes, but probably wont be a huge win.

I deal with a lot of these big cloud vendors AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, MongoDB. The first thing they say when you get on a call with them for anything is have you tried our AI product. Like you get on a call with your account manager to talk about something completely unrelated you need help for and they start pitching AI until you shut them down just so you can get to the actual reason for the call. My answer is that none of our customers are clamoring for AI feature in our product or even asking for that matter, so its not a priority. I think the big tech companies will keep investing though.Microsoft started a war when they invested so heavily in Open AI. This is as much about big tech like Google, AWS, etc... protecting their turf as anything else. Its worth it for them to spend billions on Nvidia chips as insurance to protect their businesses just in case AI takes over. And the hype machine is about generating ROI for the massive investments in a technology that clearly isnt ready yet. Based on what Im seeing, were still a long way from achieving what the hypesters are promising. Doesnt mean we wont get there eventually, but its hard to predict stuff thats maybe 5 years out. Maybe it doesnt ever pan out. Seems like AI has made some leaps recently, but its been around for like 25 years and always seems to be 5 years out."

The answer The Sony a6400 camera has an electronic viewfinder EVF with a refresh rate of 60 frames per second fps. Further question can you do it on a6300? the answer Yes, the Sony a6300 does offer an option to increase the electronic viewfinder EVF refresh rate. You can choose between two refresh rates 60 fps default 120 fps high To change the EVF refresh rate on the a6300 Go to the Menu. Navigate to the Setup tab. Look for the option labeled FINDER FRAME RATE. You can select either Standard 60 fps or High 120 fps. The higher refresh rate of 120 fps provides a smoother experience, which can be beneficial for tracking fastmoving subjects. However, it may consume more battery power. Now whats the real answer? Taken from the review website The A6400 inherits the same 2.36 million dot OLED electronic viewfinder from the A6300, which features a 120fps high frame rate setting to help track moving subjects more smoothly with virtually no lag. Further communication I think you made a mistake, because A6400 features the same EVF as the a6300 and it seems thier refresh rates can be adjusted both to 120fps. ChatGPT fallows up Youre correct, and I apologize for the confusion. The Sony a6400, like the a6300, does indeed allow you to adjust the electronic viewfinder EVF refresh rate to either 60 fps or 120 fps. To adjust the EVF refresh rate on the a6400 Go to the Menu. Navigate to the Setup tab usually represented by a toolbox icon. Find the Finder Frame Rate option. Select either Standard 60 fps or High 120 fps. The 120 fps setting provides a smoother viewing experience, particularly useful for tracking fastmoving subjects. However, keep in mind that it might lead to increased battery consumption.

And this is after watching an interview with the CEO of Google DeepMind Demis Hassabis In the short term, AI is overhyped because people are saying it will soon be able to do all these amazing things, and Hassabis says the same thing. AI is advancing quite quickly, with the next big thing being AI agents that can complete complex tasks for you, like an assistant. But thats not going to be in the short term, but moreso in the longer term. Im suspecting 45 years, personally. And that will be a big deal in terms of the tasks it can do for you. But we are not there yet. And this is similar to what Hassabis says, where longterm it may be underhyped but personally I think longer term it is just hyped. I think when companies are able to get AI agents to work, it will hit its stride. Want to also mention, that in an interview with Squawk Pod with Andy Jassy, the CEO of amazon he talked about AI, and the investments amazon is making on 3 major macro areas. One of them being for companies wanting to train their own AI models. And another for companies wanting to use existing models developed by other companies and amazon themselves. So, personally. I think we are still in the short term. Companies and developers are still learning about AI and how to make something concrete with it. Things like chatgpt and Gemini are amazingly impressive imo, but companies have not fully crystalized a way to monetize these tools and learn how to actually use them. Im looking longterm, and the companies investing in AI will benefit, assuming they make the right decisions on how to integrate with their business. But it will not be immediate, and it wont be an immediate spike in businesses but a gradual increase."

What I see is a cluster of AI models accomplishing the job. LLM, like chatGPT are wonderful to understand human language. What I see in the future is someone telling chatGPT I wanna make a trading app collecting the past 20 years of data using free tools and find some correlation between price movement based on any individual or group of indicators, market sentiments, commodities, ect. And then make price projection based on those correlations. and get his app working, adapt to his visions and limited technical knowledge needed to make it happens. BUT I dont see chatGPT doing all the understanding, work planification and execution by his own. What I see is ChatGPT understanding the assignment, putting the technical word on top of those simple words, sending function calls to other models gathering the necessary tools, information and structures needed so his application can be made by his own. In this cases, yeah AI will be able to run a company by his own based on human methodologies, human discovery and human morality.

I shudder to think that the current trend is about ignoring the basics of inspection filtering, reference location, pattern matching, test construction, etc. which dont involve AI at all. AI is exciting research, but I think we are witnessing the breakdown in modern venture capitals investment ability to distinguish business problems and solutions. The risky financing behind technology has gotten out of control, and the ability to profit from it has become more about hype for a new technology than about profits or applicability to real world problems. It is a completely circular sales cycle where a technology generates hype, gets funded, and then the VCs are covered through financing offered by float from cloud service providers that see more volume in service consumption. It is all just a dance where we are running compute cycles for no reason except to prop up investment in a tech startup whose primary value is consuming more cloud services. AI is the final cycle of this because it gives you an excuse to consume a ton of resources to train these models, and not have to worry about the business effects of what these models can actually deliver until you are finished. I see a huge bubble coming when companies realize that these models are not competitive, and they wasted a ton of money and investment training them.

I fully believe you, but I also dont think youre thinking of your experience in the right way. When it comes to new tech, companies never wait until its 100 perfectly flawless before they put it in normie hands. This is because the data from your experience services development in a way that a lab environment cannot. I can compare it to a couple of different things. 1 Video game developers doing public betas for releases and consequential updates. There is basically an open admission from every type of software developer that they need widespread public usage data and feedback in order to effectively develop, and this is the most obvious, consumerunderstabdable example. Githubs baseline operating methodology is along the same lines. The thinking is that once they have a ton of anecdotal scenarios like yours, they can then fix the problems youre pointing out effectively, in a targeted manner. It is very difficult to anticipate your situation and develop against the possibility of that outcome in a lab setting without a time machine to work with. In video games case, theyre often assessing pixeltopixel interactions, so bots cant possibly give them the same data humans can. Does that mean theyre putting out an unfinished product at first? Sure, technically you could describe it that way. But its normal. 2 Chip readers at stores. Do you remember when the collective powers that be moved us from swiping to inserting, and later from inserting to tapping? Something no one feels the need to talk about is the fact that the newest method was always jank as hell for the first couple years of existing. There was a solid year of my life where 3 failed inserts followed by a swipe was my normal, every visit routine at the grocery store. I had no one to Karen at, and I never asked for this repetitive routine to be added to my life, but there it was, and if I wanted groceries I had to comply. I dont bother tapping yet because inserting once is finally working consistently, so Ill do that until they force me to switch methods again. Thats how all of this technology goes, and its how it will always go. Things will be released with issues so the public can provide the kind of broad feedback loop that simplifies the last chunk of development. Im not an AI investor, but youre using doomspeak to describe something completely normal in the software development world. Its like youre describing all the risky things the sun can do to blind or kill a person, but then taking that all the way to the argument that this is why existing under the sun cant last forever.

Machine learning would come in if the part placement relative to the camera shifts around for whatever reason. For example if you wanted to extract a mask or bounding box of the part as a preprocessing step. You can even use a model like Florence to generate embeddings and measure the distribution of the embeddings from data coming off the assembly line.

I dont think AI is overhyped. Actually, I think people largely dont appreciate its full potential. However, it could still be another decade or two before we fully reach that point. When we do, however, the world will be a very different place. It will be at least as large of a leap as the internet ushered in. If youre too young to remember needing to consult an encyclopedia or filling out an order form to mail away for something you may not fully appreciate the extent to which our lives have changed postinternet and you may not realize that it all started with a 2400bps dialup connection to ASCII message boards. Thats about where AI is right now somewhere between proof of concept and marginally useful in certain applications. 20 years ago the idea that a computer would be able to recognize a random image of a cat was virtually unthinkable. Now it can not only identify a cat it can nearly instantly generate an new image of an American Wirehair holding a sparkler while flying over Mt. Fuji in a wingsuit. My programming IDE autogenerates about 25 of my code out of thin air with zero effort on my part. These are HUGE leaps, and theyve occurred very quickly. The problem with AI is really just consistency. Something that fails 510 of the time isnt particularly useful in most cases even if the results most of the time are mindblowing. But that error rate will improve with additional training. More importantly, however, is that the learning algorithms are still being refined. Very soon we may be able to reduce the required training data sets by several orders of magnitude, for example. In the short term the AI bubble may or may not burst the way the dotcom bubble did. But, long term, I expect it to be a fundamental force in virtually all aspects of modern life just as the internet has now become."

Modern videos at first glance look real. This is a tech thats still basically in its infancy.

Recall that many of the breakthroughs in science and technology throughout history have come from combining disparate ideas from multiple disciplines and synthesizing something new. So the existing LLMs out there are very powerful tools. Full disclaimer I have a subscription to Claude.AI, and often use it as part of my work or for helping me learn. But my point was that while hardware will definitely improveand with improved hardware we may also see opportunities for improving softwareas you said, were reaching the asymptotic limit of what we can do with language and with a language model that essentially operates as a next word or next phrase predictor. And until we figure out a better theory of mind, what we got now is more or less it. That is, were going to have to shovel in more and more stuff in there for very small incremental improvements in intelligence. Its an amazing tool, and I do agree with you that it does have the power to transform our economyonce folks figure out the right ways to apply these tools. For me, I use it as a means to get some crossdisciplinary insight, which is fascinating. But as I noted before in my downvoted remarks LLMs are starting to reach an asymptote where the improvements are slowing down and becoming more incremental rather than fundamental. ... And it will require a fundamental rethinking of how AI works to move past where we are now. For example, Id love it if someone working on CoPilot would consider somehow marrying it with a toolset that can do dataflow analysis, semantic flow analysis and a method for onmachine code analysis such as variable usage as part of the underlying model. Meaning Id love it if CoPilot would not make stupid errors, like suggesting code that calls routines that are misnamed or that are guessed at, or calling out using variables that do not exist or are named differently."

I personally would like to see the day when we can roll out a smallscale LLM that runs on a Teddy Ruxpinlike toy that can run enough of an LLM to hold sophisticated conversations with small children that can run off two Ccells. But from a software perspective the improvements were seeing in LLMs seem to be less fundamental and more incremental. In part, were simply hitting the limits of the philosophical theories of language and intelligenceor rather, the presumption that intelligence is strictly a linguistic construct rather than is based on an understanding of the world that is deeper than the symbols we attach to that meaning. Or, framed another way, LLMs currently do not have a model of the world or a model of how the world works essentially they predict the next word or collection of words that would go in a sentence as a response to an input collection of words. Its why there are so many examples of LLMs getting basic math wrong, or why we see things like CoPilot write shitty software because there is no understanding there. Just the manipulation of symbols. And the people currently working on the next generation of LLMs are essentially operating on the theory that if we could just shovel more shit in there, well get smarter LLMs. My own theory is that until we have a better theory of mind than the ideas from philosophical linguists, were only going to see very minor incremental improvements in what is already out there. Sure, itll be less energy intensive and eventually we may even see it run locally on portable devices. But it wont be smarter. And we already know that the way the human mind processes information is not just linguistic in nature. For example, at my alma mater, work was done to identify the clusters of neurons in the human brain that drive our ability to recognize faces. That is, you dont learn how to recognize faces after youre born from some sort of tabula rasa instead, there is builtin hardware inside the human brain which handles this recognition, and that there is a finite number of these clusters may go towards explaining why Dunbars number seems to exist."

CoPilot is designed to sell you a little AI for a little money. If you want more capable AI you can pay about 10x as much not individually and get a lot of what you want with todays technology. Meaning Id love it if CoPilot would not make stupid errors, like suggesting code that calls routines that are misnamed or that are guessed at, or calling out using variables that do not exist or are named differently. Content window management systems solve that. CoPilot as designed just doesnt have enough RAG to give you what you want. You dont get much AI for 20employeemonth.

Or, more specifically, my interest in Artificial Intelligence came about in the early 1980s when I was in college and read the works of John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon. The second programming language I ever learned after BASIC on a TRS80 was LISP and my high school science fair project was building a primitive theorem prover which could solve basic problems in propositional calculus. Which, at the time, was considered Artificial Intelligence, but now is just a fascinating parlor trick done by nerds with too much time on our hands. Edit to add for those interested, the works I used to help me with my science fair projects were Patric Winstons Artificial Intelligence first edition and J.A. Robinsons Logic Form and Function."

Is the quality of life getting worse, of course not, like the rest of the world we take advantage of technology innovation and efficiency, but the US is no longer the best place to live for an average citizen. Were just not superior to the other top counties, as we used to be. Given the enormous size of our economy we should be. The examples of corporate welfare are plentiful. The biggest is healthcare. Consider that the biggest government expense is healthcare Medicare, Medicaid, VA, active service, ACA, employees, contractors employees, etc. The US federal government is the biggest buyer of healthcare in the world, but pays more per unit person, drug, etc than any other government. These prices could be negotiated down, but industry influence prevents that. FYI the Medicare drug negotiation that is much talked about today is a deception. The three drugs I checked all go off patent in 2026, the year the negotiated price comes into effect. In effect not costing big pharma anything. Eliquis, a drug used by someone I know, is more expensive in the US, the largest customer of it, than in any other country. The primary goals of ACA were two fold, lower prices and cover more people. More people are covered, but US prices continue to run wild. KFF, Kaiser Family Foundation has great studies of healthcare costs and effectively across the world. The US spends 34 times more for healthcare than the average of other developedrich nations. Other examples of government overpaying include military and even the broadband subsidies. The US pays 4 times more per fighter jet and Russia or China. It might be a better jet, but not so much better that one is more effective than three of theirs. The US has among the highest broadband Internet costs in the world. Too many poor and rural people cant afford the high cost. Rather than fostering competition to provide people options and keep prices down, the federal government just pays the overpriced broadband services from cable companies. This form of corporate welfare, overpaying, is not generally discussed, but it is bankrupting the US federal government and many citizens, and its making US based business operations and citizens less competitive in the global market. Know that this is not due to politicians not wanting to help constituents. This is due to the high likelihood that if they try to lower the ridiculously high prices Americans pay, theyll be fought with many millions of dollars the industry will spend in ads against them, funds to their opponents, etc. Its not the politicians that are the problem, its the system theyre in. And thats why changing the politicians changes little in real life. The real change is media. They make money off the big Republican vs Democrat distraction. And they make a ton of money running ads for the corporations who love that Americans government pay multiples more than other rich people whose governments they cant do readily manipulate. Can you imagine any of them reporting that their advertisers are screwing Americans with the by far the highest prices in the world? All the people, citizens, business leaders, politicians, etc are doing the best they can within the system we have. If you want a system thats great for corporations in spite of their whining for more more more youve got it in the US, just look at the US stock markets and corporate profitability. But if you want a system great for citizens and US based business operations, well the US needs some major reforms."

I am not sure how better to explain that the system is broken not the people not the politicians, not the business people and not Americans. For specifics look at the ACA vote. It passed, but got just about none of the savings initially proposed. Did all voting for it conspire to screw their constituents? No. Did those opposed screw their constituents? No. Did some poeple get insurance who didnt before? Yes. Did the healthcare companies make out like bandits. Yes.

If youre 25 and realistically just entered the workforce 23 years ago, youre going to be moving around and hopefully up in your career. No one stays at their first job for more than 23 years now and a lot of people are hopping around every 23 years especially early on for large pay raises and promotions. The issue with buying a house is it ties you down to a geographical location. Theres opportunity costs in only being able to accept positions within a reasonable commute to your house. For example, youre out job searching when its time for a moveupgrade and something paying a good 25 more with better benefits is on the other side of town and would make your commute jump from 3045 minutes to 1.5 hours each way. Do you take it? Suck it up? Try to sell the house and have to pay all the closing costs, moving, and other fees? If you were renting and more mobile, maybe its a 23 month fee and youre out, or perhaps youre cool with the landlord and theres no additional charge as long as you give a heads up of 12 months. Youre much more mobile. Point is, you buy a house when youre ready. Ideally with another person, like a wife or partner. Its bad enough we rent apartments as single people... buying a house single is even worse from a financial sense. All the expenses and upkeep are on you alone. Another financial thing to factor in are taxes and maintenancerepairs. Taxes are a lot these days and vary on area. Around here, taxes on a 300k house are actually more than our current rent. Taxes are essentially rent. so now youre paying a mortgage, have housing insurance, possibly PMI, interest to a bank... and youre paying rent taxes to the gooberment. Its expensive. Im in my mid30s and have had many friends buy houses. Nearly all of them cant attend events or do things on the weekend anymore. Why? XYZ project around the house. Maintenance. Cutting grass, painting, rebuilding retaining walls, fixing plumbing and other stuff. Its constant. Even when I lived with my parents I was constantly helping with projects.

The opportunity cost is too high Housing appreciates at 4.3 annually, while other assets like stocks appreciate at more like 10 annually. Or if we want real value, assuming 3 inflation, thats like 1.26 vs 6.8. The difference over long timespans is absurd, and every dollar you put into a house is a dollar you arent putting into those higher returning assets. Over the course of a 30 year mortgage, you can expect a house to go about 3.5x in value. But you could expect an index fund to grow about 17.5x in value. The cost of leverage ie. mortgage is too high. When mortgage rates were below 4.3, then you could reasonably expect to offset the leverage expense with gains in house price. Now, youre losing money on the deal. And paying it off early is just reducing leverage, so youre just transferring your losses from mortgage interest to losses from opportunity cost. The cost of ownership is probably higher than you think property tax, HOA, maintenance, home insurance, closing costs, etc.. Generally you save a lot by renting. The benefits from fixed mortgages tend to come in the second half of the mortgage, but taking a financial bath for 15 years is generally too big of a deficit to overcome, especially given current mortgage rates. Youre still at an age where you might move.... repeatedly. You can likely be more happy with renting a lessnice apartment than buying a lessnice house, because your commitment is generally only about a year. Which means you can save a lot more than even an apples to apples comparison. TLDR You should put off buying a home as long as possible and throw everything you can towards higher paying assets. Buying a home is fundamentally a conservative choice, and your risk appetite at age 25 should be much too high for buying a home. When to buy a home? Married with children. Nearing retirement and want to reduce risk profile Nonfinancial reasons, like you cant stand one more minute living in an apartment. You think youre living in an area that will absolutely explode in value, like Seattle 30 years ago. Theres some localized and temporary thing going on and buying is significantly cheaper than renting for some reason. Ballpark, 20 years rent is usually close to the price to buy. In some dying town, maybe its 10 years... but in a dying town, you probably wont get normal appreciation in home prices. But if for some reason there was an extreme but shortterm few years renting shortage, then maybe itd make sense. Youre really terrible at saving money so being forced to do it via your home is the only workable option for you."

You also buy less junk over time lol. To your point on immigration With millions of illegal entries into the US, as well as in most European countries, there will be tax implications on legal residents and citizens to help pay for services used by those migrants. For example, one major food manufacturer hired thousands of African migrants because they wanted to work. Many of those individuals asked more hours, their wages were lower, sure, but their numbers are substantial. Huge cost savings. There are news articles on this specific manufacturer, in the meat industry. Those migrants, who abide by the host nations laws and cultural norms, versus trying to protest against it or attempt to change it, are working jobs most host nation people do not want from my perspective. Other examples of tax implications California, Illinois, and New York use tax dollars to provide free housing, other services, and monthly income to many migrants. In other words, legal residents and citizens will see their tax dollars diverted to similar social policies that does not offer a direct benefit to those paying the bill. Worse, to sustain a social policy of that nature, with a growing migrant population and the challenges brought with that population as these migrants come from all walks of life and not everyone is vetted, requires tax increases. Since that is not politically advantageous, those leaders have proposed a wealth tax or a tax increase on higher income households."

There is also plenty of housing supply, there are simply not very many people with the skills or capital to fix the affordable housesnot enough people currently willing to adjust and move to a more rural area where housing is far cheaper than a metro area. I think there is a smaller subset of homeowners that simply cant wait to sell for whatever financial reason so they look to corporate buyers. The housing bubble is real, but its propped up by people who are willing to take insane mortgage agreements, including corporate buyers who are shooting themselves in the foot just like everyone else. All it takes is more people willing to hold out and let a few more banks fail so the remaining ones panic and create competitive pricing as a result. The Fed obviously isnt too perturbed by this or we would have seen rate cuts already. Not wishing for financial catastrophe here, just saying sometimes things have to get worse before they get better, especially to convince those who are financially insulated from the same consequences that most people face. Plenty of people with great points here, that top comment on proscons between home ownership vs apartment life is solid. I think the biggest issue is that everyone is too busy trying to carve out some exclusive skillset that pays 6 figures or more instead of going into a trade or another essential labor task within society. We should have more respect for regular jobs, and with that, products and services that dont only cater to a select few. That includes housing."

And as a home owner let me tell you that renting is significantly more convenient. Owning a home is historically not going to be as great of an investment as stocks, and this is especially true if you consider the ability to use tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and if your employer does matching. Id definitely recommend maxing your IRA401k first as the most efficient strategy. However if like many others you like the idea of owning a home then theres nothing wrong with saving for that.

This lets you amortize the closing costs over a decent period You can house hack, where you rent out some portion of the house to cover your housing costs You can house hop, where you buy a run down house and bring it back to move in ready so its more marketable. Then sell and do again with a different house. This is effectively a second job that you can do at your own pace. Just make sure you are careful to do it right so it actually adds value. Generally you can only gain the difference in value between what is was vs the upgrade I.e you have to live with something unusable until you replace it Also the general formula for cost is Interest payment Taxes Maintenance Closing Costs to Buy Closing Costs to Sellyears of ownership Opportunity Cost on invested principal Appreciation Equity invested The years helps spread closing costs and lower amount of equity improves how much effective ROI you have from appreciation. Principal paid is not a cost since you keep that money, but it does have an opportunity cost could have been invested elsewhere. People compare mortgage to rent, but its not that simple. You need to do the math for your situation. Personal story We house hopped on a run down rental that someone offloaded. Ripped everything out kitchen, bathrooms, flooring and replaced. Refinanced and got enough cash out to put a down payment on a second home and kept the first. Now were renting our first, renovating our second long term, but bought in bad condition, and have an airbnb at the new house that covers half the mortgage."

Either way, never go into a bank for a mortgage. Because youll end up paying more for it than you need to. The ONLY time I would buy retail is maybe a new construction home with a promo rate mortgage from their inhouse people that has been heavily bought down. As far as the future? Youre gonna be fine.

My partner at the time rented out her place to cover her mortgage and contributed a proportion of the cost of mine while she lived so both of us paid less for accommodation than we would have individually and both had our mortgages paid. Prod, the real.estate value went up. The costs were a smaller proportion of each paycheck because mortgages with fixed repayments are not affected by inflation, but our paychecks went up as we became more senior. I paid the same proportion of my income and paid off the mortgage faster. Continued over payments reduce the actual mortgage costs in a compound manner too. Fast forward, yes there were fewer exotic vacations and less disposable income, but the house was paid off fast, the equity saved, the financial security and backing in place to move to bigger and better homes.

The issue lies in the legal and consent side, you need permission from the government to build a house or buy a plot. For these you often need loans, which adds an extra layer of permission from banks. Combined with zoning rules, material and architectural form requirements as per the neighbourhood district requirements, the area youre building, wealth or racial cock blocking you can only build houses at a certain minimum value in some areas, or an immigrant or minority cant develop an area because theyre a minority, etc. These parameters just add more layers. Some people have the funds to certainly build a house, but the costs and consents can be astronomical. Sometimes its for safety, like construction site safety and management. Safety does increase cost no doubt. Sometimes its due to speculation. Housing markets in cities in NZ, aussie, Canada, US, UK and most western euro countries, China in its major cities are inflated severely because housing is used as an investment vehicle rather than just a survival commodity. Forget about all the road blocks and points you mentioned, it wont change your decision. If youre smart and buy in a promosing area with good planning, strong community and work availability, great access to recreational areas, the area is safe lots of people around all the time, shops where people can watch your house all day, friendly neighbours and good community and the house is capable of flexible living conditions various pets, future children, can facilitate a large extended family, capable of being fitted for a home office or business etc., then regardless of what the circumstances are on a macro level, the house and plot are likely going to be stable and strong. Not necessarily explode In value, but they will be reliable because the essential tick boxes are there. When it comes to the house itself talk to an architect. They know houses better than anyone else and how to capture the most value out of it. I am an architect myself so I would know. For construction costs talk to builders. If you know none, find some. Get connections. For property value and price you can generally find that yourself as there are more than enough tools available. Real Estate agents are kinda useless these days."

My two cents I earn a salary and part of it goes to your living expenses. This can be rent or mortgage, this imo is no investment advice. Every country or region is different so read about its market conditions but for me it was simple. I paid an amount of rent that was obviously making my landlord profit. For that same amount in mortgage payments, I could buy a bigger house and the big difference is that I dont transfer that amount to my landlord but to me! Minus mortgage interest For me that was just the best logical choice and I live in a overpopulated region that cannot build against the housing demand so imo low risk of a market crash. When I look at my income it becomes a pie chart with expenses, savings and investments. For me this is just a way to spend that expense more wisely. And this time I bought alone so no risk of needing to sell like what happened to me in 2022 when my previous relationship ended. Hope this helps"

And buyingselling a home has a lot of transaction costs, Buying a house only makes sense if you want to live in it for a decade or more. Theres just not enough supply for the demand of housing. And housing isnt really something that you can push out the supply as fast as other products. Theres about 1.3 Million housing starts per month. The amount of construction is highly correlated to the price of housing. I am constantly hearing how large corporations are buying up large swaths of single family homes and renting them out. So are there even going to be homes to buy if I keep waiting? Or will I be a subject to a landlord forever? This is quite overblown. I am not a xenophobic I myself am an immigrant, but I do worry about the very high numbers new migrants coming to the US. Like I believe a few years ago under another administration I read that if borders cross got over 1,000 a day it would be a national emergency, I believe a few months back it crossed 3,000. Again, as an immigrant myself I know quite a few people like that, I know how hard theyre willing to work and how much more theyre willing to struggle. I know guys that work like 20 hours a day and share a small apartment with like 8 other people. I cant compete with that. Eventually once they get their papers, theyre going to be looking for a house too. So demand is just going to keep increasing. This is also overblown. Illegal Immigrants arent going to buy homes, they will generally rent. Sometimes Ill hear that maybe this housing bubble will burst. Almost every home I look on Zillow around me is quite literally double than what is was prepandemic 20192020. Houses that were 200k, are now 400k. Houses that were 300k are now 600k. The thing is, if this bubble burst, and prices do fall... I know therell be millions of Gen Z that have saved up money to buy a house that will immdeiatly pounce on the opporunity. I know so many friendscollouges that have like 40, 50, 60k in savings just itching to buy a house when prices lower. So if that happens, wont prices just go back up then? Because everyone will just competing to buy the available homes? The amount of people waiting for a bubble to burst are a minority. Most will just buy if they can afford a home and dont think much about if the price is fair."

My mortgage was like 2500 but i received 800 a month from each of my roommates, covering the 1600 interest. In 2022 I got a new job and sold my home for 570k to an ibuyer company. The first 250k in profit is tax free. As a result, I made more money simply sitting in my house for 4 years 200k tax free than I did in 4 years of work. YMMV though. I think if you plan to stay for 5 years and you have a partner or roommates to help split rent, it is always a good idea to have a stake in real estate. Buying near a college is also a decent way to guarantee good roommates. You can simply vet everyone yourself in person and decide who you feel you can trust."

Houses in long run have proven to be good investments, so it is likely a solid financial decision to buy. With that said, they are a highmaintenance investment compared to something like stocks. ACs break, pipes burst, etc. These are all things that lower your roi, and are a pain in the bum. It is undoubtedly true that building equity is better than paying rent tho. Heres how I approached the problem I wanted a house so I could make more money in the long run, so I went out and looked for nice houses with many bedrooms. I made up a metric that was costbedroom, and tried to lower that as much as possible without sacrificing on quality of home. After I bought the house, I moved my friends in with me and they pay me rent. 4 of us in the house 4 bedrooms, I personally pay about 50month of my mortgage out of pocket. Obvi this is good because my cash flow situation is great, but there is risk with this. If my roommates were to leave, I would be on the hook for the full mortgage which is not cheap. The way to minimize this risk is to do a test of ur worst case scenario no roommates, how much are u spending every month in ur budget vs how much do u make. If u can afford to make all the payments and still eat, then ur prob ok. Having this extra income obvi helps in case u lose ur job or something too. Another thing about home ownership is the mortgage interest is tax deductible, so you may get a bit of a refund during tax season depending on ur situation, but if u are collecting rent u will have to pay taxes on that so be careful. obvi liquidity sucks compared to stocks, and u may have to increase size of ur emergency fund if mortgage is what u would pay for rent or something. as for the house itself, try to buy a nice house in a good location ik easier said than done lol but nice placeshomes tend to hold their value and are less volatile. youll have a very hard time selling a house if ur neighborhood sucks. look for a catalyst that will make ur home value go up. For me, I noticed a new homeless shelter was donated by rich people and is being built on other side of town. I live near current shelter, so if I own long enough eventually neighborhood becomes nicer when homeless population is relocated. Your location is of importance in this calculation, especially the housing supply in said location. I wouldnt buy in an area where tons of homes are being built, high supply equal low demand and prices. Its better to go to a neighborhood where all the houses are being fixed up full neighborhood finite supply than it is to go to a new neighborhood supply of houses increasing. last thing, I may be wrong about this dont buy a cookie cutter house. Ifwhen u go to sell it, you will likely be competing against other sellers that have the same house as you, and u will have to get into a price war to sell. Try to buy something unique again, lowers supply. lastly, your age is of concern. If u are young, there is a chance youll get a new job that will relocate you to a new city, and then your house could become a bit of a problem to maintain this is my current predicament. you can sell not what I want to do rn, get a property manager, expensive, I think only really good ones are worth it or try to maintain it yourself time consuming. If u are married andor have kids, I think buying a house makes more sense, for life reasons and because u are more likely to stay in ur city. sorry for rant hope this helps, pls lmk if any questions."

There are some astonishingly ignorant comments that suggest renting is better, but that wont set you up for success longterm. I watched my family rent for 30 years and they still dont own a house at retirement age. That means that even if they had saved properly which they didnt, they guaranteed themselves higher expenses in their old age. Not to mention that they paid someone elses mortgage and more during that 30 years, while the owner got their mortgage paid profit. I bought a house in 2020 smart and lucky and now pay 400 less on a mortgage for a 3 bedroom house than I paid for rent on a 1 bedroom apartment. Im up 100k in equity, and Ill never have to worry about rent getting raised or the owner deciding to sell. My payments will only shrink as I pay down the principal. If I lose my job and Im worried about money, I can rent a room to help offset the cost. If I move, I can rent or sell. Rates drop lower than what Im paying? Refinance. Major repair? Its absorbed by equity and my increased savingsinvestment ability. Meanwhile, I still have money to save, invest, travel, etc. Even more than if I was renting due to the cost difference. Also, this works with current rates too. Just depends where and what you buy. Theres a reason the American any many other nationalities dream includes owning a house. No one scrimps, saves, and slaves at their job with the goal of renting until they die. When you buy is up to you, but thats your best bet for longterm stability and financial agility.

When you find a place you like as a renter, the landlord has the right to increase the cost of rent every year. Unless you want to keep moving your monthly expenses are going to keep going up. Finding a home you love that you can afford can be challenging. I found one in LA back in 2004 and everyone said it was impossible. The home needed repairs but I got these done for under 10K and had a nice, relatively cheap place to live. My equity in my home doubled in 6 months. Fast forward to 2016 when I tried to buy something in a Southern state. I thought this would be simple as prices were cheaper and there was more inventory. It was still tough and the inventory was bought up quickly. I persisted and found a home I could afford. The mortgage was less than my rent in my crummy apartment. The value of my home went up 50 and keeps increasing. It is a matter of deciding what you want to buy, working out what you can afford, and then looking, looking, looking until you find your place. There are some expenses associated with owning a home but knowing you have a place that is yours to do what you wish with is a great feeling."

However being young and united has its benefits. You can take greater risks without effecting others like my familykids. In my 20s I sublet a condo I was living in and lived rent free. I learned about rental contracts and finding roommates on Craigslist still creepy then lol. I bought my first house with my brother and eventually learned how to manage it when we both moved out him out of state. I found a great property manager company and still have the same tenants almost 13 years later. I learned what cash out refinance was and was able to leverage that to continue to build out my portfolio. Also the importance of diversification. Anyways you have so much opportunity for big risks that if a property thats right for you pops up...he should get it with the hopes of subletting and experience...if the numbers work out. However like you said it shouldnt be the top priority if its a majority of your income and theres no opportunities to save."

My landlord is greatbut if he has a major life event divorce, death, illness, etc and the home is sold than my rent will automatically increase about 50 for a smaller space. I will then have to worry about if I can afford rent in the area i need to be in school zones, work commute, etc. Owning a home allows for more stability, more independence, and in most cases equity to at least 3 a year should you have to move and sell. There are benfits to rentingif you know you are gonna move in the next 35 years it may be wiser to rent a cheaper space, smaller space, and less desirable area assuming no kids and dump money into a hysa to prepare for a downpayment when you move. in general buying is better than renting however like any major life decisions it all depends on your specific circumstances. In my case, unless I get fired, I will absolutely be at the same job for the next 13 to 18 yearsso that plus some other specifics on my circumstancesit makes more sense for me to buy. if you decide to keep renting than rent the cheapest place you can afford thats not in a super high crime area and not falling apart and dump as much money as you can in short term high yield savjng accounts and long term roth, sp etc investments."

They were saying it in 2018 when i bought my first house, again in 2021 when i sold for 160 and bought my next house and today when this house is still another 160 off that price. you can wait for things to settle back down but what are you doing in the meantime? paying similar prices in rent without the equity or increase in value? That said, I firmly believe you should only buy a house when you need a house, and there are advantages to renting and being able to move, but i disagree with the wait for things to get better aspect, because there is no guarantee they will."

The math with current interest rates _is_ likely on the side of renting home ownership, but this isnt always the case. My point is that its not quite as cut and dry as Buying a house is exactly the same cost or more expensive than renting over time except that youre locked into a house and cant move freely and can save more money. It is extremely dependent on current interest rates, _where_ you are looking to buy a house, and if you find value outside of pure monetary value in the house itself, how long the term of your mortgage is, etc. etc. For the OP in this thread, I think the answer to should buying a house be my first priority as an investment? is a pretty clear No. Perhaps buying a house should be a first priority in life if thats what brings you joy or comfort, but purely as an investment, no, just shove it in the SP 500 index funds and chill."

Rent where I live and in many other places Ive checked is usually the same amount as a mortgage for the same area after a few years of ownership. For example my house, when applying for a mortgage I also got a rental appraisal done at the banks request. The rent for similar homes in my area was about 5500 a month utilities. My mortgage is 4500 a month utilities, after you factor in property taxes and maintenance it equals out around the same. The only difference was my down payment. If I rented instead and put that down payment into an ETF I would end up way further behind after 25 years. Plus, rent goes up every year. What would that 5500 a month be in 25 years? Cause the mortgage will be paid off."

If I am offering you a generic investment in any asset that is illiquid, opaque, has transaction costs and is complex to sell, has high expenses even if you can estimate them, ties you to a geographical area, is leveraged at a high ratio of your income, is subject to damage from weather or natural disasters, and has low diversification, would you be rushing to buy it? Maybe, maybe not. Im not saying you cannot estimate the costs of a home or that it real estate is always a bad investment.

Production expected in 2028 idk about that. I see an MA on the horizon. the developer in the Athabasca basin thats actually serious and sticks to their timelines is Denison DNNDML. Denison bought uranium on the spot market when things were still recovering. NexGen waited until 2024. Whether the purchase is an investment to hold value, or to hold as future forward deliveries before production ramps up, it was kinda late. Denison plans to sell another few hundred thousand lbs of uranium they mightve already, havent checked in on them since February and keep the rest on hand for forward delivery IIRC. NXE management is just an enigma. has an options chains though so Im certain someone here will get lucky with calls when it inevitably gets bought out."

This is a 37 discount to NAV! In previous high season in the uranium sector that discount to NAV was 15. We are now in the first month of the new high season. In the meantime Nexgen Energy NXE is a large cap where most investors go to when they hear about the uranium sector. NXE share price will increase together with the other uranium company stocks. By consequence Mega uranium acts as a turbo on Nexgen Energy. This isnt financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing Cheers"

Expect big drops of 20 in mid cap stocks and even more in small caps. Within a week. This happens also for the upside like we see this month for a lot of the U equities. That said, there is unbelievable valuation and immense upside to many uranium juniors and business focused on the fuel cycle enrichment etc. This sector moves at a glacial speed, and many stocks do get ahead of themselves. Do lots of homework on companies that are developers of mines. The only producers that need to be considered for a newbie is Cameco, Uranium energy Corp, boss energy and energy fuels. If you want more then look at Sprotts Uranium information on their website. Dont listen to hype on YouTube, X, and other sources. Its a great opportunity to buy a non fungible, scarce and undervalued commodity, but dont expect to make life changing money if you consider yourself an average investor, much of the easy money has been made already in the sitting and waiting. Now is the time to look for value, performance and the companies that are actually going to be able to mine this resources at significant quantities well into the future. Alongside the companies involved in the other services in the sector. This bull market is not a flash in the pan. This time for the nuclear industry, its game on."

On top of that, demand for uranium is expected to grow as China and other nations continue to build nuclear reactors. Prices have been fluctuating, but many experts believe they will rise again due to these supply and demand dynamics. Whats also interesting is how big tech companies are now getting involved. Microsoft recently signed a deal to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power its data centers, while Oracle is building small modular reactors SMRs to fuel its AI data centers. These reactors are expected to deliver over 1 gigawatt of electricity, showing just how critical energy demand has become in powering AI growth. This could lead to even higher demand."

Most of the shortterm money is going to be made by individuals and juniors making claims and working them into good prospects to sell to majors or create a JV. Basically, folks in the industry. Some majors are doing exploration, but Im usually not impressed with their ability to attract and retain top talent needed for good greenfields exploration Theres a reason why geologists work contract to contract. Personally, Im more excited by DoE funded research on converting tailings. All of your cost is in processing ore thats already dug up, and the potential for government funding is huge if you can clean up an area with historic minerelated hazards. Whoever is able to get that first contract in with clear buyin from the government and a new processing technique will cause a new gold rush."

This decays into Protactinium233, which further decays into Uranium233. Protactinium233 can be removed from the liquid salt of a tworegion MSR by reductive extraction into liquid bismuth. Basically a breeder reactor that uses a cheaper and more abundant fuel source. This style of reactor was designed in the 1950s and I honestly believe the main reason this hasnt been developed further is more due to proliferation risks than cost or feasibility. Since the Protactinium233 can be extracted rather easily and would be of high concentration, it would reduce a lot of the work needed to make a nuclear weapon. Mainly removal of neutron emitters and other purification steps to get to 95 purity of Uranium233. Uranium233 is a fissile isotope."

Sure theres a nuclear renaissance currently ongoing but micro reactors are micro e.g. small meaning less required fuel and many are far from being deployed in the coming years. If mines are actually going to reopen then its more than reasonable to assume that theyll open in time before demand surges. Also historically the price of uranium varies between 20120 and this isnt the first time weve had a nuclear renaissance. Realistically, we have near infinite uranium on earth. In the worst case scenario, we can take uranium from the ocean and power the world with that for millions of years."

                    "text": "TL,DR from ChatGPT Summary Uranium Market Report Price Trends Since 2020, uranium prices have surged from 21lb to 106lb in February 2024, currently stabilizing at 83lb. The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected. Uranium Overview Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U238 used in military applications and U235 used to fuel nuclear reactors. U235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal. HALEU and Enrichment Highassay lowenriched uranium HALEU is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives. Supply Challenges Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 1015 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30 by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap. Demand Growth The U.S., China, and France account for 58 of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28 increase in demand from 20232030 and a 51 rise from 20312040, driven by global clean energy goals. Global Production Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43 of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward selfreliance. Investment Insights The report suggests that mining companies are wellpositioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector. Conclusion The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uraniums role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.

Amazon isnt interested in stopping by the gas pumps either. But they announced interest today in building out reactors in three different states to power AI data centers. So this doesnt mean you liquidate your Exxon shares. Just dont shit on market movement that is pretty clear and has the sector running because you didnt notice or dont understand whats going on."

It is not a solution for baseline energy it is a complementary solution to the baseline. Then you fill in with renewables and batteries which can also charge from overproduction of a nuclear facility. Furthermore I think energy production should be more decentralized which reduces the scale of some energy plants and makes it more cost effective. See SMR which china is already starting production of. If we can streamline and make the production of it more efficient itll probably even cost less money than all other energy sources."

If things go to hell, itll be 2008 on steroids because they ran back the same play book with way more money at stake Once tranches of CMBS fail because office space and malls strip malls are dying, other tranches will likely cascade with it. My area has a massive Airbnb bubble right now and they arent being filled. Anymore slowdown in vacationers is gonna be bad because of how many retail people took out HELOCs on inflated properties to buy more homes over list ... rinse wash repeat ... kaboom The big banks ran a similar playbook and retail people with enough borrowing power are pretty majorly over extended in leveraged debt near me.

Where I live, you simply cant just put 20 down and expect to get a mortgage that costs the same as what the rent for that place would be. So my options would be assuming I want to maintain my current standard of living or at least close to it 1 Go back to work while still maintaining my current trading activities in order to double my income, then put 20 down on a condohouse and get a mortgage which with current interest rates is going to be almost double my current rent for the rest. Or 2 Buy a condohouse in cash using all of my savings, and go back to work to fund all of my other expenses and build back up some savings. Either way, Id have to go back to working full time and I have additional financial concerns with both options on top of that. And of course, it was because of renting and rent control that I was able to invest so much of my old salary in the first place, making my current situation possible. Needless to say, there are a lot of factors in my situation that are unique to me personally, but everyone where I live is faced with the issue that buying requires a far higher monthly cash outflow than renting for a comparable place."

In the former case, the US economy will take a serious blow instantly but probably recovers relatively fast, as soon as alternatives are in place, while in the second case the US economy will take a long term serious blow as lots of strategic partners and allies will back off. Nothing is as bad as an unreliable trade partner who betrays its allies and partners. Thats why I wrote in one of the other comments here that it will be a pyrrhic victory at best Intel stock price wont win either way. Add to that that a third big burning pit of instability, a third large war zone including some of the bigger forces in the world or in a region would actually have severe consequences for the whole world economy.

Europe had a huge spike in electricity, gas, and oil prices that its still dealing with today, though between increased US production, a lot more LNG infrastructure, and buying more from places like Azerbaijan hence their feeling empowered to kick Armenians out of their country. The West really did incur a significant cost in moving mountains to completely cut off imports from Russia. And other buyers are finding it more difficult to get those goods no gas pipelines to China currently, Western insurance companies wont insure Russian oil tankers, etc and are also receiving huge discounts because Russia has few buyers. Its probably not possible to cut off China as much as Russia was, but there are all sorts of levers that the OECD has available, and the counties most affected likely Japan and South Korea are heavily incentivized to bear the cost of cutting off China, just like Poland, Germany, the Baltic countries, and others were to cut off Russia. The Chinese economy is currently very fragile, and its political system is very brittle, so it wouldnt take a lot to send the country into crisis. China has been buzzing Taiwan with planes for years, and definitely could bomb them back to the Stone Age, but theyve refrained from doing so. What would it gain from leveling Taipei vs what would the world reaction be to a major world city being obliterated? China would gain the instant undying hatred of all of Asia, and for no real benefit. TSMC is building fabs in Arizona, Dresden, and Kumamoto, but the majority of its production, and all of the most advanced nodes, are still in Taiwan. The Silicon Shield isnt going anywhere. And chips are very transportable, so worldwide shortages would increase prices in the US, even if enough chips were made in the US for American market needs."

E.g., taking an island here or there and literally claiming almost the entire South China Sea and militarily fortifying it with dozens of strategically placed artificial islands. You underestimate how scary Xi is because unlikely his predecessors, he has shown to be willing to tank Chinas economy for ideological e.g., Covid lockdowns a full 18months after everywhere else in the world stopped or political e.g., support Russia in their Ukrainian War purposes. And furthermore, unlike his predecessors, he has almost complete control of the CCP by wiping out nearly everyone that does not support him even exPresident Hu got very publicly and unceremonially removed. And militarily, I doubt there is any active US general that would bet Taiwan winning over a Chinese invasion without significant and lightningfast US and Japanese naval and air support. The Ukraine War has shown the significant deficiencies with Western Arms e.g., precision missiles that are extremely expensive and slow to produce with maybe a month of stockpiles. With an authoritarian government, you just need to outlast a democracyrepublic based one. Look at the Ukraine War lots of support initially that is slowly but steadily dwindling. I cannot imagine the US giving Taiwan more than an elections worth 24 years of support before pulling out because the US economy would also be quite wrecked and there would likely be protests as trillions not the usual billions of of military equipment is expended."

The fundamental problem with your thesis here is your making a macro call and then trying to apply it to a discrete event occurring very shortly. Even if we agreed that theres power concerns, fiscal concerns, concerns with the overall model of AI, concerns about chip manufacturing and ability Its unlikely any of that is on the ballot on the 28th. Whats going to be the concern is revenues for this quarter hitting towards the top end of expectations or exceeding it and then projections for the upcoming quarters Now maybe some of those issues feed into projections but I sort of doubt it. These are longer term problems, so Id be more willing to bet they become an issue over the next 6 to 18 months rather than in 3 days. So its a pretty regarded take to make based on the thesis. TLDR If you want to make a macro AI thesis you should put the time frame for it to play out at longer than 3 days. More like 618 months."

They perform far worst and there are not many libraries available so now you create two problems . The lack of support from libraries creates a difficult where you gonna have to either write your own library which requires time and resources from engineers or use the libraries that are already available but you have to jump through so many hoops to make it work and guess less performance that now you wasted time and money . Lets say you try to hire the top of line engineer most of them already have experience with CUDA , if not its easy enough to learn but if you go anywhere else and try to build in house now you gotta add the time to develop and optimize the library to work as good as a CUDA GPU . So its just cheaper and easier to buy NVidia . Even these big companies like META are buying NVidia .

Youre also basically assuming GPT is the only use of gpus. Youd probably be shocked about the simplistic heuristic models that get implemented and just stick for years. With MLAI you can improve just as an example FedExs routing and pricing efficiency. Historic barriers to entry for a specific horizontal or vertical integration are reduced, allowing more economies of scale. Youre not just saving from the bottom line. Youre adding to the top line. AI still has years before it hits significant diminishing returns. Anyways NVDA has doing some funny stuff with the financial statements imo.

Labor is extremely inefficient so its an easy milestone to cross. Think of the buildings and infrastructure and management required for staff. Then there is all the cars driven to work, all the ACs turned on. All of that is the price of labor and its a lot more than just a salary.

My company have Microsoft CoPilot for engineering to use and nobody touches it If NVDA invests more into AI models beside CUDA similar to OpenAI does, I think they will drive their value much higher. Also most AI models run on CUDA, even if AMDIntel have comparable chips, its a long way to convert these models to nonCUDA."

Then, you are confusing the gamer series blackwell and the datacentre blackwell. You cant compare the two, nvidia no longer cares about gaming and nor should they. They actually see their gaming cards as competition for their far higher margin datacentre cards. The inhouse chips, except for googles, have been quite disappointing so far. Most of them havent been costeffective as compared to nvidias cards even when taking into account nvidias margins, arent as easy to scale, and have no compilers or DL frameworks to use around them. Furthermore, in academics theres no such thing as a known dead end for decades. You cant ever definitively rule out an idea, and thats even more so the case when the eras differ in available compute by a factor of a billion. The claim that gpts cant achieve what you suggest is also fundamentally unproven. I think most ai engineers would agree that just next token prediction is not enough for jarvis, but thats been the consensus for years. However, this does not account for all the efforts put into posttraining like RLHF, and selfconsistency. Now, Im not nearly confident enough to make hard predictions, but at least your reasoning is fundamentally wrong in nearly every aspect."

But GPT read and responded in 5seconds The critique youve provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AIs current trajectory and potential. 1. AI Approaches and Progress The critique dismisses the GPTML approach as a known dead end, but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While its true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fictionlike fantasies e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S., this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT3, GPT4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries. 2. Exponential Investment for Linear Gains The notion of exponential investment for linear gains is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of whats possible. 3. Business Case for AI The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an allencompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decisionmaking, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable. 4. Training Data and Resources Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resourceintensive nature of AI. 5. Nvidias Role While its true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust softwarehardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidias role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete. 6. Investor Expectations The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and longterm potential. In summary, while AIs development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a bubble fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock."

Its kind of like the Tesla story a couple years ago. Company hits scale in a new market, competition emerges and issues start to crop up, so theres a limit to growth upside. But valuations are assuming fairly substantial continued growth. So the upside is minimal and downside risks are elevated.

You are also wrong about improvement costs being completely exponential. That is true for the scaling wide increasing parameter count and training time, but scaling vertically is much more efficient. I use the latest models every day for programming and it seems like every week theres something new that can solve some problems the previous model couldnt solve. The current state of the art is focused on improving training and making a corpus of training data have better results. The gains are spectacular. Microsofts Phi 3.5 mini came out last week and has 3.8B parameters. It outperforms Llama 2 70B from a year ago on benchmarks. Thats almost 20x less parameters and possibly training time. They did this by improving training methodology and making training data higher quality. So methodology is leading to huge improvements. Hyper scale companies are continuing to scale wide AND implement these methodologies. This means each generation is getting better and better and we have a while before we get to scraping the bottom of the barrel of the gains."

You can look up what folks like Sam Altman were saying 5 years ago. Here he is in 2019 openly saying they have no real path to profitability and once we make AI good enough itll just tell us how to make a return. A year ago the entire field was bristling with excitement about AGI and superintelligence, its a relatively recent development that theyve walked expectations back. Theyre just doing the fusion power is 5 years away thing. Heres Sam himself talking down GPT4 2 months before it came out and a couple months ago saying its mildly embarrassing at best and heres him saying largely the same thing nearly 6 years ago The current thing is always good enough for some tasks and the true AGI future is just a few years away. The issue isnt that it takes time, the issue is in 2020 when they released GPT3 theyd raised less than 100m, and today theyve raised over 13B, and they dont have a lot to show for that extra 12.9B. Sams talking about burning 50 billion a year to build AGI and its just got people wondering how many rounds well have to go on this before we get whats actually promised. At the end of the day its not his 50 billion to burn, his company isnt profitable so its gotta come from other people who arent going to keep ponying up if theres no progress to show for it. Obviously the AI sector is bigger than OpenAI, but theyre the best example. True AGI would be worth near infinite investment, but 400B for the current state of AI wasnt worth it, the longer this goes the more investors will just see it as throwing good money after bad."

According to Wikipedia Zarnuqa was depopulated on 2728 May by the Givati Brigade during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War. One account in Al HaMishmar described how a soldier fired with a Sten gun at three people one old man, old woman and a child and how the villagers were taken out from the houses and had to stay in the sun, in hunger and thirst, until they surrendered the weapons they claimed they did not have. They were then expelled towards Yibna. In total, six died and 22 were taken prisoners. The day after, the inhabitants returned and recounted that the Yibna villagers saw them as traitors. The Zarnuqa villagers saw their village being ransacked by Jewish soldiers and nearby settlers. They were expelled again and the houses were demolished the month after.32 The family of the Shaqaqi brothers, Fathi one of the founders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the political scientist Khalil Ibrahim, was from Zarnuqa.33 They fled in the face of rumours of massacres of Palestinians by Yishuv troops and expected to return after the hostilities ended. They were not permitted to come back.5 Haidar Eid, Associate Professor at alAqsa University in Gaza, states that his parent were evicted from the village by members of the Haganah and Stern gang who told them Leave your homes or we will kill and rape you.34"

Every developer in the field uses CUDA, to convince them to switch you have to offer something significantly better. 3. Intel hasnt made a next gen anything since 2009. They were the incumbent leader and they wasted their time reselling the same Sandy Bridge CPUs for years. When AMD finally surpassed them they tried to innovate and failed miserably. This what you are betting on, a failure. Catch up to Nvidia? Are you aware how far ahead Nvidia really is technologically? They can rest for the next 10 years and still be ahead, but they wont since they arent as stupid as Intel was. 4. Yeah lets hope that the government saves our capitalistic assess. We will chant free market afterwards. This is getting old btw and the people are starting to frown upon it. Intel might be made an example of and be nationalised highly unlikely but still as possible as your suggestion. Dont gamble on politics, you will lose. 5. Give money to a retirement community.

The problem the very clever CEOs of these companies have, is if they say yea the business case is very unclear and they try to get off the bus, theyd be punished by the market. Now they will all have to keep spending until they go broke or enough of the market movers see sense, and the companies can stop spending without being punished. Its a classic bubble, because even the clever people cant get out alive. They have to keep playing until something breaks. If you time it, good for you. But bubbles happen, dont take it personally."
