ENPH trades at 108 at time of post and ARRY puts more net income on the bottom line than ENPH currently and ARRY services the utility scale solar sector plus the commercial roof top applications .

For utility level solar, solar farms are proving themselves as reliable and extremely low upkeep cost at the same time as manufacturing them is getting incredibly cheap. Global installed solar capacity has been growing literally exponentially, doubling every 3 years. The more panels that are manufactured, the more economies of scale kick in, and it becomes even cheaper to make, making even not so sunny places cost effective for solar, even in the absence of sufficient grid level storage mechanisms. Which are also developing fast, just not exponentially like solar. In 10 years, solar will be the largest source of electrical power on the planet. Energy produced by them will cost less than half as much as the cheapest electricity to produce today. No politician can deny reality in the long term, as republicans are finding out as people whose homes are destroyed by flooding in the SE US are more likely to believe in climate change regardless of political leaning. Solar is going to be a huge part of the future, and most people dont see it yet. Of course having said this, many of the factors I just named mean that actual margins in the industry will probably go pretty low in the long term, and its going to be essentially impossible to establish a moat. So still hard to pick individual winners."

Almost non existent. \n\nOver the next decade we will see some smr launches but the output of these things are relatively small in terms of megawatt and they are very expensive. \n\nUTILITY-SCALE SOLAR and Wind Power are the two most affordable sources of green energy and of those UTILITY-SCALE scales much more rapidly \n\nThe smr may pose a threat years down the road but I think that thought will stand a strong chance of being dismissed because the adoption of Solar and affordability of same is happening exponentially faster and it&#39;s inexpensive relative to all other options"

Meanwhile NVDA has hit resistance at 140 ( forming what could be a head and shoulder and this would be the right shoulder by the way )  \n\nat any event ARRY will triple next year while NVDA struggles to capture another 20% upside and could see a major sell off as well as people realize the story around NVDA is one of overbought and facing major competition.\n\nI think NVDA at current valuations has priced in the majority of the ai demand at 140.00 , and the multiples have it priced for the next two decades as if no slow down will ever come and i think 2025 will reveal a peak demand moment for NVDA.\n\nI think fomo could see further upside, but it&#39;s limited( I don&#39;t think anyone expects it to have more than another 20% upside)\n\ndownside could be in the range of 75 , if and when peak demand is confirmed .\n\nSo much competition in the ai chip space and other stocks in that same sector offer the chance for larger returns with the launch of their ai chip offerings\n\nNVDA is too dependent on very few customers, and that is a huge red flag in light of the sheer level of competition in the space that has developed now and in light of the various product offerings from the competition.\n\nWhy not rotate into something else at this point ? Perhaps NVDA defies logic , yet again , but i think rotation is the wiser choice at present . I like NVDA a lot but at current valuation i see this as facing a difficult uphill climb to capture the higher price ."

Meanwhile NVDA has hit resistance at 140 ( forming what could be a head and shoulder and this would be the right shoulder by the way )  \n\nat any event ARRY will triple next year while NVDA struggles to capture another 20% upside and could see a major sell off as well as people realize the story around NVDA is one of overbought and facing major competition.\n\nI think NVDA at current valuations has priced in the majority of the ai demand at 140.00 , and the multiples have it priced for the next two decades as if no slow down will ever come and i think 2025 will reveal a peak demand moment for NVDA.\n\nI think fomo could see further upside, but it&#39;s limited( I don&#39;t think anyone expects it to have more than another 20% upside)\n\ndownside could be in the range of 75 , if and when peak demand is confirmed .\n\nSo much competition in the ai chip space and other stocks in that same sector offer the chance for larger returns with the launch of their ai chip offerings\n\nNVDA is too dependent on very few customers, and that is a huge red flag in light of the sheer level of competition in the space that has developed now and in light of the various product offerings from the competition.\n\nWhy not rotate into something else at this point ? Perhaps NVDA defies logic , yet again , but i think rotation is the wiser choice at present . I like NVDA a lot but at current valuation i see this as facing a difficult uphill climb to capture the higher price ."

Our internal view is, as evidenced by some of the news that came out today and the number of congressmen that signed on, republican congressmen that signed on to a letter requesting that the IRA not be defunded and that information came out overnight significant.\n\nJust the fact that over 75% of the benefits from the IRA today are being experienced by republican controlled districts is an incredibly significant statistic. And these are about new jobs, factory openings, high paying solar industry jobs. So we feel that there&#39;s some stickiness to the IRA and certainly to the elements of the IRA related to what we care about within the subset of solar and within manufacturing credits and onshoring of manufacturing in the U.S &#34;\n\n\nwith 75 % of the Ira ( as it relates to solar) going to republican districts,  They are not going to allow the solar  incentives to be eradicated.\n\nI would also point out the Georgia and Texas lead the USA in solar installations. \nFlorida is also ramping up solar installations. \n\nThree red states with large areas of flatland ripe for installs .\n\nI would note that these states led the nation in solar install prior to ira and I don&#39;t see a worry as it relates to IRA .\n\nIra is going no where .\n\np.s this addresses another concern expressed by analyst.\namazing they fail to understand the words uttered in the very conference call they sit in on"

Meanwhile NVDA has hit resistance at 140 ( forming what could be a head and shoulder and this would be the right shoulder by the way )  \n\nat any event ARRY will triple next year while NVDA struggles to capture another 20% upside and could see a major sell off as well as people realize the story around NVDA is one of overbought and facing major competition.\n\nI think NVDA at current valuations has priced in the majority of the ai demand at 140.00 , and the multiples have it priced for the next two decades as if no slow down will ever come and i think 2025 will reveal a peak demand moment for NVDA.\n\nI think fomo could see further upside, but it&#39;s limited( I don&#39;t think anyone expects it to have more than another 20% upside)\n\ndownside could be in the range of 75 , if and when peak demand is confirmed .\n\nSo much competition in the ai chip space and other stocks in that same sector offer the chance for larger returns with the launch of their ai chip offerings\n\nNVDA is too dependent on very few customers, and that is a huge red flag in light of the sheer level of competition in the space that has developed now and in light of the various product offerings from the competition.\n\nWhy not rotate into something else at this point ? Perhaps NVDA defies logic , yet again , but i think rotation is the wiser choice at present . I like NVDA a lot but at current valuation i see this as facing a difficult uphill climb to capture the higher price"

Waiting to see what potential impacts of the election may have on the longer term renewable energy industry. Our internal view is, as evidenced by some of the news that came out today and the number of congressmen that signed on, republican congressmen that signed on to a letter requesting that the IRA not be defunded and that information came out overnight significant. Just the fact that over 75% of the benefits from the IRA today are being experienced by republican controlled districts is an incredibly significant statistic. And these are about new jobs, factory openings, high paying solar industry jobs. So we feel that there&#39;s some stickiness to the IRA and certainly to the elements of the IRA related to what we care about within the subset of solar and within manufacturing credits and onshoring of manufacturing in the U.S &#34; with 75 % of the Ira ( as it relates to solar) going to republican districts, They are not going to allow the solar incentives to be eradicated. I would also point out the Georgia and Texas lead the USA in solar"

Simply put , the market rally will broaden out into small caps with solid fundamentals.This is why you see me reference the Piotroski score a lot and especially so when doing fundamental analysis ( due diligence in front of entry )  The Piotroski score automatically tells you if the company is showing improvement year over year .if it is and you see a sequential quarter over quarter improvement in the financials and a low forward pe and healthy backlog ( ARRY has all of this ) then you are looking at a company ready to appreciate in share price .      A little more due diligence  i could expound on but the bulk of the homework is done for you in those first few criteria i have said ARRY is going to move up for several years and i have made the case in numerous post below since the call to go long September 10th . I like what i am seeing with respect to the chart formation ( revealing a bottom formation with nice slow incline and accumulation )If you buy , do not set stop losses and be prepared to dca down if necessary but this most likely heads much higher over timeUsta586"

This addition would be 55% more added capacity than the 40.4 GW added in 2023 (the most since 2003) and points to a continued rise in industry activity. We expect solar to account for the largest share of new capacity in 2024, at 58%, followed by battery storage, at 23%. Solar. We expect a record addition of utility-scale solar in 2024 if the scheduled 36.4 GW are added to the grid. This growth would almost double last year’s 18.4 GW increase, which was itself a record for annual utility-scale solar installation in the United States. As the effects of supply chain challenges and trade restrictions ease, solar continues to outpace capacity additions from other generating resources. More than half of the new utility-scale solar capacity is planned for three states: Texas (35%), California (10%), and Florida (6%). &#34; source EIAutility scale solar will grow at a 26% cagr ARRY will be a big part of that"

That account was later banned for plagiarizing articles and attempting to sell his plagiarized articles and then Usta 586 magically appeared. Ask Alec, he&#39;ll confirm since he&#39;s been pumping this garbage since then as well.\n\nTikki Masala eating Gagan got caught in a lie trying to gain your cred that he got in on Sept 10 😂"

This addition would be 55% more added capacity than the 40.4 GW added in 2023 (the most since 2003) and points to a continued rise in industry activity. We expect solar to account for the largest share of new capacity in 2024, at 58%, followed by battery storage, at 23%.\nSolar. We expect a record addition of utility-scale solar in 2024 if the scheduled 36.4 GW are added to the grid. This growth would almost double last year’s 18.4 GW increase, which was itself a record for annual utility-scale solar installation in the United States. As the effects of supply chain challenges and trade restrictions ease, solar continues to outpace capacity additions from other generating resources.\nMore than half of the new utility-scale solar capacity is planned for three states: Texas (35%), California (10%), and Florida (6%). &#34;\n\nsource EIA"

This growth would almost double last year’s 18.4 GW increase, which was itself a record for annual utility-scale solar installation in the United States. As the effects of supply chain challenges and trade restrictions ease, solar continues to outpace capacity additions from other generating resources.\n\n\n Wind. Operators report another 8.2 GW of wind capacity is scheduled to come on line in 2024. Following the record additions of more than 14.0 GW in both 2020 and 2021, wind capacity additions have slowed in the last two years.\nTwo large offshore wind plants scheduled to come on line this year are the 800-MW Vineyard Wind 1 off the coast of Massachusetts and the 130-MW South Fork Wind off the coast of New York. South Fork Wind, which developers expected to begin commercial operation last year, is now scheduled to come on line in March 2024.\n\nNatural gas. For 2024, developers report 2.5 GW in planned natural gas capacity additions, the least new natural gas capacity in 25 years.\n\n\nNuclear. Start-up of the fourth reactor (1.1 GW) at Georgia’s Vogtle nuclear power plant, originally scheduled for last year, has moved to March 2024. Vogtle Unit 3 began commercial operation at the end of July last year.\nsource EIA"

Not only that, NXT has two acquisitions that they have to assimilate - whereas ARRY has done that, and now Arrays acquisition is accretive to earnings .\n\nSo, in the near term, NXT will be more constrained going forward than ARRY \n\nmoreoever, ARRY has the new state of the art hail tracker coming out, which will set a new standard in the industry.\n\nSo stay short, but be forewarned .

Not only that, NXT has two acquisitions that they have to assimilate - whereas ARRY has done that, and now Arrays acquisition is accretive to earnings .\n\nSo, in the near term, NXT will be more constrained going forward than ARRY \n\nmoreoever, ARRY has the new state of the art hail tracker coming out, which will set a new standard in the industry.\n\nSo stay short, but be forewarned .

It has been under accumulation of late but still thinly followed.\nTwo years ago, the fed was raising rates and one and a half years ago NEM 3 was written.\nanyone with a modicum of common sense would have not invested in solar at that point.\nToday is a new day in essence .Rates are coming down , solar companies have adjusted to NEM 3 and solar companies are showing sequential top line and bottom line growth again.\nAnyone bragging about shorting 2 years ago is simply saying, &#34; hey i was right &#34;\nanyone not going long now is saying &#34; Hey , am i still right ? Solar stocks are rebounding . &#34;\nif you think solar will not go higher- then you don&#39;t understand the moment.\ntwo years ago in October i said i thought semis were oversold and i took a lot of heat for saying that.\nA couple of weeks ago , on September 10th i said solars were oversold.\nNo one wants to buy a stock when its on sale but all will trip over themselves to jump in after it has doubled.\nit still early , as the next few years should see the solar sector outperform.\none of my suggestions is ARRY\nit is putting more free cash flow on the bottom line than both ENPH which trades at 100 plus and FSLR which trades at over 200 a share and ARRY trades at 6 currently .\nMr market let a diamond slip through the cracks with ARRY \n\nPS. Very few understand that ARRY  has the highest Piotroski score in the sector.\n\nFwiw, the Alt Z score is the third highest.\n\nit also has the lowest wacc of the peers mentioned FSLR,ENPH ,NXT\n\nThe Piotroski score is a financial performance indicator. \nessentially, it is telling us ARRY has the best financial performance in the sector.\nAnd ARRY is putting more free cash flow on the bottom line than FSLR and ENPH\n\nARRY will one day be a 50 dollar stock minimum"

This addition would be 55% more added capacity than the 40.4 GW added in 2023 (the most since 2003) and points to a continued rise in industry activity. We expect solar to account for the largest share of new capacity in 2024, at 58%, followed by battery storage, at 23%.Solar. We expect a record addition of utility-scale solar in 2024 if the scheduled 36.4 GW are added to the grid. This growth would almost double last year’s 18.4 GW increase, which was itself a record for annual utility-scale solar installation in the United States. As the effects of supply chain challenges and trade restrictions ease, solar continues to outpace capacity additions from other generating resources.More than half of the new utility-scale solar capacity is planned for three states: Texas (35%), California (10%), and Florida (6%). &#34;source EIA"

I&#39;ll start off with some key industry highlights, then Neil Manning, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operating highlights for the quarter. I&#39;ll then return and cover the second quarter financial highlights and full year financial guidance,&#34;&#34; We achieved $256 million of revenue, slightly above the high end of the range we provided on our last earnings call. Adjusted gross margin came in at 35%, which included incremental 45X benefits through June 30, 2024,&#34;&#34; Moving on to the latest 2024 market dynamics, we achieved strong new bookings of $429 million within the second quarter.&#34;&#34; Finally, we delivered $55.4 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 21.7% of revenue, and we generated $1.8 million of free cash flow to end the quarter with a strong cash balance of $282 million. &#34;I share this with you all and its taken from the recent Q2 2024 conference call.We are in great shape and 80% of our original 2 billion back log is scheduled to start shipping in 2025There is some seasonality in this business ( as in all business ) and guidance for next quarter suggest revenues will not be as strong as last quarter and that was explained but they will still post a very profitable quarter .Right now , as evidenced by the best Piotroski score in the industry , it is clear that this company will do very well."

Waiting to see what potential impacts of the election may have on the longer term renewable energy industry. Our internal view is, as evidenced by some of the news that came out today and the number of congressmen that signed on, republican congressmen that signed on to a letter requesting that the IRA not be defunded and that information came out overnight significant.\n\nJust the fact that over 75% of the benefits from the IRA today are being experienced by republican controlled districts is an incredibly significant statistic. And these are about new jobs, factory openings, high paying solar industry jobs. So we feel that there&#39;s some stickiness to the IRA and certainly to the elements of the IRA related to what we care about within the subset of solar and within manufacturing credits and onshoring of manufacturing in the U.S &#34;\n\n\nwith 75 % of the Ira ( as it relates to solar) going to republican districts,  They are not going to allow the solar  incentives to be eradicated.\n\nI would also point out the Georgia and Texas lead the USA in solar installations. \nFlorida is also ramping up solar installations. \n\nThree red states with large areas of flatland ripe for installs .\n\nI would note that these states led the nation in solar install prior to ira and I don&#39;t see a worry as it relates to IRA .\n\nIra is going no where ."
