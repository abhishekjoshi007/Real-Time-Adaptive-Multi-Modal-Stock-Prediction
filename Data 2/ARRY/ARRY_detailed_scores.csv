Reddit,2024-09-13,"This is only true for home solutions, which is more politically sensitive. For utility level solar, solar farms are proving themselves as reliable and extremely low upkeep cost at the same time as manufacturing them is getting incredibly cheap. Global installed solar capacity has been growing literally exponentially, doubling every 3 years. The more panels that are manufactured, the more economies of scale kick in, and it becomes even cheaper to make, making even not so sunny places cost effective for solar, even in the absence of sufficient grid level storage mechanisms. Which are also developing fast, just not exponentially like solar. In 10 years, solar will be the largest source of electrical power on the planet. Energy produced by them will cost less than half as much as the cheapest electricity to produce today. No politician can deny reality in the long term, as republicans are finding out as people whose homes are destroyed by flooding in the SE US are more likely to believe in climate change regardless of political leaning. Solar is going to be a huge part of the future, and most people dont see it yet. Of course having said this, many of the factors I just named mean that actual margins in the industry will probably go pretty low in the long term, and its going to be essentially impossible to establish a moat. So still hard to pick individual winners.",Positive,1,0.9978207349777222,Reply

Even that little run up in the last hour of September shouldn&#39;t really count. you can&#39;t call a reversal trend based on a hypothetical 52 week high being in the past or near future &#34;

this was Usta 316 comment directed at me over on the SOXS board and it is still there 

notice he calls me usta . That&#39;s because I am Usta and my profile matches my ID 

SOXS fell off a cliff after this comment from him 

 and that is why he has spent the last two years trolling me . 
Notice he has several troll accounts with some form of the word Usta in the profile 

right now I can see 3  different accounts that he&#39;s trolling me with and I am sure he will come up with others.

Usta 221 , Usta 316, Usta 785 
and then I can see several more he has cloned on this board and the VXUS board 

He&#39;s holding 900 dollar soxs shares and his problem with me stems from me telling him I think it&#39;s time to sell SOXS back then and he refused to do so .

The sad thing is I told him to buy ARRY on September 10th 2024 ar 5.60

Yahoo,2024-10-22,"The nuclear &#34; hype &#34; surrounding Small Module Nuclear &#34; reactors falls on its face when reality sets in .


&#34; As of June 2024, three small modular reactors (SMRs) are operational:
HTR-PM: A 210 MW high-temperature gas-cooled modular pebble bed reactor in China
KLT-40S: A 70 MW reactor in Russia used in the Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plant
HTR-10: A 2.5 MW reactor in China &#34;
furthermore here is the balance of the story with respect to SMR&#39;s
&#34; There are over 80 SMR designs and concepts in development around the world.
The US leads in announced SMR projects, with nearly 4 GW.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the US has a lengthy regulatory process, which is one reason why there are no SMRs running in the US yet. &#34;


The USA does have a fleet of Submarines that are nuclear powered so the technology does work but it&#39;s nascent with respect to land based  smr applications. Almost non existent. 

Over the next decade we will see some smr launches but the output of these things are relatively small in terms of megawatt and they are very expensive. 

UTILITY-SCALE SOLAR and Wind Power are the two most affordable sources of green energy and of those UTILITY-SCALE scales much more rapidly 

The smr may pose a threat years down the road but I think that thought will stand a strong chance of being dismissed because the adoption of Solar and affordability of same is happening exponentially faster and it&#39;s inexpensive relative to all other options",Neutral,0,0.9968352913856506,Main

&#34;I think there&#39;s some holdup waiting to see. Waiting to see what potential impacts of the election may have on the longer term renewable energy industry. Our internal view is, as evidenced by some of the news that came out today and the number of congressmen that signed on, republican congressmen that signed on to a letter requesting that the IRA not be defunded and that information came out overnight significant.

Just the fact that over 75% of the benefits from the IRA today are being experienced by republican controlled districts is an incredibly significant statistic. And these are about new jobs, factory openings, high paying solar industry jobs. So we feel that there&#39;s some stickiness to the IRA and certainly to the elements of the IRA related to what we care about within the subset of solar and within manufacturing credits and onshoring of manufacturing in the U.S &#34;


with 75 % of the Ira ( as it relates to solar) going to republican districts,  They are not going to allow the solar  incentives to be eradicated.

I would also point out the Georgia and Texas lead the USA in solar installations. 
Florida is also ramping up solar installations. 

Three red states with large areas of flatland ripe for installs .

I would note that these states led the nation in solar install prior to ira and I don&#39;t see a worry as it relates to IRA .

Yahoo,2024-10-17,"LOL, the troll has started thumbing up his own post again . Meanwhile NVDA has hit resistance at 140 ( forming what could be a head and shoulder and this would be the right shoulder by the way )  

at any event ARRY will triple next year while NVDA struggles to capture another 20% upside and could see a major sell off as well as people realize the story around NVDA is one of overbought and facing major competition.

I think NVDA at current valuations has priced in the majority of the ai demand at 140.00 , and the multiples have it priced for the next two decades as if no slow down will ever come and i think 2025 will reveal a peak demand moment for NVDA.

I think fomo could see further upside, but it&#39;s limited( I don&#39;t think anyone expects it to have more than another 20% upside)

downside could be in the range of 75 , if and when peak demand is confirmed .

So much competition in the ai chip space and other stocks in that same sector offer the chance for larger returns with the launch of their ai chip offerings

NVDA is too dependent on very few customers, and that is a huge red flag in light of the sheer level of competition in the space that has developed now and in light of the various product offerings from the competition.

Why not rotate into something else at this point ? Perhaps NVDA defies logic , yet again , but i think rotation is the wiser choice at present . I like NVDA a lot but at current valuation i see this as facing a difficult uphill climb to capture the higher price",Positive,1,0.6039273738861084,Main

Two years ago, the fed was raising rates and one and a half years ago NEM 3 was written.
anyone with a modicum of common sense would have not invested in solar at that point.
Today is a new day in essence .Rates are coming down , solar companies have adjusted to NEM 3 and solar companies are showing sequential top line and bottom line growth again.
Anyone bragging about shorting 2 years ago is simply saying, &#34; hey i was right &#34;
anyone not going long now is saying &#34; Hey , am i still right ? Solar stocks are rebounding . &#34;
if you think solar will not go higher- then you don&#39;t understand the moment.
two years ago in October i said i thought semis were oversold and i took a lot of heat for saying that.
A couple of weeks ago , on September 10th i said solars were oversold.
No one wants to buy a stock when its on sale but all will trip over themselves to jump in after it has doubled.
it still early , as the next few years should see the solar sector outperform.

it is putting more free cash flow on the bottom line than both ENPH which trades at 100 plus and FSLR which trades at over 200 a share and ARRY trades at 6 currently .

Fwiw, the Alt Z score is the third highest.

it also has the lowest wacc of the peers mentioned FSLR,ENPH ,NXT

&#34;I think there&#39;s some holdup waiting to see. Waiting to see what potential impacts of the election may have on the longer term renewable energy industry. Our internal view is, as evidenced by some of the news that came out today and the number of congressmen that signed on, republican congressmen that signed on to a letter requesting that the IRA not be defunded and that information came out overnight significant.

Just the fact that over 75% of the benefits from the IRA today are being experienced by republican controlled districts is an incredibly significant statistic. And these are about new jobs, factory openings, high paying solar industry jobs. So we feel that there&#39;s some stickiness to the IRA and certainly to the elements of the IRA related to what we care about within the subset of solar and within manufacturing credits and onshoring of manufacturing in the U.S &#34;


with 75 % of the Ira ( as it relates to solar) going to republican districts,  They are not going to allow the solar  incentives to be eradicated.

I would also point out the Georgia and Texas lead the USA in solar installations. 
Florida is also ramping up solar installations.
