As for shorting, I don&#39;t like the concept of betting a company will go in the toilet and people will get fired seems almost kind of evil to me, and I don&#39;t like the unlimited downside or betting against the upward trend of the market. If I get impatient with a stalled market and want to try to make extra money, I prefer dividend capture schemes with very high yielding instruments like closed end funds, BDCs, or even the yieldmax funds. You can either capture the run up to the dividend or dividend itself and hope the recovery is quick. But short a stock. Nope. Never."

But you are forgetting both were down around $130 earlier this year. Do things look better for them now than then. Right now better place to look is chips which are also getting hammered, or Data center plays. Best play right now I think is ASML. Now there is a stock with a Moat.  Hard to lose long term when you get on a monopoly in the most important sector in the world whose Govt loves it as much as Netherland loves ASML.  Next yr will be fantastic  on sale now.  Full disclosure too big a position for me to add to but if you don&#39;t own it Sept or Oct looks like month to back up the truck.  As for me I will probably add to smaller positions in AVGO, ORCL, and or VRT late this month or Oct.  Still too much of the scary season left to chase small dips now though."

Eric shorted ZS at $162.87 &amp; $174 in NOV. 2023.I sold shares in FEB 2024 at $240 &amp; $251. This is the definition of my taking his money. Since I still own ZS shares at $95 and am profitable- explain how he is taking my money. You may have to use your CartoonLand logic."

Pretty funny.  He also bought into ENDO twice and lost twice, with the last one going to zero.He likes to post misinformation and leave out any details that do not further his attacks (see all his posts on my ZS trades).He denies all this like a little boy.  He lives in Florida and most likely is over 70 years old.  He is a weird bird."

She literally had like 10-15 different user names such as captain yru d Bo t doesur time mike mrwong rich and a bunch others.  Eric and I would laugh at her having conversations w herself, etc.   generally jedd trousers was a total deebag to everyone.  I gave her the name trousers because she used the word in an accidentally comical fashion. \n\nSo in sept 2020 jedd trousers announced she was selling all 3,500 shares of GME for $6.18 to $7.53 a share.  And as we all remember within five months, the share price was $480 causing Jed trousers to miss out on a 1.7 million gain.  That was possibly the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in my life and the most deserving punishment a deebag like Jedd trousers could deserve.\n\nNot soon after trousers appeared on the Endo board, using her mike and time handles.  She bought endo at $7.50 and watched it go to zero after ch11.  She was also on ddog buying at 81 selling at 91 then watching it go to $200.  She soon abandoned, Mike, time and other handles and appeared here using Joe, p, a new jedd account and a few others.  \n\nEric and I are just here to laugh at her unintentionalstupidity, like in January when she posted “I’m buying more at $215 using my March Christmas bonus”\n\nShe’s probably the worst timed trader I’ve ever seen.
