I think the stock is essentially a binary bet on the SiC market. I have no idea what the upside is, but Mohawk Valley, from what I understand, is only at approximately 20 capacity and so you can see a scenario where the stock steadily climbs as capacity fills out and unit economics steadily improve. And then if global SiC demand really takes off, then we could be in pump city. But how certain are we that SiC demand will really take off? Do we even know that there will be enough demand to make Mohawk Valley profitable? Thats the binary bet part."

They basically doubled in the last week due to chips funding, but they need to execute. Execution primarily involves filling more orders and reducing CapEx, which they seem set up fairly well to do based on recent transcripts Ive readlistened to. They will have slightly higher manufacturing capabilities at the Mohawk Valley fab than they initially predicted. Overall, I like WOLF because they are the most experienced when it comes to making wafers of size. They are currently transitioning their wafer production from 150 to 200 mm, which is a great sign. On a more qualitative note, when I watch their YouTube podcasts, I feel that they get into the depths of the technology which I appreciate because to me, it shows that the scientists and engineers are leading the company. Other companies will for sure offer SiC in the future, but will they have the highest market share, Im not sure. WOLF is primarily focused on making the wafers, while sum companies focus on wafer production and device development. Only time will tell of course, my recommendation is to look into the tech and prepare for a moderately bumpy ride. After two years I project itll double and be around 3035."

What opportunities are waiting. What do they view as the business growth with 200mm wafers besides the obvious performance enhancement.

Most recently, in August 2024, Daniel Kinzer, the COO and CTO of NVTS sold 150,000.00 shares for a total of 465,000.00. I wonder if Navitas is getting any CHIPS act grants.

I know Wolfspeed is  actually making their crystals in the new JP plant already, but when they grow crystal, do they have to use the Quartz to grow it. This mine is critical to the industry, and they closed on September 26th because of the massive rainfall (they got 24 inches ) and reported half the community is still out of power and roads washed out completely and would possibly take a long time to get things up and running, depends on extent of damage. This is critical for production of semiconductors. So if anyone knows more about this and what it means pertaining to Wolfspeed, they did say most semiconductor plants order 2-3 months in advance supply but if they can&#39;t get the mines up and running for an extended period,  which they expressed the concerns that prices for materials will drive the prices up considerably and also cause a shortage."

Given the heavily deflated market cap, wolf is a good candidate for consolidation.  Reports on hedge fund activists  (jana partners) getting involved?   These folks like to sell companies when they aren&#39;t performing.    I wonder if something is brewing????  just me thinking out loud."

Wolf only caters to the EV market and it’s suffering, competition is growing and prices are being squeezed. I own a bunch of this stock at 20 and I’m not happy with the CEO. He didn’t get any of the government subsidies so he’s obviously not doing the right things. At this point I’m in too deep and plan on buying once next quarter is announced, I think we see 6.00 which should be the bottom. The only out for WOLF is a buyout by one of those larger semiconductor companies, Intel would be a good one. Fingers crossed that EV start selling at a higher rate in 2025."

It can go lower in my opinion but should turn around sometime in 2025. There is no doubt in my mind they will be acquired, will it be at 15.00 or 30.00 will depend on execution and the market. I’m holding my shares with fingers crossed that management figures it out."

Only one of the many different technologies in the oven now and imo going to bring 10 times the revenue in the near future, amongst also a lucrative buy out is possible,  I would think that is Jana&#39;s whole point of being involved. I&#39;m new to this type business and not completely informed but it is my best interpretation of this company that is super shorted and too bad the troops don&#39;t move in like they do on other highly shorted stocks. Need 30 to 40 million + volume spiking this out of control of the hedge fund that is shorting it and it will bankrupt their tails.

That is because the institutions own 112% of the WOLF stock. The hedge fund solution now appears to be keep shorting in an extreme mode until they have forced the price below $5/share. As of August 15 they shorted almost 30% of the float. The shorting has been extreme for the last few weeks so I would expect the short position  is much higher now. It looks like they are  trying to force the institutions to sell because their covenants do not allow them to hold share in a company valued at less than $5/share.It will be intreresting to see what happens when the price is pushed down to around $5/share. Once the hedge(s) achieve their goal of forcing the institutions to sell and their short position is eliminated the price may explode with extreme buying. I may be one of those extreme buyers. This is the way it appears to me. JMHOAnother words all of this shorting may have nothing to do with debt, losses, and other business/market factors that others keep citing."

Perhaps a few institutions will shed a few shares for tax purposes, but I don’t see them liquidating large blocks at these depressed levels especially because the company is forecasting to be profitable in FY26. How bad could it get for the Hedge Funds IF they are forced to cover? Well, if the Institutions continue to hold their shares and only start selling during a squeeze, it would not surprise me to see a 1000%-2000% jump within a few days before settling down around FMV. Many factors are at play right now, so it’s hard to pinpoint when (or IF) a catalyst will trigger such an event/opportunity."

Cash burn could easily stay high given the pre-paid supply commitments, when they deliver and recognize revenue they won&#39;t receive any cash for those pre-paid shipments. And if they have insufficient liquidity to buy product to meet supply commitments, that would be default well before their bonds mature.

Their short position/s keep rising and they desperately need an institutional investor to sell a very large block of shares in order to cover these borrowed shares. At this point, nothing is really stopping them from continuing with this shorting campaign until they find an exit strategy or are forced to cover."

Sure, the company hasn’t helped the situation with a production mishap and not being able to provide a catalyst to reverse the slide. Companies like Wolf can be easy targets for these attacks during growth periods. I’m not sure what the motive is behind the Hedge fund/s aggressive attack on Wolf, but there should be more trading safeguards (and enforcement) in place to protect U.S. companies that are critical to our country. The CHIPS Act demonstrates the importance of semiconductor companies to our country and our future, so if that is the case then protect these companies, protect Wolf! Also, shame on the WS analysts for not taking the time to perform real due diligence on Wolf and properly valuing the business - very lazy and remiss. This should serve as a call to action for those in positions of power to affect change. Further, it appears that the Hedge Fund/s have gotten themselves into a trap and cannot cover their large short positions due to the lack of sellers. This is what happens when you attack a company that doesn’t have enough shares floating around to close out large positions. A desperate Hedge fund that stands to lose billions of dollars is dangerous and may resort to all types of manipulation to find a way out. Pardon the diatribe, but this demands more attention and an investigation!!"

When I sold them the premium was 3.6-5.3% depending on the strike and my execution price. \n\nI&#39;m up about 2% on the trade so far.  I&#39;m probably going to expand my trade in anticipation of earnings. From what I&#39;m seeing on this board I have 2 observations: \n\n1) people should&#39;ve listened to Jamie when Jamie went short.  You all could&#39;ve made a lot of money and then bought more of this company if you still believed in it.  Investing isn&#39;t about you making companies you believe in more wealthy, it&#39;s about you making you more wealthy.  So be agnostic, unemotional, and be willing to play both sides.  Yes it&#39;s simpler to just be a bull, but sometimes being a bull on yourself and your future means being a properly timed bear.\n\n2) This looks like a great trading opportunity for a pop on a &#34;less bad than expected&#34; earnings report.  I fully expect the price action to continue to drift down as we are headed into recession and this looks like a marginal producer at best, but the short interest ratio should fuel a nice short term bounce. Date this price, don&#39;t marry it."

Timing seems suspicious to me. Hopefully the SEC closely monitors these reports to ensure that analysts do not abuse this function to manipulate a stock. What’s even more concerning, to me, is that analysts like this guy have the ability to issue such reports. His track record is basically on par with coin flip odds - around 50%. A restriction should be considered to not allow these failing analysts to publish reports. Should be limited to analysts that have success ratings much higher than 50%. How many other jobs will allow an employee to be right 50% of the time? I’d be interested in knowing if one or more of this guy’s clients hold a large short position. Additionally, how many MS clients did he harm."

Greg took out big loans with the expectation that growth in the EV market would be much greater than it is now and that it would dominate the gas vehicle market.  Well the market let everyone know that gas vehicles are not going away anytime soon so the great demand that was anticipated was greatly reduced.  Now we wait to see how much that reduction is and whether or not the income generated will exceed the outflow of money to support it.  Probably having to refi those big loans at a much higher interest rate didn&#39;t help matters either.  We shall see."

Currently being a high beta stock with over 17% short interest will work to long term investors’ advantage when the tide turns to the upside. An overnight 2x increase is possible with any good news or strong forward guidance. An acquisition could be a 5x jump. Patience will pay off and Wolf will most likely outperform other chip companies like ON over the next two years. Good luck to all."

Fleet sales make up approximately 30-40% of auto sales.  Good time to buy the leader in silicon carbide manufacturing.  Hedge funds and traders do not understand manufacturing.  IMO keep buying.Also the solar industry uses silicon carbide in their inverters.  Solar is the cheapest way to make electricity.  This is a growth market for silicon carbide."

It is a niche market that is pretty much saturated and now has some repeat buyers.  I don&#39;t see much expansion past what the current market is unless their is a significant cost reduction.  One other thing no one mentions is the nearly double the price of insurance for an EV vehicle or the cost or replacing tires every 12 months or less.  You may save 1/3 of what you spend on gas but those 1500.00 dollar tires each year eat that savings up and that is not counting the exorbitant insurance price you have to pay"

Also, the number of chargers needs to grow rapidly, which electric utilities are beginning to increase their exposure.  The chargers have a silicon chip.The fleets will grow their EV commitment due to the lower cost over the life of the vehicle than ICE.   Gas now $ 3.84 per gallon in my area.
