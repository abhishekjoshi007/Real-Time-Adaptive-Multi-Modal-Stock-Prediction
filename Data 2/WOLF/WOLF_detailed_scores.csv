Reddit,2024-10-16,"The press release just says theyre investigating but I assume the allegation is fraud, that the company engaged in some level of pumping at some point. I think the stock is essentially a binary bet on the SiC market. I have no idea what the upside is, but Mohawk Valley, from what I understand, is only at approximately 20 capacity and so you can see a scenario where the stock steadily climbs as capacity fills out and unit economics steadily improve. And then if global SiC demand really takes off, then we could be in pump city. But how certain are we that SiC demand will really take off?

Reddit,2024-10-17,"I love SiC and WOLF, but I think the target within the next 612 months is a little high. Instead, I think 2030 is more reasonable. They basically doubled in the last week due to chips funding, but they need to execute. Execution primarily involves filling more orders and reducing CapEx, which they seem set up fairly well to do based on recent transcripts Ive readlistened to. They will have slightly higher manufacturing capabilities at the Mohawk Valley fab than they initially predicted. Overall, I like WOLF because they are the most experienced when it comes to making wafers of size. They are currently transitioning their wafer production from 150 to 200 mm, which is a great sign. On a more qualitative note, when I watch their YouTube podcasts, I feel that they get into the depths of the technology which I appreciate because to me, it shows that the scientists and engineers are leading the company. Other companies will for sure offer SiC in the future, but will they have the highest market share, Im not sure. WOLF is primarily focused on making the wafers, while sum companies focus on wafer production and device development. Only time will tell of course, my recommendation is to look into the tech and prepare for a moderately bumpy ride.

Further, AMD’s CPU’s and GPU’s could potentially see significant performance improvements making them more competitive to Nvidia. AMD will be TKO’ed If Nvidia makes the first move and acquires Wolf.

Yahoo,2024-09-09,"As is patently obvious, there is one or more hedge funds that have been stuck in an exterme short position for over a decade, which they can&#39;t buy their way out of. That is because the institutions own 112% of the WOLF stock. The hedge fund solution now appears to be keep shorting in an extreme mode until they have forced the price below $5/share. As of August 15 they shorted almost 30% of the float. The shorting has been extreme for the last few weeks so I would expect the short position  is much higher now. It looks like they are  trying to force the institutions to sell because their covenants do not allow them to hold share in a company valued at less than $5/share.It will be intreresting to see what happens when the price is pushed down to around $5/share. Once the hedge(s) achieve their goal of forcing the institutions to sell and their short position is eliminated the price may explode with extreme buying. I may be one of those extreme buyers. This is the way it appears to me.

Yahoo,2024-08-31,More institutions will be buying this stock next week. imo The value investor understands the capital needed to expand and the low stock price and the large amount of orders.  WOLF is a leading producer of SiC. WOLF locked into 800 volt   EV  automobile.  Plus squeezing shorts is always fun.WOLF will have private presentations in NYC with long investors.  Shorts will be left out.The sales growth at the NY plant currently $55-$60MM in the current quarter and ramping up will be a major selling point to NY investors..  Another possibility would be friend ABB could invest in WOLF to lock in their industrial supply.  Lower SiC prices increases the demand if SiC in industrial applications and benefits ABB.,Positive,1,0.7864627838134766,Main

Sure, the company hasn’t helped the situation with a production mishap and not being able to provide a catalyst to reverse the slide. Companies like Wolf can be easy targets for these attacks during growth periods. I’m not sure what the motive is behind the Hedge fund/s aggressive attack on Wolf, but there should be more trading safeguards (and enforcement) in place to protect U.S. companies that are critical to our country. The CHIPS Act demonstrates the importance of semiconductor companies to our country and our future, so if that is the case then protect these companies, protect Wolf! Also, shame on the WS analysts for not taking the time to perform real due diligence on Wolf and properly valuing the business - very lazy and remiss. This should serve as a call to action for those in positions of power to affect change. Further, it appears that the Hedge Fund/s have gotten themselves into a trap and cannot cover their large short positions due to the lack of sellers. This is what happens when you attack a company that doesn’t have enough shares floating around to close out large positions. A desperate Hedge fund that stands to lose billions of dollars is dangerous and may resort to all types of manipulation to find a way out.

A: China. 

The amount of misinformation and lies and FUD and scaremongering that surrounds this stock is ridiculous. The FBI should team up with SEC to make sure this is not all part of a china-engineered propaganda machine designed to hurt americas onshoring agenda. The chinese russians and north koreans love engaging in this economic sabotage and we fall for it.

I&#39;m up about 2% on the trade so far.  I&#39;m probably going to expand my trade in anticipation of earnings. From what I&#39;m seeing on this board I have 2 observations: 

1) people should&#39;ve listened to Jamie when Jamie went short.  You all could&#39;ve made a lot of money and then bought more of this company if you still believed in it.  Investing isn&#39;t about you making companies you believe in more wealthy, it&#39;s about you making you more wealthy.  So be agnostic, unemotional, and be willing to play both sides.  Yes it&#39;s simpler to just be a bull, but sometimes being a bull on yourself and your future means being a properly timed bear.

2) This looks like a great trading opportunity for a pop on a &#34;less bad than expected&#34; earnings report.  I fully expect the price action to continue to drift down as we are headed into recession and this looks like a marginal producer at best, but the short interest ratio should fuel a nice short term bounce.

I was surprised to see it go sub 12.00 but don&#39;t think for a moment that it can&#39;t go lower.  The earnings and guidance will tell the story of how well or how bad they are doing as a company.  Greg took out big loans with the expectation that growth in the EV market would be much greater than it is now and that it would dominate the gas vehicle market.  Well the market let everyone know that gas vehicles are not going away anytime soon so the great demand that was anticipated was greatly reduced.  Now we wait to see how much that reduction is and whether or not the income generated will exceed the outflow of money to support it.

Wolf has certainly gone through some growing pains recently, but once the plants are operating at full capacity the stock price will improve significantly. Currently being a high beta stock with over 17% short interest will work to long term investors’ advantage when the tide turns to the upside.
