Reddit,2024-08-01,"Your table is missing a key piece of data, analysts usually give 12 month price targets, so how accurate did the analysts price turn out to be 12 months later? Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks.",Neutral,0,0.6505180597305298,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,Ill be honest its really not. I came to knowast year that NVDA was priced above 700 pre split but I was scared and only invested in QQQM. It then crossed 1000. I read about analyst ratings about ISRG. I invested a small amount after some research. It has gone 20 since then and has been solid despite tech sell off. I think analyst ratings is helpful to screen companies and not go tits up.

I still invested because I follow the company and think there is a significant upside and current analyst opinions are recency bias. So I believe analyst opinions are a piece of information.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"There are all kinds of wild valuations being tossed around, personally I can see another 10ish spike after launch and unfurling of the satellites. All price models are based on carrier revenue and profit spits and havent accounted for any military or DOD contracts. The below post is not my own, but from another user in the AST sub How could we get to 1000 a share... Lets say there are 300 million shares, so we need a market cap of 300B. Thats a big company. To be valued at a 300B company, lets assume our PE. ATT is about an 11, Verizon is a 15, but American Tower is a 40x PE. Lets pick an arbitrary 20xPE since its conservative and favoring the carriers and not the growth of AMT. That means we need earnings of 15B. AST assumes they will have higher than 95 margins, lets assume 90. So we need revenues of 16.6B. Roughly 1.4B a month. Assuming we are getting 2 a month per customer, we need 700 million subscribers. Our current MNO list with MOUs covers 2.7B cell users. So we need 26 of them to utilize the service. ATT market research says 3040 of people would be willing to pay for this additional coverage, so there could be potential upside. Dont say that 1000 is impossible without understanding the opportunity. This doesnt even include what the US government is going to pay for us to be able to track stealth aircraft anywhere in the world... Conversely, the SP may not fly, but consider that American Tower pays an annual divided of almost 7 a share. If the free cash flow estimates are correct for AST, should they choose to offer dividends it could go brrrrrrrrrrr",Neutral,0,0.9992173910140991,Reply

I couldnt justify 300mo for the volume and percentage of commercials I was forced to watch on live TV. My first streaming device was my Wii console and ultimately moved to Roku. Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to.
