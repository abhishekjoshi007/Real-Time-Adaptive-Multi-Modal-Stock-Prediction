Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks."

Buyers probably have enough supply on site to weather the storm. This shouldnt be anything like when there was a fire in the 2000s that crippled production for months. Worst case scenario, one of the mines has an airstrip. Its not big, mostly used to fly in the wealthy european owners, but maybe it could be use to move a barrel or two."

What tourism spruce pine had is gonna be gone for a while. On the HPQ side, the mines are fine, the production is fine, but transportation is still iffy and you might see some job openings as people had some major damage done to their homes and downtown. That said, it wont be easy for locals to get a better paying job in the area, and a lot of people that live up there will swear up and down that they couldnt live anywhere else. This isnt financial advice, but as I see it this is a couple weeks of disruption to production, followed by a period of time that has more challenging and expensive shipping small truck over rail.

All price models are based on carrier revenue and profit spits and havent accounted for any military or DOD contracts. The below post is not my own, but from another user in the AST sub How could we get to 1000 a share... Lets say there are 300 million shares, so we need a market cap of 300B. Thats a big company. To be valued at a 300B company, lets assume our PE. ATT is about an 11, Verizon is a 15, but American Tower is a 40x PE. Lets pick an arbitrary 20xPE since its conservative and favoring the carriers and not the growth of AMT. That means we need earnings of 15B. AST assumes they will have higher than 95 margins, lets assume 90. So we need revenues of 16.6B. Roughly 1.4B a month. Assuming we are getting 2 a month per customer, we need 700 million subscribers. Our current MNO list with MOUs covers 2.7B cell users. So we need 26 of them to utilize the service. ATT market research says 3040 of people would be willing to pay for this additional coverage, so there could be potential upside. Dont say that 1000 is impossible without understanding the opportunity. This doesnt even include what the US government is going to pay for us to be able to track stealth aircraft anywhere in the world... Conversely, the SP may not fly, but consider that American Tower pays an annual divided of almost 7 a share. If the free cash flow estimates are correct for AST, should they choose to offer dividends it could go brrrrrrrrrrr"

Interest rates on mortgages have been high so return is dwindling here we renegotiate mortgages every 15years lastly the government where I live has changed a number of rules further penalizing landlords, no Air BnB, much higher capital gains tax on non primary residence, 5 months notice of eviction.

Sometimes the provenance of doom is clear, other times self inflicted IV crush due to your poorly thought out trade idea. Other times expectations are defied because a nut fell on a car 2000 miles from the CBoE and that caused an analyst to miss a meeting and now everyone thinks grain futures are fucked. Sacrifice your chicken and try to pierce the veil of the future, neophyte. Remember, deals with extraplanar beings from the Black Rock always carry conditions you may find... unpleasant.

Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to. When you get used to watching what you want without constant commercial interruptions, it becomes very difficult and annoying to watch commercials every few minutes. At least for me."
