Reddit,2024-09-02,"Well, you get it! Thats the problem now, because inventory X is now mathematically depleted. That inventory X was used to fill the supply gap in 2018 2H2023. In 2H2023 the market started to feel the impact of the nearing depletion of that inventory X. Now that annual global supply gap has to be filled with a lot of new production, but production is always lower than they hope Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano and new production starts are postponed because it is really hard to start a new mine. And even the remaining small uranium mines in careandmaintenance and DASA and Phoenix start producing uranium, even then the global uranium supply deficit will not be solved.... In fact the nuclear sector and uranium sector have been taken by surprise by the unexpected massive licence extensions of existing reactors and the ramp up of construction of new reactors by China, India, ... Where can those uranium producers go now to get they uranium they need to be able to honor their supply commitments to clients? a They can knock on the door of Denison Mines 2.2Mlb, Uranium Energy Corp 0,5Mlb and Uranium Royalty Corp small part of their uranium is uranium of the past, but the main part is uranium they get from uranium production today streamings, so that will not solve the uranium production problem, because its part of it.... But they will not sell it at current uranium spotprice, and it only represents a couple weeks of the annual supply gap. So insufficient to solve the supply problem. b From the known uranium spotsellers Uranium One, Olympic Dam, Sopamin, Navoi through 2 trading firms in Japan and Namibia JV partner. BUT this is all uranium from CURRENT production. You cant solve a supply gap due to lower current global uranium production than the anual consumption with uranium from that same current uranium production! The only uranium that could close that gap was uranium of the past, meaning that inventory X that is depleted now. The more Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano buy from Uranium One, Olympic Dam, Sopamin, Navoi and Namibia JV Partner, the less utilities will be able to buy from them. This will add 0 lbs of uranium to the supply problem! c Imo, the last option is that utilities start to buy as much shares of the 2 physical uranium funds as possible to be able to, but this would push those 2 uranium funds significantly higher. But the uranium sectors take already a big part of the freefloat of those 2 physical uranium funds. So it would actually mean the utilities will have to buy almost all remaining shares of those 2 physical uranium funds held by retail investorshedge funds. One of the reasons why Im also invested in those 2 physical uranium funds today This isnt financial advice.

Why? The annual uranium consumption of 450,000 lb is 13 of an entire core. Each time a reactor is shutdown for refueling, only 13 of the reactor is replaced, namely 450,000lb. In the meantime China only has 5Mlby domestic uranium production By consequence, those 600 million lbs of uranium, you are mentioning, are only 6 year of consumption held as a strategic inventory in case of western sanction in a possible cold ware between USA and China the needed uranium for the first cores.

The USA, Europe, ... only look 5, maybe 10 years ahead, but not on the level of uranium supply. China will not have a supply problem, the rest of the world will.

The only recurrent expense is the storage cost of the uranium held at a few places A fuel buyer, Per Jander, that buys uranium for utilities, producers, also buys the uranium for Sprott Physical Uranium Trust. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust fee Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is a closedend trust. Their internal rules dont allow them to sell uranium. But of course at a certain point in time those rules could be changed through a shareholders voting. Imo how this will finally play out in the future not 2 months from now, more talking LT here To change the internal rules to be able to sell uranium the shareholders need to want to sell that uranium. And when is that going to happen? When utilities bought so much shares of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust that they have a majority to change the internal rules. But to do so, they first have to buy a lot of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust shares what will push the share price significantly higher first, pushing the share price above NAV which will trigger the uranium spotbuying from Sprott Physical Uranium Trust.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"If you make a plan stick to it. Being wrong with a plan surprisingly hurts less than not going through and being proven right later. Use stop losses. Options have a great natural stop loss in that they cant go negative unlike other leveraged derivatives. I know its heresy but maybe dont go all in on every move. Always have free money to hedge if the need arises. If what youre doing isnt working out try something else. Different underlying, different instrument, different timeframe. If youre starting off thinking youll be the next master cryptoforex trader just donate all your money now and save yourself the grief. And most importantly since were all doing options here Never buy an option that expires exactly when you expect a movement to happen. Expecting goodbad news on a company? Feeling like a fed announcement or a world event will affect the market? Playing earnings or other major announcements? Take the time between now and the event, the time youre expecting the movement to actually happen, then double it for long term plays and triple it for shorter term plays 2 months. That way your contract is still not getting shredded by theta when the expected move happens, and if its late, you still have wiggle room. When youre buying a contract expiring on an earnings date a month from now youre just fucking yourself over for no reason. You do not want to be holding options till expiration, you want to get rid of them before the halfway mark ideally. TLDR dont be a regard and yolo on every move, manage position size which serves as a natural stop loss and you might just stay solvent for long enough to actually start making profit.",Neutral,0,0.979427695274353,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-22,Ive had my fumbles early on but every subsequent position gets a bit better. Its one thing to read about how options work but another to see it in practice. Seeing how theta works or how IV crush happens. Im not talking about crunching numbers and looking at graphs you just sort of eye ball it intuitively after a while. I cant for the life of me understand how theres so many people doing the same thing over and over even though its not working and blowing all their money out like that. But I get it. Theyre aiming for 10 baggers. Cant really get those with sensible plays.,Neutral,0,0.9997431635856628,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-22,"I had to take my money out of my brokerage a few months ago to pay for some unexpected expenses that piled up. Two weeks ago I put 200 in, it was 500 in a few days. Took my 200 out. Now its the houses money. Another week and Im at 1500. Most of it was SPY calls and some calls and puts on ASTS that printed. Will probably withdraw again soon because the better Im doing the more regarded I get and blow it. But it shows that even when youre regarded its still possible to start with very little. I did this again in the past with even less money, less than 100, and took it to 800 in a week. It seems that when I have a low account balance Im at the top of my game, so I withdraw often.
