THIS IS WHO KAMALA HARRIS REALLY IS!

The History of Kamala Harris
by Geoffrey B. Higginbotham 
Major General, USMC (Ret.)
  
For your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: 

Kamala Harris&#39; father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris&#39; parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. 

The group&#39;s leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. 

Following her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown&#39;s political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. 

Brown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris&#39; Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris&#39; political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California&#39;s Attorney General. Willie Brown, Jr. w",Neutral,0,0.9999159574508667,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-17,"Here is where we stand with tax policy:Kamala Harris and Biden together stated last winter that they would liketo tax long-term capital gains as &#34;ordinary income&#34;. So, an APP investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects APP the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for APP. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know.
