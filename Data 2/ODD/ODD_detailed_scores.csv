Of course the 40 of shares not held by Trump are in play and those investors will be affected by the outcome. Mods nixed it anyways. OP, I hope your post survives longer.

Reddit,2024-08-28,"Smithson IT wrote this in their Q423 letter about the Oddity It is from a few months ago, but the share price is still around the same level. Oddity is another atypical investment for us but one which we believe has substantial opportunity for growth. It is the first ever IPO we have taken part in, and we did not do so lightly. We got to know the management several months before the IPO as we were approached directly by the company after they had been made aware that the business exhibited much of what we look for in a high quality, growing company. We were extremely impressed by the track record as well as the potential opportunity for the company. Oddity is a beauty and wellness company which creates its own brands and products to sell direct to consumers online. So far, the company has launched two brands, Il Makiage and SpoiledChild, both of which have been the fastest growing online brands in history, and now sell more online than large established beauty brands such as MAC. Traditionally there has been a large knowledge gap between consumers and beauty experts, requiring consumers to interact with a trained salesperson to match the myriad of beauty products to their needs and show them how to apply them at home. The large established cosmetics companies havent so far made strong attempts to sell products to new customers online refill purchases are obviously easier but Oddity has been able to build AI technology using data from their users 1bn datapoints from 40m users to learn how to match the right products to consumers with inputs including online questionnaires and, increasingly, selfie photos. Their 90 skin match accuracy compared to 80 instore equivalent has generated over 4m customers, with more than half of revenue now coming from repeat customers. This is not only a strong indication of the value of their service but is also much more profitable. We expect to see very high annual revenue growth for the next few years as the companys technology is several years ahead of established competitors and addresses such an enormous potential market.",Positive,1,0.9999998807907104,Reply

Honestly, Im still undecided if this is a great opportunity or a dud of a company. Im generally of the opinion that most consumer brands are mostly marketing and hype anyway, so it doesnt concern me for this specific company, though it is a concern broadly. . I also very much doubt their ability to consistently match a foundation via internet. This is a great point. Its one of the things Im still working through on this company.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"At lower prices it was an intriguing bet for some investment firms because of the riskreward proposition. The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"Going to redirect to ChatGPT because it will answer the question in far more detail than I ever could The behavior youre describing aligns with what some people refer to as swing trading, which involves holding a stock for a short period days to weeks to capitalize on expected price movements. Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way.",Neutral,0,0.9998124241828918,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,Odd lot arbitrage actually only really works for retail traders because it only works for small positions. Ie. less than 100 shares. Ive never seen a subreddit that discusses it. Probably because they dont occur very often at least for US stocks. I have seen them for Canadian stocks and Ive played around with 2 or 3. But the way that the taxes work because I am US based doesnt make it particularly efficient. Also there is timing so any arbitrage needs to take into account the current riskfree rate. So whenever Ive tried it at least for me the odd lot arbitrage was basically just capturing the riskfree rate but with a lot of extra steps. Thats the other reason why I stopped bothering with them.,Neutral,0,0.9996521472930908,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-27,"Just to add to greytocs response and a bit more of an explanation of what they are. So generally when a company wants to buy back some of its shares it needs to incentivise shareholders to actually sell them, this would be done by offering to buy back the shares at a premium to where they are currently trading. Lets just pick the numbers shares are trading at 10 and the company offer to buy back shares for 11, a 10 premium. This is a great deal, you want to tender these. So you would want to buy shares to tender them at 11. What normally happens though is that the company will offer to buy back say 10 of their shares outstanding and that is all. What happens if 100 of shareholders try to take the offer to tender their shares? Well they get what is called prorated, where the company looks, sees that 100 of people wanted to tender and says, well we only have 10 to buy so we will buy 110 of everyones tenders. So if you wanted to tender 1,000 shares, they actually only buy 100 back off you. So what happens in practice is that they announce the tender and rather than stock shooting up to 11 a share it actually only jumps to about 10.10 as that is what you can actually get as an average fill on selling it back. these numbers are a large simplification for illustrative purposes to understand the basics, there are a few more things to consider. The oddlot tender provision basically just says anyone who tenders under 100 shares, we will give you priority and buy ALL of you shares first. So you are pretty much guaranteed to receive that 11 amount. Which is nice, as stock is still trading lower because arbitrage pricing wont force it higher as individuals can only buy up to 99 shares. So thats the basics. Its pretty nice when they come around. They are pretty limited in scale as obviously can only work for up to 99 shares in the company so you kindve need a high priced stock and a nice premium offered to make it a significant windfall. They can be nice to collect some free pocket money though if you get in the habit of just doing them with minimal operational overhead. Interest rates and time to return your money is obviously a consideration as greytoc said. Taxes obviously diminish your gains but dont they always and if its a pure arb itd be rude not to. Of course tenders can be withdrawn, updated, collapse etc. so thats a risk but one that tends to be okay to bear. A further complication is that in some of the best ones they are not actually offering to buy back shares with cash but with shares in another company. You will then bear some risk in that equity. Hope this helps.",Neutral,-1,0.9984592497348785,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"I was a scientist in the nuclear industry in the 80s and 90s, its going to be a decade before I retire. Ive worked on reactors, reprocessing and warhead production. In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"The DD is indeed bending reality. In addition to Vogtle 34, there was another project that survived the postFukushima wipeout of US new nuclear builds. That was V C Summer 23, another pair of AP1000s. Westinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt. Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"I dont totally agree. A big part of what made LEU work imo, is they had contract announcements that could easily be anticipated. I feel like the same setup exists here. The numbers on those contracts are not even out yet as far as I know. The report states they want a committed orderbook of 510 deployments of a single reactor design...these first orders would need to be placed by 2025. That would be the biggest nuclear announcement in the US in 4 decades. And BEPC would be PRing that. 2025 is not that far off either. And as you note the IV is much lower.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Right. They do not use large reactors in submarines. For some applications the primary consideration is size. For stuff that needs sub 30300 mw SMRs are useful. However, large reactors clock in 30 cheaper per unit of energy produced than SMRs. That is a huge difference. So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid i.e. majority of energy demand then large reactors are the way to go. The actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 57 data centers of 5 GW power each. That would take roughly 35 large power reactors. And they are just talking about what OpenAI wants.

The completion of Units 3 and 4 made Vogtle the largest clean energy generation site in the US as well as the largest energy generation site of any kind in the US. The cost of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not the correct anchor point for estimating additional AP1000s given costs that should not be incurred again. Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs. From page 4th. Notice they modeled the costs of future builds with the AP1000s and not any other design because they are keen on building AP1000s.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Thanks for posting this DD. Looking at BEPCs Q2 results nuclearWestinghouse revenues are described to fall under the Distributed Energy Storage line item, which was 61 million out of 830 million total 2024 revenue at the time of the report. I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price. Edit 2 So Ive learned in this article on the Westinghouse fraud case that they were paid 600 million for construction work in 201617.. so if BEPC gets 51 of something in that ballpark for multiple units, yeah could be huge for the SP Id imagine...

Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different.

No options, just buying shit stocks, not taking profits, etc. Still, I learned about options and you can make a ton of money just selling covered calls. I have about 60K and I make 500 to 1000 a week selling covered calls sometimes. Imagine the amount of money you could have made just selling covered calls with 1million!! You dont need to make it all in one day or a week. Slowly, you can make money, without taking all the risks. Sure, it is not as lucrative or sexy. But look at the alternative above!

Reddit,2024-10-04,"Reddit is a rough landing for this kind of vulnerability. I just wanted to say good luck to you, and I hope you do succeed with your new approach. Ive lost a ton since starting daytrading last year. In the simulator, I got to the point where I was routinely making 10k a day, and didnt know what else to practice before switching over to live trading . In the real world, Ive lost 10k in a day, a few times, but naively chalked it up to you gotta spend money to make money, and always assumed those 10k up days were just around the corner, to balance things out. But they never came, not even half that, and now my dream of making this my living is on life support. I hope the pressure of being backed into a corner makes me start protecting every dollar like my life depends on it. Odds are against us, and this community will generously remind us of that.

Duh.. it was so obvious. As long as I didnt take shots at the bars anymore, this kinda shit wouldnt happen. I didnt have a drinking problem, it was just the shots that were doing it. Duh. So from then on out, I would make sure all my whiskeys had some mixer in them. I loved a good whiskey ginger anyway. But I had it figured out this time, no shots, no hospital. Easy money. You see how insane that sounds? That was legitimately my logic. It wasnt an addiction, it was the shots. So I just mix a little soda in with them, and boom, problem solved. IVE TAMED IT. Spoiler alert. It wasnt just the shots. Im 8 years off the stuff and pretty quickly learned that total abstinence is way, way easier than convincing myself Ive tamed it. You are not me, I am not you.

My man, first of all whatever you think you lost was clearly never yours to begin with. The number one rule for anyone that isnt a sucker is that you dont gamble with money you cant afford to lose. The number two rule is you dont invest in speculatives that is gambling, not investing you invest in things that mean something, that produce things that people need, that provide actual meaningful value, in things that bring jobs, that benefit others thats investing. Do yourself a favor. Stop gambling. Go to work for a while and generate a nest egg that way. Along the way, maybe youll work for a company that will give you stock as a portion of your compensation. Convert that to a stable and diverse portfolio of low risk, low return investments for a while and stop trying to strike it rich in a flash. Most people spend their lives to earn a nest egg, some of them do get rich, most dont, and it isnt because theyre foolish or stupid. The markets are not where ordinary people get rich, they are where people who are already rich stow their wealth, and these days, if you notice, they dont really lose money anymore. This is a machine built by them for them and they influence policy to keep it working for them not you. They win, you lose, and you losing is how they win. Get wise and stop playing their game. If you want to play their game, then get them to invest in YOU, not the other way around. Get your life back and forget about getting rich by getting lucky or trying to beat the House.

Those are the firms that are getting INSANE returns, because the stock market is surprisingly mathematically. Those are the firms getting absolutely staggering ROIs. If youre buying stock because people are talking about it on reddit, then youre the mark. Youre the idiot they want buying the stock so the value pumps up and the real winners can sell.

From what you said, youve lost almost everything you hold dear. And youre still looking to prove to yourself youre not a fuck up, by doing the exact thing that got you into this mess in the first place. That is delusion at its finest. Your only hope is to end this madness, find whats meaningful to you in life, and begin a new journey, closing the chapter on the last. I know all too well the demons that come with gambling. Last year i won 1.2 mil and proceeded to lose it a week later all in one night all coked up. I dont know how it feels to lose youre wife and kids, but I sure know how it feels to feel like continuing down this road will find me redemption, when in reality, there is none. That was clear when I won the 1.2mil and it wasnt enough for me. IF you do reach your goal of 1million, youre not gonna stop there, I promise you. Whatever it may be, you will find a way to keep some skin in the game, and that will eventually lure you back to where you were not too long ago. Ive never spent this long typing shit out on the internet to try and help someone. This probably wont get through to you, but maybe it will. Bottom line, lose the fucking delusion. Get with reality.

He says its just the thrill of the game and the possibility of winning big. Even though he just had 2500 and then lost it all in fucking 20 minutes on a 20 dollar slot machine . Although Ive seen other times hell walk in with only 500 and by the end of the night only playing slot machines come out with 7000. So I guess its addicted to the thrill of winning something.

Reddit,2024-10-04,"My guess is Robinhood aggregates all money transfers into one big number and plots the graph based on that. OPs actual account values over time were likely very different and much smaller. So it might have started out like he said it did in 2019, responsible investing with small sums. Maybe 20k in the account, based on the total losses its a small dollar figure in variance, thats why in hindsight its like a straight line now compared to what might have followed He discovered options, lost 20k, transfered another 20k in to start fresh. Spike to 50k then the week after its 0. Next 20k in, rinse and repeat. Pretty much exactly what a gambler does at the casino. Occassionally a gambler wins, but the house has always the edge and takes all the money in the end. If you plot it based on all time losses its gonna look exactly like OPs graph.

Also Pete isnt a real person but its also a demonstration of how we all work through addiction differently and that EVERYONES addiction is valid it also makes it easier when a regular meeting has a new member with an addiction some would view as lesser. As someone 10 years clean from cocaine, soda as a kid was my gateway into uppers and I to this day have a Mountain Dew addiction but it helps me not use and Id rather this than coke. And yeah you dont NEED to hit rock bottom you just need to realize you cant live like this and be willing to and following through with making the changes to better your life. Most people Ive met people who wouldnt have grown had they not hit rock bottom which looks different than everybody. I think the 12 steps arent for everybody but theres alot of help going to a meeting the community and others stories have helped me alot I recommend you go to narcotics anonymous it and rehabs and other medical care will and should take your addiction seriously. Do not denigrate yourself just because someone elses struggle may be larger it doesnt demean your own or lower there importance. Do not use quotes around the word addiction referring to yourself with caffeine as it delegitimizes and demoralizes you instead of accepting it is an addiction which is the first step which is on display over here youre admitting you have a problem and that there being worse things you can be doing isnt a lesser addiction, the thing addicts have in common is being an addict not that they do bad or worse things or have a giant struggle. Your addiction is very real and you are valid I tried quitting drinking caffeine several times but honestly its what keeps me sober at the end of the day Ik its another addiction but on my body its been a lot easier.

Reddit,2024-09-15,"As someone that has long term invested in Costco and followed the company intimately as in not just a regarded Yolo invester I want to mention a couple things. First about your mention of a stock split. While there are a lot of speculations that this is on the horizon for Costco due to its current valuation getting close to 920share now and has been up 24 ytd there is no official announcement about this happening. Costco isnt a tech company, explosive growth is not what they are about. It is an incredible and well run company of course and is considered a compounding machine, so its basically a golden investment vehicle for a long term portfolio to build wealth. A stock split would be great to see and could drive more investment, but I dont think it would happen as quickly as you are thinking. Lots of these successful compounding machine style companies dont move quickly, generally a 1 2 rise or fall is all you see from them most days. Nothing at Costco or other great companies like Mastercard or Moodys or even Texas Roadhouse happen quickly. They make announcements for things months in advance, do their earnings calls and thats about it. They are boring to follow for someone looking to day trade simply because their stock isnt volatile. But in long term investing they are absolutely top tier. Boring is great! Tldr Costco doesnt and probably wont move as fast as you think, even if a stock split is announced Monday. Just two cents from a long term holder of Costco.",Neutral,0,0.9851519465446472,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-15,"Assuming this play does work, here is my plan of action come Friday 927, the day after COST ER. We cant just speculate on the move we have to speculate on how well execute the trade if it does work, to ensure the most success and tendies. COST ER is 926, after market. So, if earnings crush, forward guidance crushes, and they announce a split? And after market? This could absolutely rip, if those 3 aforementioned events happen. Could gap up pretty big. So, that said, my plan I currently have 15 options, up from 7. Will add more if COST dips more. For now, lets take what I will do with my 15 options on Friday morning. 1 I immediately sell some and take profits. I have 15 of the options. First thing in the morning, I will sell 25 of the contracts. Whatever amount will pay for the trade and net me a little profit on top of the fact. At 2140 for 15 1040c, I would sell however many it took to make 3000. Pay for the trade, and a little over 800 profit. So, Ill have made 3537 profit on the trade, and still have 1013 of the contracts left! Free trade, and 35 profit. Youve already won at this point. 2 Nothing. I wait until next week and do nothing. 3 Monday, the markets will have had a full weekend to process Thursday and Friday. Likely keeps going higher. The question is, when rug pull? We dont know, so we scale out of the trade and play it safe. 4 Monday by EOD, I scale out. I sell however many to be happy with the gains, what i would be sad about losing in profit pretty much. Lets say youre up 10k the following Monday. Ask yourself, how much of that 10k is life changing for you? What would you be sad to see go to zero on Tuesday? Is it 1000 out of 10k? Is it 5000? Only you can decide. Maybe it is 1000 in gains instead of 10k, or even 100k instead. That isnt the point. The point is, lock in the gains you would be sad to lose. I will be selling half of my position sometime on Monday. Will vary. Up to markets and price action when I do it. Say I have 10 out of 15 contracts on Monday, after Friday step 1. I will sell 3 of them at open, lock in the gains. Then, I will watch the chart the rest of the day. I will look to sell 23 more by EOD. 5 From Tuesday until Friday, I do nothing. I let the remaining 45 contracts ride. Zero or super hero. Maybe they go up another 1000 in gain, maybe they dont. I wont care, because Ive already made money. A big take away is this when trading options if your capital can afford it This is why grabbing more than one contract is optimal, it removes the emotions of wins and losses. Like my trade above, by scaling out in the manner described above, you remove all the emotions related to gains and losses. Friday, you set yourself up by not only getting a free trade. But also 35 profit. No negative thoughts now, youre already happy. Havent lost gains, or even money. Youre not only ahead on the trade, but now youre on a free trade with contracts left with 1 weeks time after a major catalyst. Monday, you lock in some more gains. Now, not only are you on a free trade, but now youre up 200 instead of 35. Youre even more thrilled than Friday! Free trade and up 200? Sweet! Now here is the best part. You dont give a FUCK what happens to those other contracts. Now? You can take them to zero expiration date, aka 104 and not give a flying fuck what happens. The rest of the contracts go to zero? WHO CARES? You made 200 on the trade. Congrats! But what if they continue to rip? Now, youre up possibly 1000 or more on the trade. Dont make that extra 800 by 104? Who cares, you made 200. And you didnt risk that 200 to try to get 1000. The idea is to trade in a manner that completely eliminates any emotions, positive or negative greed or fear. 1st order of business is paying for the trade and locking in a little gains. 2nd order of business is to lock in even more of the gains when it goes up or down for puts in your favor. Now, free trade, and big gains youre already happy with. 3rd order of business, let the others ride. Now you can handle all of the risk of them going to zero, because the trade was free, and you made profit. Regards",Neutral,0,0.9968274235725403,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-15,"They were very much lotto plays. I risked 3 of my capital on DLTR, and 10 on DG. I was extremely confident in the 1 store plays. I have the same gut feeling about this COST play that I did with the 1 store plays. But the 1 store plays had much more reasons for me to be confident. The speculation on the 1 was for a few reasons. 1 WMT is now better than 1 stores, and has online ordering and home delivery. I expected 1 stores to get crushed, not only because their business model isnt as good as it was years ago, their financial statements were declining every year since 2022, but WMT is absolutely crushing many businesses. Especially 1 stores. 2 1 stores were trading above very critical levels that had no been seen since 20162018, and tested them last year and bounced. The thesis was, if these major levels were cracked 100 for DG and 70 for DLTR then it would be a massive bloodbath to the downside. Especially since both were below the 55MA 55 day moving average institutions are in, below 55MA they are out. 3 The options were very cheap and the odds of them cracking those levels was pretty probable. Enough for me to grab 100 of the DG and DLTR puts. 3000 risk on both turned into 72k and 18k respectively. This COST play is much different because it is already trading near ATHs. COST can easily continue to go down, short term. Next levels for COST to test would be 872, 862, and 850. A bounce off of either levels, and a close above 900 before ER next week would be massively bullish IMO. Furthermore, they created a shit ton of strikes this morning. All the way up to 1260 for some reason. Interesting that they not only created new strikes already, but so many of them. Makes me wonder if MMs are preparing for a split. But ultimately, no one knows until ER next week. Im feeling good about it, enough to increase my position to 15 1040c instead of the 7 I started with. Todays dip is exactly what I wanted.",Positive,1,0.9327403903007507,Reply

And with that said, I think you might be unrealistically optimistic about the profitability aspect of increased viewership. The platform is growing quickly, no doubt because attention on the topic of free speech is growing. And certainly the entire Trump machine is helping that rightwing streamers, Don Junior, JD Vance, all favoring Rumble more than any other platform. However I dont see the platform working hard enough, or fast enough, or creatively enough to create ways to turn that into revenue. If it werent for the big donors like Trump, Musk, Vance, Thiel, etc, they probably wouldnt be able to operate at all. In my mind that puts them still very much in a startup phase... one in which you spend everything you can to gain users and spread your name.

Another notable fact is that most companies arent building out their own infrastructure, meaning that theyre just signing leases averaging a few years, similar to how most companies source all their current equipment. The consensus for this quarter is itll reflect the last round of big companies jumping aboard the AI train, but how many were left after that first big wave. and no...most companies dont upgrade all of their equipment as soon as the shiny new thing comes out All that said, the market is still highly volatile without any actionable news being released on rate cuts with contuining bad news piling up and everyone and their mom is talking about taking profits once the big NVDA pop comes.

Reddit,2024-08-28,I dont think you closely watched what happened to NVDIA and you have no clue what you are talking about. Last ER it rose because of the good result. From 95 to 118. The split push happened around the split 3 weeks later and it went to 142. The fact that it dropped is the reason why now it came back to 130 not because of the next ER. It dropped because of the yen carry trade and it came back where it should have been all along once the rates in Japan were corrected.,Positive,1,0.5360563397407532,Reply

The major price action happened because of the massive amount of calls LEAPS that a year ago when people bought them had no chance of being in the money, after Q1 earnings, had to be hedged by market makers, driving the price up and causing FOMO to a group of new investors that wanted to get in before the split.

Lets not forget, they were the most valuable company not too long ago. Tesla is no where near that. People dont trust Musk to take Tesla to the top. People trust Huang and in my opinion, rightfully so. That doesnt change the fact that expectations are extremely high for them, meaning they are expected to beat earnings by more than they did. Is that right? Sure its not, but when you have massive growth like they did and do, people start to lose sight of being realistic, even analysts. This causes unhealthy expectations and practically being set up to fail. At least in the short term.

Reddit,2024-08-26,"I dont know why people ignore trends. The economy is a mack truck, not a motorcycle. It doesnt turn on a dime. 5 unemployment is pretty much baked in at this point. Its going to happen at some point in the next 12 months...its not if but when. Even if the Fed cut the rates to 1 right now, wed still get there, because of the time lag of policy. The dire situation is that the Fed continues to pretend they can influence shortterm macroeconomics with decisions they make today. Like the single quarter or half point cut they deliver in September is going to do jackshit to arrest the clear trend of a rapidly declining work economy. Seriously, show my anywhere in this chart where the unemployment line starts turning up and then just smooths out or recovers without some kind of asymptotic spike. Once sentiment goes south, thats it. Fear is selfreinforcing. And were nearly there. Simply, we should have been at 45 Fed rate for the last few months, and should have been nearing a neutral rate of high 3s by the end of this year. Instead, were still severely restrictive. And at the rate the Fed wants to move, were not going to get to a neutral rate until mid2025, if not later. The dire situation will be recognized soon enough. Not everyone can see the iceberg yet. And as usual, when they do, its going to be far too late. Though on the positive side of things, I dont think itll be a particularly nasty or extended recession due to a number of positive factors, including most people being locked into low rate mortgages. Itll be shortterm economic malaise, the market will likely overfreak out, unemployment may peak around 67, and then well be back to a smooth sailing bull market.

Reddit,2024-08-19,"Well, RKLB is currently more of a satellite company than rocket company. Their main source of revenue as of now is their space systems segment. The investment thesis on RKLB is in their vision of becoming an endtoend space company with capabilities of producing and putting their own space infrastructure into space. The stock will probably skyrocket in late 2025 when their new rocket Neutron that will launch these constellations, is flying successfully. Approximately a year forward from there, when RKLB announces its constellation the stock will probably skyrocket again. As the TAM of the space industry is growing and the race for militaries and big tech companies to own a share of the constellations in space, to not fall behind, starts to accelerate, Ill be glad that i kept my shares for the long term.

Reddit,2024-08-09,"Short term earnings have been priced in. long term, growth will rely on the continued relevancy of AI. Either it needs to become extremely profitable or become essential to remaining competitive. Theres a huge level of fear that the capex will be for naught and it will be a fad. Not such a big deal for other tech that have diversified revenue streams but for NVIDIA it would be a death stroke until such point as AI developed to the point that it is commercially viable. Who knows how long that would be or if it would even be based on the same hardware. Also, tech represents the early adoption part of the bell curve which means it is the first to suffer pull backs in tough macro economic settings when people are more conservative, hence why essentials like utilities preform well and are popular in those times. A mix of the two is what is causing the latest pull back and due to NVDAs dominance, other semi conductor companies have seen mixed earnings.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Now is an ideal time, because the stock is already dumped so much, a lot of downside risk has already been accounted for. Plus the IV is just insane right now. Check this out Right now, you can sell a CSP on an 80 strike expiring on January 17. This is going to pay you a 9 premium, over 163 days, which is going to annualize to 20 a year. Nvidia would have to drop another 20 to ever hit that strike, and lets say it does, at that point youre basically buying it for a 50 discount from its alltime high. Even better, instead of a CSP, sell a deep ITM CC at the same strike. That way the contract value depreciates with the stock price, since its a bullish play. So if the stock actually approaches 80 and you want to get out of dodge, theres a very high likelihood you can rebuy your contract for a fraction of what you sold it for, heavily managing your risk.",Neutral,0,0.9626192450523376,Reply

Further, the news about a so called design flaw is really go questionable validity or usefulness..

Yahoo,2024-08-09,"I don&#39;t quite understand this drop today on what was undeniably a super quarterly performance by ODD. 
So HELE a few weeks back had recession-like earnings and stock got crushed. They saw consumer weakness most concentrated in their beauty division, which is mostly hair care. I saw this and wondered if a slow down might have occurred at ODD. 
After the  close today ELF is down 10% after reporting their performance. I have not reviewed their results as of yet. 
I&#39;m convinced the huge short position in ODD is the problem. Stock is heavy w/ institutional and insider ownership. It lacks liquidity and the shorts know this. They have mngmt pinned knowing they can&#39;t sell and institutions see no reason to add. 
Co CFO is from Goldman,  who I believe banked the IPO. I&#39;ve been investing long enough to know that Goldman will enable shorts. It is going to take several more quarters of good earnings to shed  these shorts. They are shorting 30% + of the float. Buy back news -upped guidance didn&#39;t help. I sold 3/4 my position w/great reluctance but also with measured prudence. I hope this Mngmt team knows how to deal with these shorts. They will eventually; more likely soon attack.",Negative,-1,0.9900915622711182,Main
