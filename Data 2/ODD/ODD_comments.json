If people keep buying this stock the fundamentals of the business do not matter AT ALL. Like Donald, this stock is officially a MEME stock. What will happen though, is a massive offering to offset the bad fundamentals. They would be stupid if they do not do a public offering now. What will also happen is Trump will sell a large chunk. The danger, Saudi Arabia buying shares, or Russia. I will make another prediction, this stock will be at 47 by the end of the month, because nothing screams economic success more that a symbolic stock price.

And also, how to invest the 25 conservative part in something that doesnt suck as much as bond funds. So, I use financial advisors and they do invest in individual stocks, along with broadbased long term index funds, to take advantage of tax harvesting and other tax strategies. I hate the advisory fees, but its needed once you have actual capital. Before that, as an individual, consistently socking small amounts into VOO, or VTSAX, and other index funds was not as exciting as stocks, but over time, was a helluva lot more profitable. Less stressful too. Generally, if you are betting on individual companies yourself, you may as well just go to Vegas.

Of course the 40 of shares not held by Trump are in play and those investors will be affected by the outcome. Mods nixed it anyways. OP, I hope your post survives longer.

A, as a lady with a hardtomatch face and hideously sensitive skin, that has taken hundreds of dollars and years of trial and error with actual samples. B, as a former academic in a particular field, Im aware that even in person, quantifying the color of someones skin to an accuracy that could be used for research takes some specialized equipment, and even then youre leaving a considerable amount of variability out of your data.

There are a number of complaints about the subscription service and pricing which raises questions about the repeat customers cited in the comment above. It seems like their advantage is primarily is in heavy, welltargeted marketing and advertisting, which honestly, ok, it might make them money, and I could be totally wrong.

When they say they use AI to get your foundation shade, I was hoping that they would use my camera to calculate pigmentation or something. But nope. It was just an online quiz that relies on you, the consumer thats not good at this stuff, to keep guessing which picture looks most like your skin. This has so many areas for problems unless everyone has the perfect screen settings for their desktopmobile devices. And when I finished the quiz, it wouldnt show me the results unless I put in my email address. This has always been a company pet peeve of mine.

Oddity is another atypical investment for us but one which we believe has substantial opportunity for growth. It is the first ever IPO we have taken part in, and we did not do so lightly. We got to know the management several months before the IPO as we were approached directly by the company after they had been made aware that the business exhibited much of what we look for in a high quality, growing company. We were extremely impressed by the track record as well as the potential opportunity for the company. Oddity is a beauty and wellness company which creates its own brands and products to sell direct to consumers online. So far, the company has launched two brands, Il Makiage and SpoiledChild, both of which have been the fastest growing online brands in history, and now sell more online than large established beauty brands such as MAC. Traditionally there has been a large knowledge gap between consumers and beauty experts, requiring consumers to interact with a trained salesperson to match the myriad of beauty products to their needs and show them how to apply them at home. The large established cosmetics companies havent so far made strong attempts to sell products to new customers online refill purchases are obviously easier but Oddity has been able to build AI technology using data from their users 1bn datapoints from 40m users to learn how to match the right products to consumers with inputs including online questionnaires and, increasingly, selfie photos. Their 90 skin match accuracy compared to 80 instore equivalent has generated over 4m customers, with more than half of revenue now coming from repeat customers. This is not only a strong indication of the value of their service but is also much more profitable. We expect to see very high annual revenue growth for the next few years as the companys technology is several years ahead of established competitors and addresses such an enormous potential market."

The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years. Why do you think it ran up? It still hasnt lost the daily uptrend and it has retained tremendous growth after doubling in value."

Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way."

Whereas where I live in Colorado now, youd never see any type of high end brand and typically just see your garbage landlord special laminate and low end appliances and bathroom fixings no Toto, cheap kohlers, cheap American standard, etc But overall the housing improvement market has vastly slowed due to high interest rates, so Im surprised it took this long for HD to see the impact"

Ive never seen a subreddit that discusses it. Probably because they dont occur very often at least for US stocks. I have seen them for Canadian stocks and Ive played around with 2 or 3. But the way that the taxes work because I am US based doesnt make it particularly efficient. Also there is timing so any arbitrage needs to take into account the current riskfree rate. So whenever Ive tried it at least for me the odd lot arbitrage was basically just capturing the riskfree rate but with a lot of extra steps. Thats the other reason why I stopped bothering with them."

                    "text": "Just to add to greytocs response and a bit more of an explanation of what they are. So generally when a company wants to buy back some of its shares it needs to incentivise shareholders to actually sell them, this would be done by offering to buy back the shares at a premium to where they are currently trading. Lets just pick the numbers shares are trading at 10 and the company offer to buy back shares for 11, a 10 premium. This is a great deal, you want to tender these. So you would want to buy shares to tender them at 11. What normally happens though is that the company will offer to buy back say 10 of their shares outstanding and that is all. What happens if 100 of shareholders try to take the offer to tender their shares? Well they get what is called prorated, where the company looks, sees that 100 of people wanted to tender and says, well we only have 10 to buy so we will buy 110 of everyones tenders. So if you wanted to tender 1,000 shares, they actually only buy 100 back off you. So what happens in practice is that they announce the tender and rather than stock shooting up to 11 a share it actually only jumps to about 10.10 as that is what you can actually get as an average fill on selling it back. these numbers are a large simplification for illustrative purposes to understand the basics, there are a few more things to consider. The oddlot tender provision basically just says anyone who tenders under 100 shares, we will give you priority and buy ALL of you shares first. So you are pretty much guaranteed to receive that 11 amount. Which is nice, as stock is still trading lower because arbitrage pricing wont force it higher as individuals can only buy up to 99 shares. So thats the basics. Its pretty nice when they come around. They are pretty limited in scale as obviously can only work for up to 99 shares in the company so you kindve need a high priced stock and a nice premium offered to make it a significant windfall. They can be nice to collect some free pocket money though if you get in the habit of just doing them with minimal operational overhead. Interest rates and time to return your money is obviously a consideration as greytoc said. Taxes obviously diminish your gains but dont they always and if its a pure arb itd be rude not to. Of course tenders can be withdrawn, updated, collapse etc. so thats a risk but one that tends to be okay to bear. A further complication is that in some of the best ones they are not actually offering to buy back shares with cash but with shares in another company. You will then bear some risk in that equity. Hope this helps."

I didnt think about some of the risks like the tender offer being pulled or assuming risk in a new company being paid with stock. At 99 shares though it is limited downside to the portfolio. Do you typically try to buy close to the end of the offer period? I assume price ticks up as the end approaches.

In those years you only make 30. 30 sounds fine, but one year of 1030 underperformance means youll need many years of 0.2 to get back to even. And in this case, 0.2 just covers a portion of fees and expenses, youd need 4060bps of premium to actually have positive carry owning SPY vs SPY constituents. The market is much more volatile than people intuit. You dont think youre walking away from much 30. But annual SPY returns are a nonnormal distribution. SPY is very tail heavy. Those super OTM call bids are at 5c or 1 because someone very smart and very wellinformed believes they are worth more than their bid."

In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is. The value is added by gas centrifuging UF6. Only governments can do that."

Westinghouse stake, which is important imo if we want to play value investor and talk about EVEBITDA comparables etc. Nuclear trade all about vibesreflexivity and while this trade can certainly work, a confusing Brookfield family stonk seems like more of a heavy lift bc of complexity for less upside vs clean setup like LEU or just riding current winners after they cool off. That said, BEPC low IV option chain reduced potential downside volatility relative to other nuclear names up 100 on the month is attractive for risk management, for sure, but expectations should prob be moderated...Just gut reaction tho so heres to hoping trade works out"

The government hasnt exactly been spearheading the development of AI, I wouldnt be one bit surprised if the private sector figures out how to get the capacity needed quicker. Also AGI is probably more than two decades away, and it requires ingenuity and creativity just as much as it requires raw power, so megawatt count isnt deciding the winner.

That was V C Summer 23, another pair of AP1000s. Westinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt. Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK. Among nonauthoritarian countries in the last couple of decades, only South Korea has managed to build large nuclear reactors on a reasonable budget and schedule.

So a 35 44 move here would get about the same 10x return as the 55 90 move in LEU. That said, I am not trying to make some huge parallel with LEU here. Getting any kind of DD on new companies is close to impossible though."

However, large reactors clock in 30 cheaper per unit of energy produced than SMRs. That is a huge difference. So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid i.e. majority of energy demand then large reactors are the way to go. The actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 57 data centers of 5 GW power each. That would take roughly 35 large power reactors. And they are just talking about what OpenAI wants. Microsoft just struck a deal to reopen a nuclear plant in NY as well."

The completion of Units 3 and 4 made Vogtle the largest clean energy generation site in the US as well as the largest energy generation site of any kind in the US. The cost of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not the correct anchor point for estimating additional AP1000s given costs that should not be incurred again. Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs. From page 4th. Notice they modeled the costs of future builds with the AP1000s and not any other design because they are keen on building AP1000s.

Looking at BEPCs Q2 results nuclearWestinghouse revenues are described to fall under the Distributed Energy Storage line item, which was 61 million out of 830 million total 2024 revenue at the time of the report. I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price. Edit 2 So Ive learned in this article on the Westinghouse fraud case that they were paid 600 million for construction work in 201617.. so if BEPC gets 51 of something in that ballpark for multiple units, yeah could be huge for the SP Id imagine... Im very interested. Someone come and poke holes in this please."

But the nuclear industry always claims that theyll learn their lessons and the next build will be smoother and on time and budget. And it never is. Basically every plant built in the 70s and 80s in the US had huge overruns, and many were cancelled after TMI. Even Watts Bar took much longer to complete than expected. Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different. This is unfortunately why the nuclear industry, which should be a perfect complement to solar and wind, and perfect for AI, is instead a sunset industry."

I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company.

You see how insane that sounds? That was legitimately my logic. It wasnt an addiction, it was the shots. So I just mix a little soda in with them, and boom, problem solved. IVE TAMED IT. Spoiler alert. It wasnt just the shots. Im 8 years off the stuff and pretty quickly learned that total abstinence is way, way easier than convincing myself Ive tamed it. You are not me, I am not you.

Because wether you realize it or not it comes through in your words in this post. You think you are the hottest shit that ever traded the market. Second, make a plan. Maybe you have one but you probably dont. I mean a specific plan for every trade and something that actually works. You made 14K this week? Whoop de fucking do because from where I sit you couldve just as easily lost it if you arent doing something fundamentally different than the way you lost that million. If this sounds harsh, it is. But would you rather hear the truth or would you rather surround yourself with cheer leaders? One could possibly help you, the other definitely wont. Im not saying you cant do this. Im saying what youre doing clearly isnt working and youre entire post is laughable bullshit. Good luck, i mean it sincerely."

The same thing youre trying to do now literally destroyed your life, and youre addict brain is trying to tell you why youre good at investing. You lost a million dollars, thats okay for extremely wealthy traders who can afford to lose it but you didnt even have the money to lose, you gambled your life away and hurt people in the process. Thats the definition of a problem. If you do make it back, which you very well may, not because you mastered the market, but due to the luck of gambling, you will lose it again because youre an addict. Im just being real with you. If you get to 1 mill you wont have learnt your lesson and just stop and do regular work or live off the interest. Youll gamble it again and see potential . Best of luck."

The black Scholes modelbinormal theorem? Options are meant to be used as hedges against black swan events. U can even use options as an income source if you know what u are doing. Options used for speculation should not be more than 2 of your portfolio. Meeting finance professionals wont do shit. I literally went to university to pursue a degree in finance and economics to become a better trader. This isnt it... Learn about finance, corporate finance, accounting, statistics, macroeconomics, microeconomics and more if you are serious. Technical analysis mixed with these disciplines will make you a great trader. Trading is a marathon it aint a sprint."

I took the remaining 150K and paid the IRS for short term capital gains. The rest I used to buy a tesla with cash for rideshare for part time money. ive rebuilt it my port by working ridewwhare with the tesla. Im at around 190K and all in again with amd. riding amd to 300, i dont expect to hit 560K again for a long time but i think i can get it back to 300K and by adding my montly savings slowly, it will get there in a few years. op, your treasure is your family, wife kids. at your death bed youre not going.to be wishing you could trade more but that you could have spent more time with them. treasure them!"

The only thing you have is a track record of being a bad gambler losing everything, including your family. To think you are going to 40x your money and get back to a million is simply part of your addiction. You deep down know this. You would probably be skeptical of even the best investors in the world saying they could 40x their money. Would you actually believe even the best could do it? No, of course not. It takes incredibly skill and luck to ever 40x your money on the markets. So why do you, one of the worst, think you can do it."

If your words are true, OP, I think youve got an amazing opportunity in front of you with X or a YouTube channel documenting the process of solving the aforementioned problem. What is your discipline like? What does the actual daily routine of a successful trader look like? Not the bullshit you see online, but the real life mundane aspects of managing your psyche. How does the real sauce get made? If it is actually possible to come back from a million dollar loss How? Ill certainly subscribe and be rooting for you."

My man, first of all whatever you think you lost was clearly never yours to begin with. The number one rule for anyone that isnt a sucker is that you dont gamble with money you cant afford to lose. The number two rule is you dont invest in speculatives that is gambling, not investing you invest in things that mean something, that produce things that people need, that provide actual meaningful value, in things that bring jobs, that benefit others thats investing. Do yourself a favor. Stop gambling. Go to work for a while and generate a nest egg that way. Along the way, maybe youll work for a company that will give you stock as a portion of your compensation. Convert that to a stable and diverse portfolio of low risk, low return investments for a while and stop trying to strike it rich in a flash. Most people spend their lives to earn a nest egg, some of them do get rich, most dont, and it isnt because theyre foolish or stupid. The markets are not where ordinary people get rich, they are where people who are already rich stow their wealth, and these days, if you notice, they dont really lose money anymore. This is a machine built by them for them and they influence policy to keep it working for them not you. They win, you lose, and you losing is how they win. Get wise and stop playing their game. If you want to play their game, then get them to invest in YOU, not the other way around. Get your life back and forget about getting rich by getting lucky or trying to beat the House. Do this and youll be rich enough with a stable life and people around you to enjoy it with. Build something meaningful that matters to others a pile of personal cash aint it."

If youre going to get back into investing, look for firms that were started by lifelong mathematicians. Legit, people who worked in academia their whole life doing math. Those are the firms that are getting INSANE returns, because the stock market is surprisingly mathematically. Those are the firms getting absolutely staggering ROIs. If youre buying stock because people are talking about it on reddit, then youre the mark. Youre the idiot they want buying the stock so the value pumps up and the real winners can sell. Only a handful of people win on those stocks and everyone else loses everything. Dont forget that as long as you own the stocks, you dont have any money Please be careful out there."

I know people who paper trades and have an edge and then lose it all live because when u have greed and fear or loss or prejudice youll lose. Most people fail because they cannot adapt to changing market direction and always think their original position is good. Just look at th loss porn at WSB. And most people fail because of fear. Fear of loss so they never sell. Fear losing th gain so they cut early. And not following the plan. Size down and go for much longer time frame. Trade micros only or single contract option expiring in weeks or months. I mean i will love to take your money all day but you are just gambling at this point"

Every single mistake HURTS with a small account. You can make the same mistake using the same money but if you have 1 million in your account then it feels like not a big loss. Ive been trading since April when I got fired. I can make 1030 returns on my bankroll everyday. 26 trades a day, with stocks. Bare minimum you have an equity instead of a useless contract. You can still take huge hits with equities of course. Master self control and be happy with small and safe wins. My worst days learning were when I made a sick 75 gain in like 30 seconds, then Id spend the rest of the day gambling with progressively less standards for trades. In June I decided to stop being greedy. I turned 63 into 2100 in 3 weeks. One trade a day. My motivation was having to go another couple days without food or use my fucking head lol. Good luck and please start small if you decide to get in there again. The market doesnt owe you that money just forget about it other than the life lesson."

From what you said, youve lost almost everything you hold dear.

Your only hope is to end this madness, find whats meaningful to you in life, and begin a new journey, closing the chapter on the last. I know all too well the demons that come with gambling. Last year i won 1.2 mil and proceeded to lose it a week later all in one night all coked up. I dont know how it feels to lose youre wife and kids, but I sure know how it feels to feel like continuing down this road will find me redemption, when in reality, there is none. That was clear when I won the 1.2mil and it wasnt enough for me. IF you do reach your goal of 1million, youre not gonna stop there, I promise you. Whatever it may be, you will find a way to keep some skin in the game, and that will eventually lure you back to where you were not too long ago. Ive never spent this long typing shit out on the internet to try and help someone. This probably wont get through to you, but maybe it will. Bottom line, lose the fucking delusion. Get with reality. Move on. End of story. Hope this helps.

He says its just the thrill of the game and the possibility of winning big. Even though he just had 2500 and then lost it all in fucking 20 minutes on a 20 dollar slot machine . Although Ive seen other times hell walk in with only 500 and by the end of the night only playing slot machines come out with 7000. So I guess its addicted to the thrill of winning something.

Maybe 20k in the account, based on the total losses its a small dollar figure in variance, thats why in hindsight its like a straight line now compared to what might have followed He discovered options, lost 20k, transfered another 20k in to start fresh. Spike to 50k then the week after its 0. Next 20k in, rinse and repeat. Pretty much exactly what a gambler does at the casino. Occassionally a gambler wins, but the house has always the edge and takes all the money in the end. If you plot it based on all time losses its gonna look exactly like OPs graph.

Also Pete isnt a real person but its also a demonstration of how we all work through addiction differently and that EVERYONES addiction is valid it also makes it easier when a regular meeting has a new member with an addiction some would view as lesser. As someone 10 years clean from cocaine, soda as a kid was my gateway into uppers and I to this day have a Mountain Dew addiction but it helps me not use and Id rather this than coke. And yeah you dont NEED to hit rock bottom you just need to realize you cant live like this and be willing to and following through with making the changes to better your life. Most people Ive met people who wouldnt have grown had they not hit rock bottom which looks different than everybody. I think the 12 steps arent for everybody but theres alot of help going to a meeting the community and others stories have helped me alot I recommend you go to narcotics anonymous it and rehabs and other medical care will and should take your addiction seriously. Do not denigrate yourself just because someone elses struggle may be larger it doesnt demean your own or lower there importance. Do not use quotes around the word addiction referring to yourself with caffeine as it delegitimizes and demoralizes you instead of accepting it is an addiction which is the first step which is on display over here youre admitting you have a problem and that there being worse things you can be doing isnt a lesser addiction, the thing addicts have in common is being an addict not that they do bad or worse things or have a giant struggle. Your addiction is very real and you are valid I tried quitting drinking caffeine several times but honestly its what keeps me sober at the end of the day Ik its another addiction but on my body its been a lot easier. With caffeine addiction I recommend titrating down slowly with daily intake"

The probability of 10baggers increase on eco data days and mega cap earnings days. Depends on your model and what you trade. I trade SPX exclusively, and in my case Fed announcements, mega cap earnings, etc. raise premiums way too high for it to generate a buy signal, I usually get them when things are relatively calm.

First about your mention of a stock split. While there are a lot of speculations that this is on the horizon for Costco due to its current valuation getting close to 920share now and has been up 24 ytd there is no official announcement about this happening. Costco isnt a tech company, explosive growth is not what they are about. It is an incredible and well run company of course and is considered a compounding machine, so its basically a golden investment vehicle for a long term portfolio to build wealth. A stock split would be great to see and could drive more investment, but I dont think it would happen as quickly as you are thinking. Lots of these successful compounding machine style companies dont move quickly, generally a 1 2 rise or fall is all you see from them most days. Nothing at Costco or other great companies like Mastercard or Moodys or even Texas Roadhouse happen quickly. They make announcements for things months in advance, do their earnings calls and thats about it. They are boring to follow for someone looking to day trade simply because their stock isnt volatile. But in long term investing they are absolutely top tier. Boring is great! Tldr Costco doesnt and probably wont move as fast as you think, even if a stock split is announced Monday. Just two cents from a long term holder of Costco."

Taking advantage of smaller dipshit institutions that only manage billions instead of trillions. That wrote naked options they cant pay out. How do we do that? Well, some people that are even more autistic and regarded than we at WSB wrote naked options for the 1040 and 1060 strikes. With no hedge. How do we fuck them in the ass as hard as possible and make them take our place at Wendys? First off, we own 20 of the shares, so already have a big say in how the company is run. But we also manage 25 Trillion fucking dollars. We pay the CEO of COST to announce a split, drive the price of the stock to over 1100, and put these smaller funds out of position, with no hedge. And ultimately, only 1.67 a piece for these options. I can lose 167, and will happily do so if the gain is 1050x that. Just my thoughts."

Perhaps instead of focusing on the possibility of a split, we should explore other factors driving Costcos stock price. Id love to see more discussion around this!"

We cant just speculate on the move we have to speculate on how well execute the trade if it does work, to ensure the most success and tendies. COST ER is 926, after market. So, if earnings crush, forward guidance crushes, and they announce a split? And after market? This could absolutely rip, if those 3 aforementioned events happen. Could gap up pretty big. So, that said, my plan I currently have 15 options, up from 7. Will add more if COST dips more. For now, lets take what I will do with my 15 options on Friday morning. 1 I immediately sell some and take profits. I have 15 of the options. First thing in the morning, I will sell 25 of the contracts. Whatever amount will pay for the trade and net me a little profit on top of the fact. At 2140 for 15 1040c, I would sell however many it took to make 3000. Pay for the trade, and a little over 800 profit. So, Ill have made 3537 profit on the trade, and still have 1013 of the contracts left! Free trade, and 35 profit. Youve already won at this point. 2 Nothing. I wait until next week and do nothing. 3 Monday, the markets will have had a full weekend to process Thursday and Friday. Likely keeps going higher. The question is, when rug pull? We dont know, so we scale out of the trade and play it safe. 4 Monday by EOD, I scale out. I sell however many to be happy with the gains, what i would be sad about losing in profit pretty much. Lets say youre up 10k the following Monday. Ask yourself, how much of that 10k is life changing for you? What would you be sad to see go to zero on Tuesday? Is it 1000 out of 10k? Is it 5000? Only you can decide. Maybe it is 1000 in gains instead of 10k, or even 100k instead. That isnt the point. The point is, lock in the gains you would be sad to lose. I will be selling half of my position sometime on Monday. Will vary. Up to markets and price action when I do it. Say I have 10 out of 15 contracts on Monday, after Friday step 1. I will sell 3 of them at open, lock in the gains. Then, I will watch the chart the rest of the day. I will look to sell 23 more by EOD. 5 From Tuesday until Friday, I do nothing. I let the remaining 45 contracts ride. Zero or super hero. Maybe they go up another 1000 in gain, maybe they dont. I wont care, because Ive already made money. A big take away is this when trading options if your capital can afford it This is why grabbing more than one contract is optimal, it removes the emotions of wins and losses. Like my trade above, by scaling out in the manner described above, you remove all the emotions related to gains and losses. Friday, you set yourself up by not only getting a free trade. But also 35 profit. No negative thoughts now, youre already happy. Havent lost gains, or even money. Youre not only ahead on the trade, but now youre on a free trade with contracts left with 1 weeks time after a major catalyst. Monday, you lock in some more gains. Now, not only are you on a free trade, but now youre up 200 instead of 35. Youre even more thrilled than Friday! Free trade and up 200? Sweet! Now here is the best part. You dont give a FUCK what happens to those other contracts. Now? You can take them to zero expiration date, aka 104 and not give a flying fuck what happens. The rest of the contracts go to zero? WHO CARES? You made 200 on the trade. Congrats! But what if they continue to rip? Now, youre up possibly 1000 or more on the trade. Dont make that extra 800 by 104? Who cares, you made 200. And you didnt risk that 200 to try to get 1000. The idea is to trade in a manner that completely eliminates any emotions, positive or negative greed or fear. 1st order of business is paying for the trade and locking in a little gains. 2nd order of business is to lock in even more of the gains when it goes up or down for puts in your favor. Now, free trade, and big gains youre already happy with. 3rd order of business, let the others ride. Now you can handle all of the risk of them going to zero, because the trade was free, and you made profit. Regards"

I have the same gut feeling about this COST play that I did with the 1 store plays. But the 1 store plays had much more reasons for me to be confident. The speculation on the 1 was for a few reasons. 1 WMT is now better than 1 stores, and has online ordering and home delivery. I expected 1 stores to get crushed, not only because their business model isnt as good as it was years ago, their financial statements were declining every year since 2022, but WMT is absolutely crushing many businesses. Especially 1 stores. 2 1 stores were trading above very critical levels that had no been seen since 20162018, and tested them last year and bounced. The thesis was, if these major levels were cracked 100 for DG and 70 for DLTR then it would be a massive bloodbath to the downside. Especially since both were below the 55MA 55 day moving average institutions are in, below 55MA they are out. 3 The options were very cheap and the odds of them cracking those levels was pretty probable. Enough for me to grab 100 of the DG and DLTR puts. 3000 risk on both turned into 72k and 18k respectively. This COST play is much different because it is already trading near ATHs. COST can easily continue to go down, short term. Next levels for COST to test would be 872, 862, and 850. A bounce off of either levels, and a close above 900 before ER next week would be massively bullish IMO. Furthermore, they created a shit ton of strikes this morning. All the way up to 1260 for some reason. Interesting that they not only created new strikes already, but so many of them. Makes me wonder if MMs are preparing for a split. But ultimately, no one knows until ER next week. Im feeling good about it, enough to increase my position to 15 1040c instead of the 7 I started with. Todays dip is exactly what I wanted."

And with that said, I think you might be unrealistically optimistic about the profitability aspect of increased viewership. The platform is growing quickly, no doubt because attention on the topic of free speech is growing. And certainly the entire Trump machine is helping that rightwing streamers, Don Junior, JD Vance, all favoring Rumble more than any other platform. However I dont see the platform working hard enough, or fast enough, or creatively enough to create ways to turn that into revenue. If it werent for the big donors like Trump, Musk, Vance, Thiel, etc, they probably wouldnt be able to operate at all. In my mind that puts them still very much in a startup phase... one in which you spend everything you can to gain users and spread your name. Its all fine and natural in the world of tech startups, and Im sure that they will eventually be a massively successful platform. _Eventually._ But I wouldnt be betting on them until they turn their focus to revenue.

The consensus for this quarter is itll reflect the last round of big companies jumping aboard the AI train, but how many were left after that first big wave. and no...most companies dont upgrade all of their equipment as soon as the shiny new thing comes out All that said, the market is still highly volatile without any actionable news being released on rate cuts with contuining bad news piling up and everyone and their mom is talking about taking profits once the big NVDA pop comes. Did I forget to mention were in an election cycle? Im sitting out earnings and assessing the play day of. As of right now, Im thinking the safer play is to short the high."

Analyst predictions are kind of bad historically in my experience I think theyre important to set expectations but they can be weaponized, bought and sold, and you never know what sort of politicalpower games are being played on the street. If I tried to trade just according to analyst price targets, it would be impossible to pick out who to listen to or why.

People trust Huang and in my opinion, rightfully so. That doesnt change the fact that expectations are extremely high for them, meaning they are expected to beat earnings by more than they did. Is that right? Sure its not, but when you have massive growth like they did and do, people start to lose sight of being realistic, even analysts. This causes unhealthy expectations and practically being set up to fail. At least in the short term. On the plus side, this may help the next earnings cycle as people may not expect them to beat earnings by over 10 anymore."

Its going to happen at some point in the next 12 months...its not if but when. Even if the Fed cut the rates to 1 right now, wed still get there, because of the time lag of policy. The dire situation is that the Fed continues to pretend they can influence shortterm macroeconomics with decisions they make today. Like the single quarter or half point cut they deliver in September is going to do jackshit to arrest the clear trend of a rapidly declining work economy. Seriously, show my anywhere in this chart where the unemployment line starts turning up and then just smooths out or recovers without some kind of asymptotic spike. Once sentiment goes south, thats it. Fear is selfreinforcing. And were nearly there. Simply, we should have been at 45 Fed rate for the last few months, and should have been nearing a neutral rate of high 3s by the end of this year. Instead, were still severely restrictive. And at the rate the Fed wants to move, were not going to get to a neutral rate until mid2025, if not later. The dire situation will be recognized soon enough. Not everyone can see the iceberg yet. And as usual, when they do, its going to be far too late. Though on the positive side of things, I dont think itll be a particularly nasty or extended recession due to a number of positive factors, including most people being locked into low rate mortgages. Itll be shortterm economic malaise, the market will likely overfreak out, unemployment may peak around 67, and then well be back to a smooth sailing bull market. There should be some buying opportunities near the bottom though."

Again, Im not one of these option gangs yolo all the time and gain as big as the sky, a few thousand percentday, its not me. When I first started my trades, I went over all the derivatives such as options and futures, I used to be up a few hundred percent in 2 days of the weekend. But I couldnt control my greed, I blew my account, after that I took revenge trades, I blew my account 2 more times. I made a lot of mistakes during my trading days. Now, before I place a trade, I always look at the downsides first. My account started increasing bit by bit, my recommendation for you is do not gambling, dont trust anyone about their technique, especially Youtubers and coaches bla bla. You have to figure out your risk appetite, find your own way to make money that aligns with your own time, dont try to be an outlier such as WB or BNF. Getting rich gradually will stabilize as the mountain."

The investment thesis on RKLB is in their vision of becoming an endtoend space company with capabilities of producing and putting their own space infrastructure into space. The stock will probably skyrocket in late 2025 when their new rocket Neutron that will launch these constellations, is flying successfully. Approximately a year forward from there, when RKLB announces its constellation the stock will probably skyrocket again. As the TAM of the space industry is growing and the race for militaries and big tech companies to own a share of the constellations in space, to not fall behind, starts to accelerate, Ill be glad that i kept my shares for the long term. Personally my portfolio is widely concentrated in RKLB and Im following the company closely and have been doing so for the past two years. My rough estimation of when Ill start trimming the position is no earlier than 2030."

Not such a big deal for other tech that have diversified revenue streams but for NVIDIA it would be a death stroke until such point as AI developed to the point that it is commercially viable. Who knows how long that would be or if it would even be based on the same hardware. Also, tech represents the early adoption part of the bell curve which means it is the first to suffer pull backs in tough macro economic settings when people are more conservative, hence why essentials like utilities preform well and are popular in those times. A mix of the two is what is causing the latest pull back and due to NVDAs dominance, other semi conductor companies have seen mixed earnings.

However, the reality seems to have started sinking in real benefits of AI are in the far away future. So I think most companies have slowed down their pursuit of the AI revolution and are waiting for it to get developed enough to become profitable. This is why I expect NVDA to go down after ER. The expectations of the market and big money are very high but the reality is showing a different story. However, prior NVDA history shows that their ER get a lot of people a major erection so anything is possible with them. This is why Ill be sitting this ER out.

If NVDA sees a sustained pullback, it will likely be in late next year under two conditions 1. Rates do not drop at expected pace. Cheaper money means more AI infrastructure investment. 2. Investors get fedup with the lack of return and high capex of AI infrastructure"

Nvidia would have to drop another 20 to ever hit that strike, and lets say it does, at that point youre basically buying it for a 50 discount from its alltime high. Even better, instead of a CSP, sell a deep ITM CC at the same strike. That way the contract value depreciates with the stock price, since its a bullish play. So if the stock actually approaches 80 and you want to get out of dodge, theres a very high likelihood you can rebuy your contract for a fraction of what you sold it for, heavily managing your risk."

Further, the news about a so called design flaw is really go questionable validity or usefulness.. If a stock goes below the strike price the option seller will typically find they automatically bought the underlying stock at the lower price. One of course picks up a premium for selling this insurance policy. Its a great way to generate extra cashflow similarly to covered calls. One typically sells puts when they would mind owning the stock anyway but also wants guaranteed cashflow."

However, I take a slightly different view to you both (But I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m right!).My view is the shorts holding back the stock price is an opportunity for odd to buy back judiciously as the price comes under pressure. I&#39;m a tad disappointed that only $10m was bought up to earnings (out of the $140m available), particularly given CEO/OH asserted in his prepared remarks that the price offered &#39;incredible value&#39;, but I believe management (CEO and CFO) knows what it is doing and is likely keeping its powder dry as a hedge against the shorts. That said, after very good results a few days&#39; ago, it would be good if they added ~$30m of the $140m at &lt;$40.Do either of you know what the bear case for the shorts is?! 30% is huge, so shorts should have a compelling case beyond Israeli tech/consumer being stretched etc."

I saw this and wondered if a slow down might have occurred at ODD. \nAfter the  close today ELF is down 10% after reporting their performance. I have not reviewed their results as of yet. \nI&#39;m convinced the huge short position in ODD is the problem. Stock is heavy w/ institutional and insider ownership. It lacks liquidity and the shorts know this. They have mngmt pinned knowing they can&#39;t sell and institutions see no reason to add. \nCo CFO is from Goldman,  who I believe banked the IPO. I&#39;ve been investing long enough to know that Goldman will enable shorts. It is going to take several more quarters of good earnings to shed  these shorts. They are shorting 30% + of the float. Buy back news -upped guidance didn&#39;t help. I sold 3/4 my position w/great reluctance but also with measured prudence. I hope this Mngmt team knows how to deal with these shorts.
