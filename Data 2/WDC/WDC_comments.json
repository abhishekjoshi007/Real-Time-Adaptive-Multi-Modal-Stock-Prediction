That’s why WDC trades as if the Flash business is worthless.\n\nIn a spin-off, the parentco’s stock usually drops by the value of the spinco stock. E.g. in a 1-for-1 spin, ParentCo stock would go from $65 to $55 if the spinco stock trades at $10 on ex-date…\n\nBut that’s not always the case. Once in a while, the parentco stock doesn’t drop at all, and might even rise. It’s rare. Why? This happens when the spinco is a huge profit or cashflow drag on the parentco. See the LAAC/LAC spin-off - the parentco surged after they spun off the valuable but troublesome spinco. And this lifted the concerns on the parentco so the stock jumped.\n\nIf I’m right that WDC gets no respect becos of Sandisk, then I won’t be surprised if WDC is flat or up after they spin off the Flash biz (which is dragging the stock down lately)"

WD has been a great company but waiting for the data revolution provided by the current big data approach to AI that is forever hungry for more data, and that enables apps and business models that are data-centric which produce and consume even more data. But just like the CD ROM that had its day, SSD now has a lower cost of ownership than HDD when you consider (a) its tiny power use and even tinier resting parasitic consumption and (b) its much smaller size. And that is forgetting that it is the tortoise and the hare comparison for speed needed by AI and any cloud app. One more generation of shrink and the cost of SSD per bit will be the same. So, HDD will be retired. Given that, WD only has its NAND side. This would be the real reason for splitting the company i.e. a clear view through the crystal ball. Same happened to vacuum tube monitors/TVs around 2008. Mechanical stuff will always be replaced by solid state if that is possible. It is happening now accelerated by AI. And that is why, after a lot of thinking this thru, I have stopped investing in WD as it really is a value trap that will then devalue after perhaps a short term pop. But the reason it has been going down is that the institutions see clearly that HDD will be retired soon and it is going to be hard to support WD&#39;s value if you write that side of the business off. But if you split it then writing off is an easier exercise."

Hence WD also slid. I believe that WD is ahead of the earnings curve compared to MU right now and note that they overlap only on SSD. MU has HBM and DRAM whereas WD has HDD. WD has no tech that the US will ban to be exported to China so that is safe. Also, HDD requirements grow with long term data storage whereas SSD / DRAM / HBM grows with AI compute growth as they work as a team. So, I am going to say that WD is a safe more undervalued stock for now, but MU will overtake that after its next earnings not forgetting that big league investors still treat MU as cyclical DRAM earnings with HBM being only 10% of their revenue right now. So, my strategy for the next couple of months will be to get in and out of WD depending on macro conditions, then switch to MU before their next earnings. This is not being fickle btw, but realistic and strategic as my only goal is capital growth."

Every time, since 2020, that Bain has tried to IPO Kioxia, it takes them so long to get their ducks in a row that the market opportunity passes them by.WDC is now at almost 4 YEARS for the plan to split Flash/NAND and HDD.  4 YEARS!!!!

And most stocks are on 20 to 40 forward PE if a risk plan pans out. So, complete technical and execution safety, no risk, guaranteed earnings and low PE, and massive AI growth as data storage requirements go exponential.

Complete waste of shareholder equity - but zero sweat off their backs.   But they probably make larger incentives while shuffling their feet delaying the separation."

What in the world does this company have to do to make a real move above levels it achieved over a decade ago while other tech is up hundreds or thousands of percent since then? Seagate Technology (STX) is collaborating with its cloud partners to secure qualifications for its products in the cloud segment, Chief Financial Officer Gianluca Romano said at a technology conference Wednesday.The process is taking longer than expected due to the rigorous demands placed on the products, especially in core environments. But, the company has the ball rolling and is making good progress every week, Romano said, according to a Capital IQ transcript.The qualification process for the cloud segment may extend into the next quarter, but the company has made significant advancements in the on-premise data center, a crucial market segment where artificial intelligence-driven demand is expected to increase the consumption in the coming quarters.The company is confident in its heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, product despite delays and has begun working with multiple cloud customers in the US and China, expecting the full qualification process in around three quarters, with a ramp-up in volume expected by mid-2025, the executive said.HAMR&#39;s impact on profitability will remain limited until mid-2025"

But you can get the gist of it&#34;We think these are better separate assets, especially around that they&#39;re executing extremely long. And so I think we started down our process. We announced it October 30 of last year. It&#39;s on a very big base inside the company with Super companies got 50,000-plus it’s -- it&#39;s 2 big franchises, we mean gibbon our path and we expect to getting to the plants month early October and we&#39;ve got all of our IT systems separated. We&#39;ve got our self-organized and where we can start operating 2 separate companies and make sure we can process orders, make sure we collect on in a road on an attributable to 2 separate businesses. It&#39;s called the soft spin in the parlance of people that do spins all the time. And we&#39;ll execute in that mode for the next quarter through the December quarter. And then when we get through that, we get conviction, we can close the books on 2 independent public companies. We&#39;ll do that most likely through the December quarter and then we&#39;ll go through the separation process. So a very long process.&#34;It&#39;s already been a long process (really 3+ years) and still going longer."

Like today up 2.4% at time of posting, Monday probably down 5%. Actually I just bought and sold Intel 2 days ago at a small profit, then it posts terrible news of massive restructuring likely to happen and it goes up 10% starting about 2 secs after I sold. This market really makes not sense at all. But, long term data only grows and drives do not last forever ( at least not yet ) though admittedly SSD if it is only written to occasionally and read a lot ( typical for big data ) then that could be a technical headwind at some point in the distant future. I would really love to find a support level for WDC to buy into, but it seems to be one of those large swing stocks. Right now it is somewhere in the middle. So, short term back down or more up?"

Forward PE of 6, next 5 years at least 20% CAGR, and well placed for any further AI tailwinds as the volume of data stored soars exponentially and then trailing that a few years is the need to replace all of that storage cyclically, and cherry on top analysts are pricing this stock at $100 in next 12 months. Is everyone just standing around looking at each other waiting for the first to move? Or is it recent history that is holding this back? I checked sales and earnings growth for the last 5 quarters and it is impressive. I would guess margins are just going to improve with increased demand and economy of scale, and volumes will go up with more manufacturing capacity. Looks to me like it is time for this stock to shine and grow rather than follow earlier pre-AI era cyclical sales."

If you do apples to apples comparison of HDD business as of now WDC is BETTER than STX. As pointed out by others better revs, GM, growth, etc. So Basically WDC NAND business has a valuation of AT LEAST NEGATIVE $200 million or even more negative. This is a NAND business that WDC bought for well over $15 billion almost 10 years ago that has grown in size and scale since then. WDC NAND will be worth well over $20 billion if this NAND cycle ever takes hold and AI on the edge ever takes off. That means almost a doubling of stock price. I just cannot believe this share price action lately. Buying the stock now seems like a layup.  Just completely mind boggling....WDC, PLEASE ANNOUNCE THE DETAILS OF THE DARN SEPARATION PLAN SOON!!!!!!!!!!!"

Every time I get in it has been stable and going up. Then next day it plummets. OK I am only down about $1200 now by hitting the sell button on a hair trigger. Just bought again on the slow way up at 57 and wham its down 1% in seconds. Is there any bottom to this in sight or are we going down to mid 40&#39;s again like last year? I mean this stock should be going up given solid earnings for the foreseable future and a forward PE of less than 10. But investors can still sell it down to 40s if that is what they want. Why would anyone want that though? Can you get a nicer stock? Please what am I missing? Otherwise I just get out and forget this stock as one of those cursed ones that goes down while its earnings go up and other stocks have crazy high valuations. Really makes no sense, but that is the market for you :) Any suggestions would be appreciated.Know what, I&#39;m out and walking away from the market for a couple of weeks. Lost 6 months slowly won gains this week in four trades. Each one plummeted just after buying. It&#39;s the market itself that is plummeting and there is no way to know when the downwards stair-casing will stop. I love WDC tec, and actually I love Intel&#39;s tech moving fowards. But the market does not. Time to wait it out and join the sideline crowd before I am out of money ... And of course it starts to recover the moment I sell it. Of course."

However, after the next quarter there will be more confidence on performance and growth and that the short term forward PE is actually 10. Sales will ramp year after year because the market has been transformed by AI that consumes data that you need to store. This is just exponential growth due to increase in AI compute and apps and users including company data and output processed results. Growth until the end of the decade is impossible to avoid, but it can be ignored for another quarter or maybe two. I am much more interested to guess when this stock will stop dropping based upon the historical performance and investor bias than the long term thesis. I just want to figure out where the bottom is so that I can get in fully. This is the best AI stock and product category. data Data DATA."

Yet, there is still no firm commitment to actually do it. $500Mill of shareholder equity gone - that&#39;s real cash expenses. Now, we also have to pay for dis-synergies!!!  And they still pay themselves generously on the backs of shareholders for such great performance: that&#39;s the variable compensation expenses going up and whacking away at EPS.

The stock is certainly worth $80 with a forward PE of 10, and analysts seem to agree. I believe the AI market will grow the data storage market by minimum 30% annually and likely more than that for a few years. So, how far down is this going before its value becomes clearly obvious? Basic calculations give it minimum $80 in a high growth AI data driven market with awesome financials. The last few years have not been great but the landscaped changed with &#34;AI everything&#34;. And that means data, Data, DATA. Am I too early still to be looking at investing? Also, the last two days market correction have not helped of course.Could it be that nobody really believes that quarterly earnings from now on will be growing from $1.70 and will likely be at $4 in a couple of years i.e. $16 yearly. Thats got to be a $200 stock then. So, one good earnings is not enough is that it?"

Data is the driving force and is never discarded i.e. will always grow. And the more compute installed the more data is created and consumed. Compute total addressable markets work on rate of data which may one day reach an upper limit and may already be slowing. Storage is cumulative sum of data and there is no upper limit and with more compute comes more data and more apps bring more people&#39;s data online so data increase is accelerating. I believe your numbers, and they may be conservative. Margins will be pressured upwards as demand accelerates as well well as cost advantages with increased sales. And of course the more data that is maintained then the more drives get replaced within a lifecycle as a secondary market that is forever.Data storage is the real AI story and is future proof and safe."

WDC HDD grew 55% y/y vs STX HDD growth of 25% y/y. Note that WDC HDD will trade on its own after the spin-off so investors can own it (instead of STX) \n\n3) $5.6B in net debt will likely drop significantly as the convertible falls off. Here’s why.\n\nWDC issued $1.6B in convertible debt last year to retire an older convert. \n\nThis new convert has a conversion price of $52/share but WDC hedged it with a call spread at $70/share. In plain English, the accounting rules require WDC to increase the fully diluted share count by 23M (1600/70) whenever the stock price rises above the $70 hedge so as to assume full conversion from debt into shares BUT it doesn’t get to assume the $1.6B debt will go away upon conversion. So they took the hit for share dilution but not the benefit of $5.6B in net debt falling to $4B (if/when the debt is converted, which will happen as long as the stock is above $52/share)"

I won’t be surprised if the stock closes in the green tomorrow :) Here’s what the after-hours sellers are missing….\n\nTL;DR EPS guidance was solid, WDC HDD is hitting it out of the park and net debt is likely to go down significantly.\n\n1) EPS guidance is actually a lot better than it looks\n\nGuide for EPS $1.70 midpoint (vs $1.73 consensus) looks like a miss but it includes three non-operating items that are not in consensus numbers:\n\na) $15-25M in separation costs\n\nb) 15-17% tax rate vs 8% expected\n\nc) Higher share count 360M vs 349M\n\nThese non-operating costs add up to a $0.25 hit to the EPS guide i.e. the apples-to-apples guide is $0.22 above consensus. And likely conservative given the past pattern of crushing their own guidance…"
