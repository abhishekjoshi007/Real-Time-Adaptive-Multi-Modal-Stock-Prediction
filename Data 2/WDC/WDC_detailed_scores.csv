Yahoo,2024-10-05,"Here is my take as an R&amp;D engineer and hobby investor. WD has been a great company but waiting for the data revolution provided by the current big data approach to AI that is forever hungry for more data, and that enables apps and business models that are data-centric which produce and consume even more data. But just like the CD ROM that had its day, SSD now has a lower cost of ownership than HDD when you consider (a) its tiny power use and even tinier resting parasitic consumption and (b) its much smaller size. And that is forgetting that it is the tortoise and the hare comparison for speed needed by AI and any cloud app. One more generation of shrink and the cost of SSD per bit will be the same. So, HDD will be retired. Given that, WD only has its NAND side. This would be the real reason for splitting the company i.e. a clear view through the crystal ball. Same happened to vacuum tube monitors/TVs around 2008. Mechanical stuff will always be replaced by solid state if that is possible. It is happening now accelerated by AI. And that is why, after a lot of thinking this thru, I have stopped investing in WD as it really is a value trap that will then devalue after perhaps a short term pop. But the reason it has been going down is that the institutions see clearly that HDD will be retired soon and it is going to be hard to support WD&#39;s value if you write that side of the business off. But if you split it then writing off is an easier exercise.",Neutral,0,0.9887517094612122,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-30,"btw just to follow my post below, I do not yet hold this stock due to its daily wild fluctuations and the sentiment that seems to indicate it will go down before it goes up. Like today up 2.4% at time of posting, Monday probably down 5%. Actually I just bought and sold Intel 2 days ago at a small profit, then it posts terrible news of massive restructuring likely to happen and it goes up 10% starting about 2 secs after I sold. This market really makes not sense at all. But, long term data only grows and drives do not last forever ( at least not yet ) though admittedly SSD if it is only written to occasionally and read a lot ( typical for big data ) then that could be a technical headwind at some point in the distant future. I would really love to find a support level for WDC to buy into, but it seems to be one of those large swing stocks. Right now it is somewhere in the middle.

As pointed out by others better revs, GM, growth, etc. So Basically WDC NAND business has a valuation of AT LEAST NEGATIVE $200 million or even more negative. This is a NAND business that WDC bought for well over $15 billion almost 10 years ago that has grown in size and scale since then. WDC NAND will be worth well over $20 billion if this NAND cycle ever takes hold and AI on the edge ever takes off. That means almost a doubling of stock price.

Yahoo,2024-08-02,"guys, I need some kind of inspirational guidance here. I have 3 times jumped into and out of WDC since after earnings. Every time I get in it has been stable and going up. Then next day it plummets. OK I am only down about $1200 now by hitting the sell button on a hair trigger. Just bought again on the slow way up at 57 and wham its down 1% in seconds. Is there any bottom to this in sight or are we going down to mid 40&#39;s again like last year? I mean this stock should be going up given solid earnings for the foreseable future and a forward PE of less than 10. But investors can still sell it down to 40s if that is what they want. Why would anyone want that though? Can you get a nicer stock? Please what am I missing? Otherwise I just get out and forget this stock as one of those cursed ones that goes down while its earnings go up and other stocks have crazy high valuations. Really makes no sense, but that is the market for you :) Any suggestions would be appreciated.Know what, I&#39;m out and walking away from the market for a couple of weeks. Lost 6 months slowly won gains this week in four trades. Each one plummeted just after buying. It&#39;s the market itself that is plummeting and there is no way to know when the downwards stair-casing will stop. I love WDC tec, and actually I love Intel&#39;s tech moving fowards. But the market does not. Time to wait it out and join the sideline crowd before I am out of money ... And of course it starts to recover the moment I sell it.

Yet, there is still no firm commitment to actually do it. $500Mill of shareholder equity gone - that&#39;s real cash expenses. Now, we also have to pay for dis-synergies!!!

Yahoo,2024-08-02,"OK as a newbie to this stock having just lost 3.8% since I got in yesterday and certainly jumped out already today. The stock is certainly worth $80 with a forward PE of 10, and analysts seem to agree. I believe the AI market will grow the data storage market by minimum 30% annually and likely more than that for a few years. So, how far down is this going before its value becomes clearly obvious? Basic calculations give it minimum $80 in a high growth AI data driven market with awesome financials. The last few years have not been great but the landscaped changed with &#34;AI everything&#34;. And that means data, Data, DATA. Am I too early still to be looking at investing? Also, the last two days market correction have not helped of course.Could it be that nobody really believes that quarterly earnings from now on will be growing from $1.70 and will likely be at $4 in a couple of years i.e. $16 yearly.

TL;DR EPS guidance was solid, WDC HDD is hitting it out of the park and net debt is likely to go down significantly.

1) EPS guidance is actually a lot better than it looks

Guide for EPS $1.70 midpoint (vs $1.73 consensus) looks like a miss but it includes three non-operating items that are not in consensus numbers:

a) $15-25M in separation costs

b) 15-17% tax rate vs 8% expected

c) Higher share count 360M vs 349M

These non-operating costs add up to a $0.25 hit to the EPS guide i.e. the apples-to-apples guide is $0.22 above consensus. And likely conservative given the past pattern of crushing their own guidanceâ€¦",Positive,1,1.0,Main
