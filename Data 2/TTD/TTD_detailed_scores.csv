Yahoo,2024-10-05,I’m short TTD. Why not right? Absurd valuation. These shorts have tended to work out for me with the exception of cava and ge annd Ctas  and wing. Otherwise celh and intc and pins and arkk and intu and cmg have worked out pretty darn well to name just a few. Overall im pretty content shorting overvalued names especially after my China names have rallied some handsomely last month. More than happy to take some of those gains to bet on names like TTD. TTD basically trades north of 100x earnings. Shouldn’t you longs expect to only earn 1% a year using those figures? I own stocks like dal and cpa and cig and ATKR at the moment which all trade like 5-6x earnings. My expectation owning these names is to earn say 20% a year as they all have dominant market positions and trade cheap. So good luck owning your 1% earnings yield in TTD. Not sure it’s good work out too well.Good job by the TTD ceo on that 2016 performance equity award where he is currently sitting on gains on 20 million shares. Good job board. TTD’s business model seems crazy to me where they are now sitting on $3 billion of receivables and the company is saying they are all money good.

Representatives for The Trade Desk did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Work on the project began during the pandemic, and has progressed largely in secret. People working on the project include former senior Roku employees, and at least some team members have been hiding the fact that they are employed by The Trade Desk on LinkedIn. Altogether, The Trade Desk is said to have dozens of people working on the project.

The Trade Desk has been pitching its smart TV OS to multiple hardware makers, with multiple sources telling me that the company is promising much more advantageous revenue sharing deals than its established competition. The company is also said to give hardware partners more leeway in customizing the user interface of the OS than companies like Roku and Amazon typically do.
