TTD does $600 million in sales last quarter earned $85 million and has $2.9 billion in receivables. TTD is not a bank. Why is it acting like a stock exchange where is settles trades by extending credit 60 days to its participants? TTD’s answer to its high A/R balance is to simply run a high A/P balance which clearly runs the risk of alienating its vendors. TTD’s payables only get paid if those receivables are collectible.

One trademark of strong companies is growing into valuations, TTD has done this time and time again, and will continue doing so.I recall when I first bought TTD back in 2019, there was a young smart savvy investor named kenneth saying this is a potential $ trillion company and anyone holding 40-50 (500 split adjusted) shares will be a millionaire in 15 years. He might be a bit too optimistic about the time frame, I thought 15-20 years then. TTD is on track to achieve the feat in about 15 years with solid 22-25% annual growth."

Bad opaque business model (heck go read the auditors report on the difficulty in auditing revenue recognition) TTD has an insanely greedy ceo who cares little for shareholders, stock trades at a ridiculous price to sales equally ridiculous price to earnings. Yeah. Shorting TTD is easy"

Otherwise celh and intc and pins and arkk and intu and cmg have worked out pretty darn well to name just a few. Overall im pretty content shorting overvalued names especially after my China names have rallied some handsomely last month. More than happy to take some of those gains to bet on names like TTD. TTD basically trades north of 100x earnings. Shouldn’t you longs expect to only earn 1% a year using those figures? I own stocks like dal and cpa and cig and ATKR at the moment which all trade like 5-6x earnings. My expectation owning these names is to earn say 20% a year as they all have dominant market positions and trade cheap. So good luck owning your 1% earnings yield in TTD. Not sure it’s good work out too well.Good job by the TTD ceo on that 2016 performance equity award where he is currently sitting on gains on 20 million shares. Good job board. TTD’s business model seems crazy to me where they are now sitting on $3 billion of receivables and the company is saying they are all money good. Company offers 30 to 60 days to pay those receivables. Time will tell how well TTD extends customers credit and acting like a bank to those who use the platform. Personally at some point I’d say it blows up epically but can’t say when"

The company has been secretly building its own smart TV operating system, and aims to license it to device makers that don&#39;t want to run Google TV, Amazon&#39;s Fire TV OS or Roku&#39;s OS, I have been able to confirm with five sources with knowledge of the company&#39;s plans.\n\nRepresentatives for The Trade Desk did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nWork on the project began during the pandemic, and has progressed largely in secret. People working on the project include former senior Roku employees, and at least some team members have been hiding the fact that they are employed by The Trade Desk on LinkedIn. Altogether, The Trade Desk is said to have dozens of people working on the project.\n\nThe Trade Desk has been pitching its smart TV OS to multiple hardware makers, with multiple sources telling me that the company is promising much more advantageous revenue sharing deals than its established competition. The company is also said to give hardware partners more leeway in customizing the user interface of the OS than companies like Roku and Amazon typically do. It is said to have signed up at least one partner thus far, and a first device running the OS could launch as early as next year."
