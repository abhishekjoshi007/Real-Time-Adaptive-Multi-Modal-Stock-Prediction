If your call expires inthemoney, your broker should exercise it for you. But beware! You will need enough cash to actually buy the shares! Same goes for when you exercise the call early. If I were you, I would set a limit sell order and slowly adjust it lower until I hit 5.47. At some point a bot should jump at it, considering thats where premium is 0. If you dont get a fill above 5.47, it would be better to exercise early. But exercising always carries an overnight risk. Because it is settled after hours and you can only sell the shares in the morning. Just keep that in mind."

If you dont have the cash, your institution would immediately liquidate leaving you with the proceeds. Or You can wait till expiry, if you are still ITM you will automatically exercise, paying 44x100xstrike and liquidating at earliest available time, leaving you once again with the difference as profit. Options are dumb in that the better you do, the less of the unrealized gains you are able to actually realize. Nobody wants to pay that premium for Options so deep itm that they dont feel has much more to go. If they are confident in the stock, they will just buy cheaper less itm or even otm options. Frankly, when my Options get too deep itm, I exercise then rebuy Options immediately as you are possibly going to lose value over time as they depreciate."

Youre coming to the wrong place for answers. These people in here are idiots. Youre sitting here asking if you gotta have a buyer to exercise your 44 call options lmao. Whoever sold you those call options, thats whos shares youd be taking. Options are a zero sum game period, if you gain 100 shares someone else lost them. Secondly if your calls are in the money they will not expire worthless, period. The broker will either exercise for you and immediately make you sell the shares if you do not have the capital or in some cases they will sell the options for you. If this happens and volume is that low its very likely youll get a dog shit full price. Id try to sell them before that, you need to lower the price and see if any will sell. Bidask spreads are usually ridiculously wide on low volume options. Even though their may be good opportunities on low liquidity options sometimes, this is exactly why nobody trades them. You have to have a buyer."

Yes if you have enough margin to cover the purchase. But some brokers can have all sort of additional stringent rules around margin requirements. Regulators only set the minimum rules and brokers can go as stringent as they want and can also change them on the fly. Some mentioned that the broker can even do it for me i.e. buy and sell at exactly the same time, meaning I dont need any funds to do so... is that a possibility for some brokers? obviously I will have to call and confirm with them. Yes, thats a possibility with some brokers. In reality, they still do take on a risk doing that, because there are several hours between when settlement occurs and when market resumes trading. For options that expire on Fridays, the settlement actually happens on Saturday many hours after the market has closed and trading doesnt start for more than 24 hours later. The stock can open with a gap up or down when trading resumes. Thats the risk the broker is taking. The risk being that your account gets wiped out and the broker is left carrying the rest of the loss. Brokers with deep pockets can take those risks to offer smoother services to their clients."

Selling the option should theoretically always yield a higher return, since you are receiving a premium on top of the intrinsic value of the shares. Lets use 4 strike, and a 9.47 share price. Im ignoring the initial cash you paid for the contracts since thats fixed either way. Scenario 1 Exercise and sell the options. Purchase the shares for 17,600, and then sell for 41,668 which gives a profit of 24,068 Scenario 2 Sell the options contracts for 6. This gives a profit of 26,400. The equilibrium point where both scenarios yield the same return is when the following equation is equal. Strike Premium Current Stock Price, where S is your strike of 4, premium is the cost per contract you want to buysell at, and current stock price is self explanatory."

                    "text": "Im going to try to explain the jargon and answer this as clearly and thoroughly as I can. The answer to your first question is entirely dependent on which broker you are using and how your account is set up. The worst thing you can do here is nothing. You are right that open interest means that there are 1700ish open orders for that call contract. However, the bid or the highest price anyone is willing to pay looks like its about 20 cents below the ask or the lowest price anyone is willing to sell. If you want to close your position immediately and the bid price is acceptable to you, you can put your order through to sell all of the contracts at whatever the current bid price is and they will sellclose almost immediately at that price. You will not be maximizing your profits, but youll immediately end your position in this trade and make a nice profit. Since you are very new to this, this is the choice I would recommend. You are potentially leaving some additional profit on the table, but if youre happy with the profit so far, this strategy makes the most sense and immediately ends your risk of the underlying stock moving against you and the option price dropping. Your other choice is to exercise the contract and buy the shares. Even for calls that are deep in the money, this is pretty much never a good idea. You will need to have the cash in your account, or if you have a margin account, you will need to borrow the money from your broker and pay interest to buy the shares. You will be massively increasing your investment and your exposure to price movements. If you paid 500 for these contracts, the most you could lose is 500 if they expire worthless. If you buy the shares and the company goes bankrupt, you will have lost the total value of the shares you bought. Your last choice is to do nothing and see what your brokerage does. If youre even considering this, I would recommend closing your account after this trade and putting your money into a managed fund like a 401k or IRA. When you opened a brokerage account you decided to make decisions about your money. These are not managed accounts, we are the managers, we have to make these decisions. I dont know how anyone on here would recommend not putting an order in to your broker to do something. If you dont tell your broker what to do, they would be completely justified in letting your calls expire worthless and you will lose your entire investment. They may have a policy in place that they will try to close them for you at the best price they can get, but I wouldnt rely on that. You should look into something called theta decay when youre done with this, basically the options market understands that huge fluctuations in stock prices are rare. So as a contract nears its expiration date, its value decreases even if the underlying stocks price doesnt change. When youre buying puts and calls, your profit potential is based on the uncertainty of the price of the stock, and as you get closer to the expiration date, the stock price becomes more predictable and the value of the options decreases. You should consider this when deciding when it is best to close your positions. oh, and can you do a cashless exercise? maybe, thats up to you and your broker. Again, that would not be my choice. And can you exercise your options buy the shares and sell them the same day usually yes as long as you have not been flagged as a pattern day trader. I think if you make more than 4 day trades buying and selling an asset within one trading day in a 5 day period and your account has less than 25k in it, then your broker will flag you as a pattern day trader and youll need to wait a day to sell."
