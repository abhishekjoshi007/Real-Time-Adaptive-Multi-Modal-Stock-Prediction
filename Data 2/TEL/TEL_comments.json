As for recent events including the failed ballistic attack from Iran the market got the impression that Israel wont suffer any major attack that can harm its economy. American taxpayers have been helping even though Israel is spending a lot of money of buying goods from America anyway Ill summarize for the haters israel still consider as a nice and reliable economy that survived a lot of of punches , even though the gov is shit the private sector have qualities second to the US only . Time will tell how the market will respond In the meantime Ill keep investing in 125 and Israeli stocks as there is always gems and the big boys taking time to find them"

Bush II wanted his own little gulf war. So, my conclusion to you is that yes, it was a burden on the economy, to say the least. However, its what our economy is built around, so we would have been fine. Had it not been for subprime lending and a host of other factors that came together at the same time. We still have those housing loans on the treasury books btw. MBS have been carried forward indefinitely to roll them off the books, and last I remember hearing about it this year they account for 1t of the 2t defecit or some such nonsense. Regardless, I dont think thats a terrible thing, just that that mistake is still not completely wiped off our economy still."

My point is that they dont do it to get out of working from their perspective, they are working on the most important project to them, mind you the sanctification of Yisrael.

He told me they receive less than 300month for him, his wife and their 4 daughters... He often works oneoff jobs to afford dentalmedical care for his kids. As is, my friends teeth are decaying and falling out because he cant afford any dental care of his own. Your post implies these people are lazy freeloaders that are taking advantage of a system when thats not the case. These people are hard workers sacrificing wealth for what they deem to be the purity of their soul. Something that, as a secular American, I can hardly fathom. But they arent getting out of work by any stretch of the imagination. I wont even go into the fact that living in a kibbutz means youre farming and doing other manual labor every single day.

And although the book hasnt changed, society has, which changes how the words are interpreted and applied. Its a dynamic relationship that is constantly changing thanks to rabbinic discourse theres a rich, documented history PROVING this fact. The book hasnt changed, the discourse surrounding the book has, and Jews have a moral obligation to participate. Acting like Americans dont study their religious texts AND get real jobs Yeah, thats exactly what Im saying. America is a Christian nation, its faith based, your salvation is determined by a personal relationship you have with Jesus rather than how you act in your community. This is fundamentally different than Judaism, in which salvation is entirely predicated on action. Trying to compare how Americans heathens, truly practice religion to how Orthodox Jews practice it is one of the most wild comparisons Ive seen made. The entire history of Judaism is so diametrically opposed to the average Americans historylife that to compare how Americans practice religion to how Jews do is asinine. Theres a world of cultural differences, none the least of which being that Americans arent actively fighting for their right to exist based on their religious practices nor have they ever had to do so, not once in history. Youre smallminded af. Also, it doesnt matter but my friend is one of the kindest people Ive ever met, he would never harm a Palestinian child.

Hes a 50something year old man thatll break down in tears discussing how Palestinians are treated without ever mentioning how Jews are treated. Him being a Jew and Israeli, in his eyes, give him only the right to be critical of judaismIsrael, hes not the type to hate on Palestine and if you ever met him you would immediately understand how absurd your comment is. But you will never meet Ben or anyone like Ben because your ignorance presupposes that these people dont exist. You know nothing of the people you spew hate towards, so why spew hate at all? Your entire argument is based on gross oversimplifications of both people and religious practices. Rather than recognizing the complexity latent in these ancient dilemmas, youre spewing shallow divisive rhetoric.

If I wanted to, I could close my eyes and never think about Israel again without making a single material change to my life. And I certainly never said Israel doesnt have its own problems it has many. My comments are strictly directed to YOUR comparison between how grown Israeli ultraorthodox Jews practice their religion versus how American children do... Scroll up. OP asked how ultra orthodox which excludes American Jews, mind you afford to not work. I told them by living in poverty and in communities. This is the answer. The few shekels they get from the government doesnt sustain them, their community does and the subsidies soften the blow. If you took the 50month per person my friend receives from the government away, nothing would change. He would still work odd jobs and live in his kibbutz with his family. And at 50month, its not even a subsidy. Every Israeli serves their country as you correctly pointed out, the ultra religious dont go to war, but theyre still conscripted to serve in hospitalsclinicsschools or other such ways. They paid it forward. Everything else said is a direct response to something you brought up out of nowhere. Meaning at most, Im negating your position and not putting forth any position of my own. I havent said a lick about MY views of Israel or the conflict, aside from saying that I think its complex are you going to say its not?. Although you may be right about my friend being in the minority amongst the ultraorthodoxy Ill concede this much, religious Israelis tend to be prosettlements, youre not right in all your baseless slander hes lazy, he hates Palestinians, he doesnt contribute to society, etc of someone I actually do know quite well. Thats literally all Im saying. In fact, if you were to randomly select an Israeli, the odds are that your description wouldnt fit them. Youre being shallow. How do I know? Because I happen to know a reallife counter example to your claims, hence your claims cannot reflect reality but only a subset of it AKA shallow. Youre literally just slandering for the sake of slandering."

Looking at the Palestinian cause as a whole, the fact remains that Hamas stole billions and billions of dollars from the Palestinian people and used it to start a war they couldnt possibly win. Before that, the PLO did the same. Separately, Hezbollah has been doing the same up north. All of these groups were elected to power and have a lot of support.

The part Israelis deny is that they expelled these people for ethnic reasons. This is a fact they cannot face, because it fully implicates them in the entire conflict, and they cannot blame it on the victims who are refugees now under blockade and bombardment in places like Gaza. The onus on accepting peace is not on the occupied and displaced. Its on Israel as the occupying and displacing power, if peace has not been achieved its because the legitimate grievances of the refugees has not been met by Israel, a major one of which is right of return, ignoring the fact that Israel has never in no negotiations offered a fully soverign palestinian state and is currently building Jewish only settlements all over it."

Even the person who coined the term nakba to refer to 1948 never once says in their book The Meaning of Disaster that the Arabs fled he always refers to them as the Arabs or Arabs of Palestine, never as Palestinians, which is very interesting. We also have quotes from the prime minister of Syria about how the Arabs ran away based on the instructions of the Arab legion high command. There was a war going on and Jews and Arabs were both running away from conflict area or were caught in fighting. Thats part of why war is terrible. But it doesnt means that the narrative of the Nakba that there was some sort of plan or concerted effort to kick Arabs out. If that was the case why did Israel accept 150000200000 Arabs in its borders at the end of the war of independence? Also, you only mention the Arabs that were displaced during the war. Dont the Jewish communities that were expelled, like gush etzion, during the war deserve the same amount of focus? Or does that not fit the narrative?"

                    "text": "Youre denying it now, proving my point. 750,000 Arabs did not run away because of legion high command and the history is fully clear on this. They fled for their lives in response to a violent depopulation campaign that resulted in over 70 massacres, the destruction of over 500 villages, and brutal violent terror and intimidation tactics by Zionist militia groups like the Haganah, all of which is well documented. This occurred because Israel could not otherwise exist on that land as a Jewish majority demographic state. BenGurion in an address to the central committee of the Histadrut on 30 December 1947 In the area allocated to the Jewish State there are not more than 520,000 Jews and about 350,000 nonJews, mostly Arabs. Together with the Jews of Jerusalem, the total population of the Jewish State at the time of its establishment will be about a million, including almost 40 percent nonJews. Such a population composition does not provide a stable basis for a Jewish State. This demographic fact must be viewed in all its clarity and acuteness. With such a population composition, there cannot even be absolute certainty that control will remain in the hands of the Jewish majority.... There can be no stable and strong Jewish State so long as it has a Jewish majority of only 60 percent. This is also the reason why the refugees are denied return today, because their population would demographically end Israel as a Jewish state, which is the reason they were expelled to begin with. Finally the Nakba of 1948 never ended, it continues to this day in the West Bank, where Arabs are removed from their farms and homes to be given to Jewish settlers, motivated by the same Jewish ethnic entitlement to the land that caused the Nakba. So again these facts are uncomfortable for Israelis to confront because with them they cannot blame the Arabs for what was a fully self serving, violent, fundamentalist, and racist land grab. Instead the Arabs just conveniently fled for fun from their generational villages, farms, and homes, leaving them innocently for the taking by countless Jewish immigrants from Morocco, Russia, and Europe who also conveniently wanted to build a Jewish state on it, or so the ridiculous story goes."

This includes the Jewish communities that had lost their homes from 19481967. Somehow its only unacceptable when its the Arabs that are displaced. When its other groups its just ignored.

There is certainly a desire by Israelis to paint the Arab flight as somehow independent of Zionist conduct, but that is simply absolutely not true. This is not my version of history, this is history. This was also not populations shifting during war, this was an intentional self serving ethnic cleansing campaign, that continues to this day. The result is not the Arab refugees waging a religious war. When youre a refugee from Al Majdal Ashkelon or farms that became Sderot or even the villages that became Kiryat Shimona being rocket blasted in the north, all towns that were violently depopulated by the Haganah and not any legion command orders you can read their history for yourself, now on the other side of the fence in Gaza watching them build settlements on your land while their military blockades you, denies basic goods and rights, and then bombs the shit out of you every 5 years, it doesnt take much for violence to erupt. For them its a revenge and liberation war. Its framed as a religious war by the Israelis, because again this framing absolves them of their very real role in why it exists. Its much easier to propagandize this as religious Islamists waging a war against Jews. Now you become a blameless victim of hate, not the aggressor in the first place. Its impossible to argue this with Israelis or Israeli supporters because their agenda is squarely in supporting Israel regardless of the facts, but I will conclude by saying all of this is well known these days, most people have become aware of it, its why they protest around the world, its why the UN and international courts are watching Israel, its why there are demands for divestment and boycotts, and its why it will become increasingly difficult for the Israeli state to continue to sustain its conduct as time goes on. This country has an absolute garbage global reputation and the good times of land theft and subjugation with impunity are over after this."

Energy is the backbone for almost everything, infrastructure, technology, transportation etc. You missed the agenda of AI energy demands both manufacturing of AI chips and Utilization of those hardware, shift to EV, and much more upcoming demand. Right now both Uranium For nuclear energy and Solar Panels will go up and they will keep going up to move to clean energy. Companies that are into manufacturing or generation of energy is a safe long term bet for wealth growth, but remember we are all in WSB and our end goal is Wendys dumpster because we all want that one good trade of 100 profit even if it is from 1 to 2.
