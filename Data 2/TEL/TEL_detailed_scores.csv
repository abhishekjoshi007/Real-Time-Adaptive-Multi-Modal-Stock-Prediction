Your points only make sense if practicing Judaism is akin to playing video games which is absurd. Every single comparison you make assumes a false equivalence. theres no test and the book hasnt changed... No test... brother its quite literally their soul on the line. And although the book hasnt changed, society has, which changes how the words are interpreted and applied. Its a dynamic relationship that is constantly changing thanks to rabbinic discourse theres a rich, documented history PROVING this fact. The book hasnt changed, the discourse surrounding the book has, and Jews have a moral obligation to participate. Acting like Americans dont study their religious texts AND get real jobs Yeah, thats exactly what Im saying. America is a Christian nation, its faith based, your salvation is determined by a personal relationship you have with Jesus rather than how you act in your community. This is fundamentally different than Judaism, in which salvation is entirely predicated on action. Trying to compare how Americans heathens, truly practice religion to how Orthodox Jews practice it is one of the most wild comparisons Ive seen made. The entire history of Judaism is so diametrically opposed to the average Americans historylife that to compare how Americans practice religion to how Jews do is asinine. Theres a world of cultural differences, none the least of which being that Americans arent actively fighting for their right to exist based on their religious practices nor have they ever had to do so, not once in history. Youre smallminded af. Also, it doesnt matter but my friend is one of the kindest people Ive ever met, he would never harm a Palestinian child.

Hes a 50something year old man thatll break down in tears discussing how Palestinians are treated without ever mentioning how Jews are treated.

But you will never meet Ben or anyone like Ben because your ignorance presupposes that these people dont exist. You know nothing of the people you spew hate towards, so why spew hate at all?

Even the man who coined the term nakba, konstatine Zaryk, never mentions that Arabs were expelled but that they cowerdly ran away. Israel accepted having a state side by side next to an Arab state. The Arabs rejected that and started the war that they lost. The Arabs also expelled and murdered many Jewish communities like gush etzion at that time.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Forcing a population to flee due to whispering campaigns, night time raids, village water poisonings, looting and rapes, terrorist acts, and destruction of property is not a valid excuse for stealing their property after or denying them return, all in the name of creating an ethnostate on land you believe god promised you instead. The part Israelis deny is that they expelled these people for ethnic reasons. This is a fact they cannot face, because it fully implicates them in the entire conflict, and they cannot blame it on the victims who are refugees now under blockade and bombardment in places like Gaza. The onus on accepting peace is not on the occupied and displaced. Its on Israel as the occupying and displacing power, if peace has not been achieved its because the legitimate grievances of the refugees has not been met by Israel, a major one of which is right of return, ignoring the fact that Israel has never in no negotiations offered a fully soverign palestinian state and is currently building Jewish only settlements all over it.",Neutral,0,0.9298940896987915,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-13,"Its less that Israelis deny what youre claiming bc they cant handle it and more that the idea that 750,000 people were forcefully expelled isnt supported by historical data and accounts. Even the person who coined the term nakba to refer to 1948 never once says in their book The Meaning of Disaster that the Arabs fled he always refers to them as the Arabs or Arabs of Palestine, never as Palestinians, which is very interesting. We also have quotes from the prime minister of Syria about how the Arabs ran away based on the instructions of the Arab legion high command. There was a war going on and Jews and Arabs were both running away from conflict area or were caught in fighting. Thats part of why war is terrible. But it doesnt means that the narrative of the Nakba that there was some sort of plan or concerted effort to kick Arabs out. If that was the case why did Israel accept 150000200000 Arabs in its borders at the end of the war of independence? Also, you only mention the Arabs that were displaced during the war. Dont the Jewish communities that were expelled, like gush etzion, during the war deserve the same amount of focus? Or does that not fit the narrative?",Neutral,0,0.9999574422836304,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-13,"Youre denying it now, proving my point. 750,000 Arabs did not run away because of legion high command and the history is fully clear on this. They fled for their lives in response to a violent depopulation campaign that resulted in over 70 massacres, the destruction of over 500 villages, and brutal violent terror and intimidation tactics by Zionist militia groups like the Haganah, all of which is well documented. This occurred because Israel could not otherwise exist on that land as a Jewish majority demographic state. BenGurion in an address to the central committee of the Histadrut on 30 December 1947 In the area allocated to the Jewish State there are not more than 520,000 Jews and about 350,000 nonJews, mostly Arabs. Together with the Jews of Jerusalem, the total population of the Jewish State at the time of its establishment will be about a million, including almost 40 percent nonJews. Such a population composition does not provide a stable basis for a Jewish State. This demographic fact must be viewed in all its clarity and acuteness. With such a population composition, there cannot even be absolute certainty that control will remain in the hands of the Jewish majority.... There can be no stable and strong Jewish State so long as it has a Jewish majority of only 60 percent. This is also the reason why the refugees are denied return today, because their population would demographically end Israel as a Jewish state, which is the reason they were expelled to begin with. Finally the Nakba of 1948 never ended, it continues to this day in the West Bank, where Arabs are removed from their farms and homes to be given to Jewish settlers, motivated by the same Jewish ethnic entitlement to the land that caused the Nakba. So again these facts are uncomfortable for Israelis to confront because with them they cannot blame the Arabs for what was a fully self serving, violent, fundamentalist, and racist land grab. Instead the Arabs just conveniently fled for fun from their generational villages, farms, and homes, leaving them innocently for the taking by countless Jewish immigrants from Morocco, Russia, and Europe who also conveniently wanted to build a Jewish state on it, or so the ridiculous story goes.",Neutral,0,0.9974119961261749,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-13,"I gave you specific first hand sources that claimed that the Arabs fled due to fear of war and the requests made by the Arab high command and Arab leaders. These 8nckude a Syrian historian, a British historian, quoted by the then prime minister of Syria, and I can also include the eye witness testimony between the Jewish mayor of Haifa with Arab leadership and the British military leader who were in the room. You keep saying that your version is history but without any actual sources. None of the firsthand accounts match what you say. And you completely ignore that during war populations shift. This includes the Jewish communities that had lost their homes from 19481967. Somehow its only unacceptable when its the Arabs that are displaced. When its other groups its just ignored. A million Germans were displaced after borders were drawn at the end of ww2. Should they wage a religious war to annihilate their neighbors for t he next 76 years? Does that make any sense to you?",Neutral,0,0.9997789263725281,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-13,"Im sure some Arabs did flee because of that, but thats not the entire story. The majority fled due to Zionist violence and intimidation. There is certainly a desire by Israelis to paint the Arab flight as somehow independent of Zionist conduct, but that is simply absolutely not true. This is not my version of history, this is history. This was also not populations shifting during war, this was an intentional self serving ethnic cleansing campaign, that continues to this day. The result is not the Arab refugees waging a religious war. When youre a refugee from Al Majdal Ashkelon or farms that became Sderot or even the villages that became Kiryat Shimona being rocket blasted in the north, all towns that were violently depopulated by the Haganah and not any legion command orders you can read their history for yourself, now on the other side of the fence in Gaza watching them build settlements on your land while their military blockades you, denies basic goods and rights, and then bombs the shit out of you every 5 years, it doesnt take much for violence to erupt. For them its a revenge and liberation war. Its framed as a religious war by the Israelis, because again this framing absolves them of their very real role in why it exists. Its much easier to propagandize this as religious Islamists waging a war against Jews. Now you become a blameless victim of hate, not the aggressor in the first place. Its impossible to argue this with Israelis or Israeli supporters because their agenda is squarely in supporting Israel regardless of the facts, but I will conclude by saying all of this is well known these days, most people have become aware of it, its why they protest around the world, its why the UN and international courts are watching Israel, its why there are demands for divestment and boycotts, and its why it will become increasingly difficult for the Israeli state to continue to sustain its conduct as time goes on.
