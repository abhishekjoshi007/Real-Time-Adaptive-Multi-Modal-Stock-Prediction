FILL in 400,000, 6.0 interest, 20 down. 80,000. Remember 80,000. The downpayment amount. Remember it. We are going to use the SAME 80k two different ways. Run the amortization chart. You now.have a 320,000 mortgage for 30 years. 2350month. 408,000 in interest, 728,000 total payments. But lets apply that SAME 80,000 differently. Now do 400,000 6 Rate w 5 down 20,000. Not 80,000. Take the rest of the 80k downpayment 60,000 from the downpayment and apply it as a 1 time payment during the first repayment month. Oct 2024. So The loan is now 380,000. But because youre applying 20k down, and the rest of the downpayment as a onetime PRINCIPLE payment, EARLY in the repayment cycle, youre eliminating MORE in interest than youre paying for the difference in downpayment. 20k down, 60k first month payment. Now, youll only be paying 133,000 in interest. Loan 380,000. Pmt2730. 133,000 in total interest paid. Total loan cost 454k principle and interest Time to 0,balance 13 years, 8 months. Try it. Now you see how a 30 year mortgage doesnt have to be a 30 year when you refi and apply money differently. We all were taught that 30 years with 360 payments is the ONLY option we have. Its not. Again. Play with the calculator. Try different repayment strategies. 1. One time 1st or 2nd month lump sum payment. Has a HUGE effect on total interest and time to 0 dollar balancepayoff. 2. One time lump sum 10 years in on a 30 year mortgage. Very marginal effect 3. Extra dollar amount starting with month number 1. Marginal to major effect depending on amount and frequency."

Buffett also has a huge cash pile, so it stands to reason that Buffett will continue to buy more shares if the price drops. That should help create a floor. Today I sold the 57 put with the 823 expiration date. I got 0.37 in premium and the trade lasts one week. So I divide the 0.37 in premium by the 57 strike and I get 0.0065. Then I multiply that by 52, because Im risking the money for one week, and I could do a trade similar to this on this or another company 52 times over the course of a year. And I get an annualized return of 33. Im doing this with one tranche of what Im willing to put into OXY, and I already have three tranches of OXY with a total cost basis of 52.74 per share. This put option reduces my cost basis down to 52.62 per share. If I get assigned the shares at 57 Ill collect the dividend on 910, then sell a covered call at the 57 strike. Heres an example"

I do this on both SPY and TLT. Right now that equates to selling the 540510 put spread on SPY and 9690 put spread on TLT. But what I cant figure out how to do is sell calls consistently for a profit. Being short calls seems to be a losing trade 90 of the time. At the same time Ive come to realize it is the secret sauce to beating SPY returns long term. When the market fell recently I went from 134 to 114 in the same time SPY went from 560 to 510. When it bounced I went from 114 to 135 in the same time SPY went from 510 to 550."

U.S. debt just hit a record 35 trillion This nations gross cumulative debt has hit 35 trillion a number so large, the International Monetary Fund warns that this is unstainable. But its hard to even imagine what the number 35 trillion looks like. So, say you had 35 trillion actual dollar bills, and you put them end to end, starting from the Earths surface. How far up would those dollars reach? Like, maybe, the moon? As it turns out, the moon is not even that big of a jump. It only takes about 2.5 billion dollar bills to get from Earth to the moon. Its no wonder the IMF is worried U.S. debt has boldly gone where no human has gone before. Yeah, 35 trillion is really a big number, said Peter Blair Henry, an economist at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution. To get a sense of just how big the number is, Blair Henry says that you would need to take our dollar bill trail out into the solar system. Call it Debt Trek. Our 35 trillion debt is so huge, our trail of dollars would breeze past Mars, which is 140 million miles away roughly 1.5 trillion dollar bills. The next planet out Jupiter, the giant of the solar system. But not nearly giant enough. It takes roughly 4.5 trillion bills to reach Jupiter. Next up Saturn. But at a measly 9 trillion bills away, on average, even Saturn cant put a ring on U.S. debt. We continue to the outer planets. We pass Uranus and arrive at Neptune. Neptune is just under 30 trillion dollar bills away. Weve reached the last official planet in our solar system, and we still have about 6 trillion in debt to go. Keep in mind, a dollar bill is just over 6 inches long, and 35 trillion of them would reach Pluto. I ran the calculations over and over again because, truly, I was stunned at the absolute absurdity of the size of the US debt. Blair Henry said. What really matters is How big is the debt relative to the size of the economy? And our debt, which has been piling up for decades, is 35 trillion. Right now, our debttoGDP ratio is around 120. We owe a lot more than were actually making thats what worries Blair Henry. As your debt ratio rises, your financing problems just start getting tighter and tighter, he said. And the danger is, at some point, your creditors look at your debt situation and say, Oh my gosh! You are not going to be able to repay me. So those creditors will start demanding higher interest rates when they lend money. Your borrowing costs go up dramatically, and that will ultimately lead to a financial crisis, Blair Henry said. In fact, that has already started to happen. For the U.S., borrowing costs were really low for a long time. The government could basically borrow money for free because people were confident the country would pay it back. The size of the debt didnt seem to matter. But as that debt has ballooned, lenders have started demanding higher interest rates from the U.S. Weve hit a turning point, said Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff. Rogoff was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund for years. He calls the rising US debt a huge economic problem. This is the biggest thing thats happened in the global economy in the last 10 years, he said. Thats because the U.S. has practicallyPluto debt, so even a small jump into more debt gets galactic real fast. The interest payments that we have to make on U.S. debt have soared, he added. I think the interest payments alone is now the equivalent of our US military budget. This year, the interest bill is expected to approach 1 trillion. Thats 1 trillion we cant spend, for instance, on roads, health care or growing the economy. Our debt isnt just big, it is now draining our economic resources. People got this idea that it was just free Dont worry about what your debt is! said Rogoff. Thats the big change thats happened in the world, is a bucket of cold water on this idea that debt doesnt matter. A debt this large, if left unchecked would ultimately obliterate our economy."

When rate cuts begin, cost of shelter mortgage begins dropping as mortgages become cheaper barring an increase in home prices, which are on a downwards trajectory. In recent recessions the increasing affordability is accompanied by an increase in supply and decreasing prices due to rising unemployment or waiting for better rates. If the Fed begins cutting in September I think we quickly see the shelter input drop to negative on the monthlies that will put total CPI hurtling to 0 which, when it gets hit on an annual basis, has coincided with Feds putting the funds rate to 0."

And in cases where builders have approved projects yet delay building, maybe the builder should be taxed or forced to sell the approved project to another builder who can get it built. I think is what will happen is that a recession with high unemployment is going to shift demand so that the price of housing will decline at the same time interest rates are lowered in the next year or two. Then after a year or so of recession, high unemployment and surging homelessness, we may see the start of a building boom and migration to cities that welcome new home construction and job creation."

Businesses rely on debt and debt is locked in for years. So really you have to wait a long time for the impact of lower rates to be felt by businesses. Existing debt has to mature and roll off the books and refinanced at lower rates. I wouldnt expect 50 or 100 bps of rate cuts to have any near term effect on labor market. I think we have a ways to go yet until we know if the Fed can actually nail a soft landing. They have always been successful with taming inflation, but the economy is not something that can be managed easily. It has momentum and many factors that influence it that are hard to balance. The Fed has pretty much always botched the soft landing in the past. And if the Fed cuts too aggressively it could be self fulfilling prophecy. People and businesses will be freaked by the large cuts and start saving and hoarding money instead of spending."

However if a soft landing is achieved then yes this time may be different as we have never played out these set of circumstances before. So again dont confuse causality with correlation and dont be so certain with your predictions. One way or another you will be humbled. EDIT I also just realised your 100 crash postfed pivot statistic is completely wrong just using recent memory. Look at the covid crash March 2020 the fed pivoted and cut interest rates to zero which coincided with the bottom of that particular bear market and led to an almost 2 year long bull run. A second example is in late 2018 the fed announced planned rate hikes but in the summer of 2019 pivoted and cut rates three times stimulating another 2 year bull run until the covid crash.

If your goal is to beat market return as it appears, I would recommend that every few years you do the math for yourself and compare your return against the indexes like VOO, VT, VTI. Most retail investors that pick their own stocks do not, and it is often a game of beating it one year and missing the next. If you enjoy doing analysis and watching your picks, your time doing this isnt worth much consideration. If you dont particularly, or consider it a chore, you would certainly be better off with these indexes for the long run as your time is being spent.

Can you really stay updated on the antitrust lawsuits against it? What about their healthcare ventures? Do you know their lead competitors in their pharmacy business or their plans to grow their virtual telehealth division? Of course, maybe you can convince yourself that the level of research and analysis youve done for each company is sufficient. But I think thatd be a tad bit naive. The amount of analysis is always going to be infinite, and unless you have your own bulletproof definition of what constitutes a good company, Id argue that you may as well just buy more index funds and save yourself the hours of research. Also a more general hot take...how do you know what strong management looks like? Or what a dominant market position looks like? Genuine question, because I am not fully convinced that those are meaningful metrics, although I may be wrong. All of the best companies have phenomenal talent in their Csuite that went to Harvard or Wharton. And they all have significant market capture. I just dont think those metrics should play a significant role in your investment decision. They seem handwavey to me."

It sounds like the opportunity is in finding customers with better credit than the borrowers FICO score would have suggested and capturing that arb. But to capture the arb you have to hold the loan. If you sell the loan to capture the arb, you need to convince someone else to buy it at a premium to the value it would have being measured by the FICO score. Now banks could be buying upstart loans on a premium, but that seems unlikely."

What I find surprising is that lenders are choosing to pay a premium over FICO for UPST loans. For context, I work for a big bank in debt trading. When evaluating a product purchased from a company like UPST you will have the names related to the debt and therefore the FICO of the product, alternatively if it is sizable enough youll have a third party evaluate it. It is not like the FICO is unknown, we would check that step 1. UPST would have to convince the lender to pay a premium to buy UPST loans over another source. That is really abnormal, not impossible, but extremely unlikely. Have you heard of lenders paying a premium for UPST loans? It should be noted that even if they cannot capture the arb they expect, UPST can still be successful. Other people in the comments mentioned the speed and ease of getting a loan. That is an effective niche in the retail personal loan origination space that feeds the secondary market. That alone could keep a company successful. I was just surprised to hear they dont keep many of the loans they originate, since that is the only way you capture the full benefit of a superior risk model."
