Reddit,2024-09-19,"Not necessarily. You can refi to a 15 year, but PLEASE do yourself a favor and look at this. Play with the amortization tab. Below the Update bar. Loan calculator. 1. FILL in 400,000, 6.0 interest, 20 down. 80,000. Remember 80,000. The downpayment amount. Remember it. We are going to use the SAME 80k two different ways. Run the amortization chart. You now.have a 320,000 mortgage for 30 years. 2350month. 408,000 in interest, 728,000 total payments. But lets apply that SAME 80,000 differently. Now do 400,000 6 Rate w 5 down 20,000. Not 80,000. Take the rest of the 80k downpayment 60,000 from the downpayment and apply it as a 1 time payment during the first repayment month. Oct 2024. So The loan is now 380,000. But because youre applying 20k down, and the rest of the downpayment as a onetime PRINCIPLE payment, EARLY in the repayment cycle, youre eliminating MORE in interest than youre paying for the difference in downpayment. 20k down, 60k first month payment. Now, youll only be paying 133,000 in interest. Loan 380,000. Pmt2730. 133,000 in total interest paid. Total loan cost 454k principle and interest Time to 0,balance 13 years, 8 months. Try it. Now you see how a 30 year mortgage doesnt have to be a 30 year when you refi and apply money differently. We all were taught that 30 years with 360 payments is the ONLY option we have. Its not. Again. Play with the calculator. Try different repayment strategies. 1. One time 1st or 2nd month lump sum payment. Has a HUGE effect on total interest and time to 0 dollar balancepayoff. 2. One time lump sum 10 years in on a 30 year mortgage. Very marginal effect 3. Extra dollar amount starting with month number 1. Marginal to major effect depending on amount and frequency.",Neutral,0,0.9999879598617554,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-16,"Ive been trading OXY since last fall. Buffett likes them and holds 255 million shares. Hes been buying more recently when the price has been in the high 50s. Buffett also has a huge cash pile, so it stands to reason that Buffett will continue to buy more shares if the price drops. That should help create a floor. Today I sold the 57 put with the 823 expiration date. I got 0.37 in premium and the trade lasts one week. So I divide the 0.37 in premium by the 57 strike and I get 0.0065. Then I multiply that by 52, because Im risking the money for one week, and I could do a trade similar to this on this or another company 52 times over the course of a year. And I get an annualized return of 33. Im doing this with one tranche of what Im willing to put into OXY, and I already have three tranches of OXY with a total cost basis of 52.74 per share. This put option reduces my cost basis down to 52.62 per share. If I get assigned the shares at 57 Ill collect the dividend on 910, then sell a covered call at the 57 strike.

Reddit,2024-08-14,"The Fed fiddles with interest rates, while US debt burns down the world... U.S. debt just hit a record 35 trillion This nations gross cumulative debt has hit 35 trillion a number so large, the International Monetary Fund warns that this is unstainable. But its hard to even imagine what the number 35 trillion looks like. So, say you had 35 trillion actual dollar bills, and you put them end to end, starting from the Earths surface. How far up would those dollars reach? Like, maybe, the moon? As it turns out, the moon is not even that big of a jump. It only takes about 2.5 billion dollar bills to get from Earth to the moon. Its no wonder the IMF is worried U.S. debt has boldly gone where no human has gone before. Yeah, 35 trillion is really a big number, said Peter Blair Henry, an economist at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution. To get a sense of just how big the number is, Blair Henry says that you would need to take our dollar bill trail out into the solar system. Call it Debt Trek. Our 35 trillion debt is so huge, our trail of dollars would breeze past Mars, which is 140 million miles away roughly 1.5 trillion dollar bills. The next planet out Jupiter, the giant of the solar system. But not nearly giant enough. It takes roughly 4.5 trillion bills to reach Jupiter. Next up Saturn. But at a measly 9 trillion bills away, on average, even Saturn cant put a ring on U.S. debt. We continue to the outer planets. We pass Uranus and arrive at Neptune. Neptune is just under 30 trillion dollar bills away. Weve reached the last official planet in our solar system, and we still have about 6 trillion in debt to go. Keep in mind, a dollar bill is just over 6 inches long, and 35 trillion of them would reach Pluto. I ran the calculations over and over again because, truly, I was stunned at the absolute absurdity of the size of the US debt. Blair Henry said. What really matters is How big is the debt relative to the size of the economy? And our debt, which has been piling up for decades, is 35 trillion. Right now, our debttoGDP ratio is around 120. We owe a lot more than were actually making thats what worries Blair Henry. As your debt ratio rises, your financing problems just start getting tighter and tighter, he said. And the danger is, at some point, your creditors look at your debt situation and say, Oh my gosh! You are not going to be able to repay me. So those creditors will start demanding higher interest rates when they lend money. Your borrowing costs go up dramatically, and that will ultimately lead to a financial crisis, Blair Henry said. In fact, that has already started to happen. For the U.S., borrowing costs were really low for a long time. The government could basically borrow money for free because people were confident the country would pay it back. The size of the debt didnt seem to matter. But as that debt has ballooned, lenders have started demanding higher interest rates from the U.S. Weve hit a turning point, said Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff. Rogoff was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund for years. He calls the rising US debt a huge economic problem. This is the biggest thing thats happened in the global economy in the last 10 years, he said. Thats because the U.S. has practicallyPluto debt, so even a small jump into more debt gets galactic real fast. The interest payments that we have to make on U.S. debt have soared, he added. I think the interest payments alone is now the equivalent of our US military budget. This year, the interest bill is expected to approach 1 trillion. Thats 1 trillion we cant spend, for instance, on roads, health care or growing the economy. Our debt isnt just big, it is now draining our economic resources. People got this idea that it was just free Dont worry about what your debt is! said Rogoff. Thats the big change thats happened in the world, is a bucket of cold water on this idea that debt doesnt matter. A debt this large, if left unchecked would ultimately obliterate our economy.",Neutral,-1,0.9725622534751892,Reply

They have always been successful with taming inflation, but the economy is not something that can be managed easily. It has momentum and many factors that influence it that are hard to balance.

Of course, maybe you can convince yourself that the level of research and analysis youve done for each company is sufficient. But I think thatd be a tad bit naive. The amount of analysis is always going to be infinite, and unless you have your own bulletproof definition of what constitutes a good company, Id argue that you may as well just buy more index funds and save yourself the hours of research. Also a more general hot take...how do you know what strong management looks like? Or what a dominant market position looks like? Genuine question, because I am not fully convinced that those are meaningful metrics, although I may be wrong.

It sounds like the opportunity is in finding customers with better credit than the borrowers FICO score would have suggested and capturing that arb. But to capture the arb you have to hold the loan. If you sell the loan to capture the arb, you need to convince someone else to buy it at a premium to the value it would have being measured by the FICO score. Now banks could be buying upstart loans on a premium, but that seems unlikely.",Positive,1,0.7369840741157532,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-14,"I appreciate the insight! I understand that UPST believes they have a more accurate model not too shocking of a take, that seems very plausible. What I find surprising is that lenders are choosing to pay a premium over FICO for UPST loans. For context, I work for a big bank in debt trading. When evaluating a product purchased from a company like UPST you will have the names related to the debt and therefore the FICO of the product, alternatively if it is sizable enough youll have a third party evaluate it. It is not like the FICO is unknown, we would check that step 1. UPST would have to convince the lender to pay a premium to buy UPST loans over another source. That is really abnormal, not impossible, but extremely unlikely. Have you heard of lenders paying a premium for UPST loans? It should be noted that even if they cannot capture the arb they expect, UPST can still be successful. Other people in the comments mentioned the speed and ease of getting a loan. That is an effective niche in the retail personal loan origination space that feeds the secondary market. That alone could keep a company successful. I was just surprised to hear they dont keep many of the loans they originate, since that is the only way you capture the full benefit of a superior risk model.",Neutral,0,0.8474635481834412,Reply
