The company I work for used to own Talen energy mentioned in this article the reason it was sold off is because it was just dead weight back then. Perfect example...at the Susquehanna plant mentioned, we had to keep two fleets of excavators on hand in case of a meltdown and pay for upkeep, maintenance, etc... It was literally redundancy for a black swan event, wild. This is the reason that Exelon has basically been the name in the game in nuke generation in the US. My old boss used to head up exelons nuke operations the only way they were able to make it profitable was through acquisition and absolutely ruthless standardization...they acquired a new plant and would implement the playbook...execsemployees who pushed back were gone. Same service intervals, same vendors for IT systems, same schemes, same excavator, same everything across the entire fleet. My company, as many others have long said nuke is the answer...with reasonable regulation. SMR and the involvement of big tech is bringing that conversation to the forefront. Nuke and nuke adjacent industries like utilities are great play at the moment. Same with NG, but thats a whole other discussion."

On top of that, the fact is the more you engage in a risky activity the greater the odds of something bad happening from said activity even if the odds are really really low. i.e. the average driver could correctly boast having a 100 safety record, but obviously youd rightly laugh in their face if they insisted that means theres zero chance that theyll ever get into a car accident. Even if you have a bunch of very safe drivers on the road, the more very safe drivers you have on the road the greater the odds that one of those very safe drivers will get into an accident, it happens every day because theres millions of them on the road. That above paragraph isnt fear mongering about nuclear energy, its statistical odds."

I think he was looking at the Board of OKLO at the time and hearing rumblings of these small reactors to power AI data centers and thought it could be a good play. There was definitely luck involved in the 40 pop in a day, but I think he was looking at it as a play for the ancillary businesses to AI, like selling the pick axes and shovels.

I mean, hitting the shutdown reactor button is what caused the Chernobyl reactors to explode! Same goes to Fukushima with its backup generator design and way too tiny tsunami seawalls. Its not just the Wests operational practices that have made nuclear energy so safe here. Its that reactor facilities have been designed with passive safety in mind to prevent operator error from ever causing a disaster, and the next generation nuclear technology takes that to another level. Its like saying cars in the 50s were so dangerous because even minor accidents could kill or cause severe injury, so people just shouldnt drive. Sure, operators need to improve, but the cars themselves could get a whole lot safer, and they have!"

Looking at your phone or reaching for something will trigger the nag, but its getting better on tracking driver awareness. I still saw some issues with regressions on managing staying in the lane on mountain curves with this update, but most things are far improved. That was a big regression the couple times it happened. I have FSD HW3 which is nearing end of life, but Tesla will be capable of far more advanced computations with HW5 for the robotaxi. While I know my car will never be driverless, Tesla is clawing closer and closer to getting ready for driverless robotaxis. Thats now the direction they are prioritizing over expanding manufacturing facilities. !remindme in 2years, I think they will have robotaxis beginning operations by then, and that will be able to scale up massively."

The point clouds created by Lidar data are precise measures, capable of operating at any level of light, and arent hampered by various sources of noise in the surroundings which can cause problems with cameras, such as lights and the like. Further, stereoscopic measurement is essentially inference IE, not a direct measure of distance or timing, but rather on an inferred model based on parallax and relationships. Lidar will always be more accurate than a camera for the simple fact that Lidar is basically a direct measurement, whereas cameras for such cases are an indirect method. You can get fairly accurate with optical cameras, but never nearly so was with Lidar. Stereoscopic and orthological mapping using cameras is processor heavy far moreso than Lidar point clouds, requires more time for data processing, requires actual light to be present, and can get confused by stray light sources. While both have limitations, particularly in rainy or foggy conditions, these limitations are generally the same. The fundamental issue with cameras for FSD isnt one of data, its one of actual technological and physical limitations which are essentially impossible to overcome."

Drivers arent the only cost to a taxi business and do a lot of stuff you take for granted cleaning, arranging servicing and off duty storage etc. Self driving taxis remove the driver cost but then add in a whole bunch of extra costs cleaners, fleet managers etc plus the rather sizable costs of the extra hardware plus software and dev costs. If its viable at all it would only be at huge scale with immense capital costs. With the inevitable low margins its hard to see who that business would appeal to. The benefit to the customer is also marginal. Is your driverless taxi offering your a significantly better service or outcome than a drivered one? No. They both get you to where you want to go for a small amount of money. Thats it. And for cities they will simply make congestion even worse. America doesnt want to hear this but the solution for moving large numbers of people around quickly and cheaply is more public transport and fewer cars of any kind."

Its a bit more apt to say that cameras dont have any particular advantage over Lidar at all aside from cost, and Lidar is a more reliable system overall with fewer fail points to be concerned with. It has some similar limitations in terms of fog and the like, but the biggest difference is that Lidar gives actual distances well, they give actual time between shooting the laser out and reading it, which is innturn calculated to a distance whereas cameras infer distances you have multiple overlapping images that create a 3D model that you can measure in."

Ive done the math, and I dont see how it can become cheap enough to be cheaper than just owning a car for the average driver, considering that the average American drives like 10,000 miles or more every year. IMO everyone is looking at the wrong sector for self driving vehicles. Taxis are never going to replace car ownership like some who live in an urban bubble insist, car ownership is way too big of a part of our culture. IMO theres far more lucrative uses for a self driving vehicle that will only be possible once they can safely drive anywhere in the US instead of a few geofenced big city areas, including Replacing truck drivers with self driving vehicles. This alone would probably be at least a 100 billion dollar industry. Combine self driving vehicles with drones to replace delivery vans. Last mile delivery is insanely expensive, self driving vehicles and drones could cut this cost down a lot I imagine. Consumer owned self driving vehicles, sold as a safety andor convenience feature. I cant imagine many people wanting a bunch of strangers to ride in their cars even if it can make them money, but I can definitely imagine people being willing to pay up for their own self driving vehicle that can take them to work while they sleepetc."

This is an energy intensive process that produces a lot of CO2 and doesnt end up being better environmentally when you include all factors than just using gas. Which is why a real clean hydrogen breakthrough is so important. But again, companies have been promising cheap, clean hydrogen for decades, and Toyota and Honda went deep on spending money developing hydrogen car technology in the 1990s because they were sure hydrogen production technology would catch up soon, but so far it has not.

Hopefully use clean energy to make H2 from H2O wind, solar, nuclear , especially when we have excess capacity 2.

Its the smallest element and will leak out of microscopic holes that water or gas or natural gas are too big. It will crack metal over time because it will get absorbed into many metal structures. Not to mention its a gas, and to use it in any usable amounts you have to compress it under huge pressure . because of this people are working on other methods, like NH3 ammonia basically same concept but also pair the Hydrogen with Nitrogen to make ammonia , that is much easier to storetransport or even carbon what is basically natural gas but efficiency matters , we have to get hydrogen from water uses energy , then get nitrogen pull from the air, takes a lot of energy , then combine the two in a high pressure system again more energy , so while we can do this its just currently not all the efficient and it takes a whole lot of energy to make ammonia or natural gas"

Its a microscopic gas what will leak out of damn near any container its so small , and unlike natural gas or propane or even ammonia it does not compress down to a liquid, what means storing it in any sort of volume is very problematic because you basically have to store it at extreme pressures . Storing gas at such high pressure , any gas is basically a bomb. It does not even have to be flammable for it to be dangerous if it explodes . To power a car it has to be highly compressed to store enough, and if you get in a car accident you dont want a tank of highly compressed gas to also explode and ripe though your car. I am not sure there is a good solution for this, so much so much of the research is trying to combine it with other things like Nitrogenammonia or carbonnatural gas so its easier to store and transport"

A lot of medical devices also use this technology to improve images and remove noise. Natural language processing NLP is another you know how some systems progressively get better search results the more you use it? It uses some type of ML algorithms to learn. Sensor processing is another different one. A lot of our smart watches uses ML technology for algorithm development.

Walmart, Target and Amazon already have been using AI to optimize their ordering and logistics for years. It is not perfect but takes a lot of tasks off of the human who used to do it manually. Self driving cars isnt what you would expect as Amazon had done it with their warehouses. They use a selfdriving robot to move the entire shelf to a human for picking, instead of having humans run around the warehouse for picking. There isnt going to be a big overnight change as people would have imagined but rather slowly replacing humans starting from tasks until it could replace the job entirely. Likely the Internet didnt change how we lived during the dot com rush but fast forward to today, the Internet fundamentally changed how we live. AI would unfold similarly, but faster and greater than the Internet IMO. We just cant predict who is going to win from the AI revolution, just like no one thought a website that sells books in the early Internet age would become one of the largest companies on earth today."

Now as it affects investing theres a lot of money changing hands based on AI promises, so yes there is a bit of a bubble. But I believe there wont be a sudden burst of that bubble....so many companies have made significant investments into their AI infrastructures that theyll be able to pivot into more useful things when the truth about AI capabilities or lack thereof sets in. It wont just be a bunch of money lost, but they will have to redirect their resources. Yes, there are some acquisitions happening today including where I work that wont pan out in the end, so thats money lost but only for the acquirer, the equity owners of the acquired company have converted their equity into cash, which flows back into more investments, more companies, purchases in the economy, etc. So while I do believe theres a bit of overvaluation in the market based on AI hype, I dont think there will be a sudden bubble burst. It will be a slow correction, IMO, and might be marginalized by all of the other factors driving market movements, and therefore not even noticeable. IMO investing to bet against AI wont make you rich. You could make some money, yes, but probably wont be a huge win.

I deal with a lot of these big cloud vendors AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, MongoDB. The first thing they say when you get on a call with them for anything is have you tried our AI product. Like you get on a call with your account manager to talk about something completely unrelated you need help for and they start pitching AI until you shut them down just so you can get to the actual reason for the call. My answer is that none of our customers are clamoring for AI feature in our product or even asking for that matter, so its not a priority. I think the big tech companies will keep investing though.Microsoft started a war when they invested so heavily in Open AI. This is as much about big tech like Google, AWS, etc... protecting their turf as anything else. Its worth it for them to spend billions on Nvidia chips as insurance to protect their businesses just in case AI takes over. And the hype machine is about generating ROI for the massive investments in a technology that clearly isnt ready yet. Based on what Im seeing, were still a long way from achieving what the hypesters are promising. Doesnt mean we wont get there eventually, but its hard to predict stuff thats maybe 5 years out.

The answer The Sony a6400 camera has an electronic viewfinder EVF with a refresh rate of 60 frames per second fps. Further question can you do it on a6300? the answer Yes, the Sony a6300 does offer an option to increase the electronic viewfinder EVF refresh rate. You can choose between two refresh rates 60 fps default 120 fps high To change the EVF refresh rate on the a6300 Go to the Menu. Navigate to the Setup tab. Look for the option labeled FINDER FRAME RATE. You can select either Standard 60 fps or High 120 fps. The higher refresh rate of 120 fps provides a smoother experience, which can be beneficial for tracking fastmoving subjects. However, it may consume more battery power. Now whats the real answer? Taken from the review website The A6400 inherits the same 2.36 million dot OLED electronic viewfinder from the A6300, which features a 120fps high frame rate setting to help track moving subjects more smoothly with virtually no lag. Further communication I think you made a mistake, because A6400 features the same EVF as the a6300 and it seems thier refresh rates can be adjusted both to 120fps. ChatGPT fallows up Youre correct, and I apologize for the confusion. The Sony a6400, like the a6300, does indeed allow you to adjust the electronic viewfinder EVF refresh rate to either 60 fps or 120 fps. To adjust the EVF refresh rate on the a6400 Go to the Menu. Navigate to the Setup tab usually represented by a toolbox icon. Find the Finder Frame Rate option. Select either Standard 60 fps or High 120 fps. The 120 fps setting provides a smoother viewing experience, particularly useful for tracking fastmoving subjects. However, keep in mind that it might lead to increased battery consumption.

And this is after watching an interview with the CEO of Google DeepMind Demis Hassabis In the short term, AI is overhyped because people are saying it will soon be able to do all these amazing things, and Hassabis says the same thing. AI is advancing quite quickly, with the next big thing being AI agents that can complete complex tasks for you, like an assistant. But thats not going to be in the short term, but moreso in the longer term. Im suspecting 45 years, personally. And that will be a big deal in terms of the tasks it can do for you. But we are not there yet. And this is similar to what Hassabis says, where longterm it may be underhyped but personally I think longer term it is just hyped. I think when companies are able to get AI agents to work, it will hit its stride. Want to also mention, that in an interview with Squawk Pod with Andy Jassy, the CEO of amazon he talked about AI, and the investments amazon is making on 3 major macro areas. One of them being for companies wanting to train their own AI models. And another for companies wanting to use existing models developed by other companies and amazon themselves. So, personally. I think we are still in the short term. Companies and developers are still learning about AI and how to make something concrete with it. Things like chatgpt and Gemini are amazingly impressive imo, but companies have not fully crystalized a way to monetize these tools and learn how to actually use them. Im looking longterm, and the companies investing in AI will benefit, assuming they make the right decisions on how to integrate with their business. But it will not be immediate, and it wont be an immediate spike in businesses but a gradual increase."

What I see is a cluster of AI models accomplishing the job. LLM, like chatGPT are wonderful to understand human language. What I see in the future is someone telling chatGPT I wanna make a trading app collecting the past 20 years of data using free tools and find some correlation between price movement based on any individual or group of indicators, market sentiments, commodities, ect. And then make price projection based on those correlations. and get his app working, adapt to his visions and limited technical knowledge needed to make it happens. BUT I dont see chatGPT doing all the understanding, work planification and execution by his own. What I see is ChatGPT understanding the assignment, putting the technical word on top of those simple words, sending function calls to other models gathering the necessary tools, information and structures needed so his application can be made by his own. In this cases, yeah AI will be able to run a company by his own based on human methodologies, human discovery and human morality.

I shudder to think that the current trend is about ignoring the basics of inspection filtering, reference location, pattern matching, test construction, etc. which dont involve AI at all. AI is exciting research, but I think we are witnessing the breakdown in modern venture capitals investment ability to distinguish business problems and solutions. The risky financing behind technology has gotten out of control, and the ability to profit from it has become more about hype for a new technology than about profits or applicability to real world problems. It is a completely circular sales cycle where a technology generates hype, gets funded, and then the VCs are covered through financing offered by float from cloud service providers that see more volume in service consumption. It is all just a dance where we are running compute cycles for no reason except to prop up investment in a tech startup whose primary value is consuming more cloud services. AI is the final cycle of this because it gives you an excuse to consume a ton of resources to train these models, and not have to worry about the business effects of what these models can actually deliver until you are finished. I see a huge bubble coming when companies realize that these models are not competitive, and they wasted a ton of money and investment training them.

When it comes to new tech, companies never wait until its 100 perfectly flawless before they put it in normie hands. This is because the data from your experience services development in a way that a lab environment cannot. I can compare it to a couple of different things. 1 Video game developers doing public betas for releases and consequential updates. There is basically an open admission from every type of software developer that they need widespread public usage data and feedback in order to effectively develop, and this is the most obvious, consumerunderstabdable example. Githubs baseline operating methodology is along the same lines. The thinking is that once they have a ton of anecdotal scenarios like yours, they can then fix the problems youre pointing out effectively, in a targeted manner. It is very difficult to anticipate your situation and develop against the possibility of that outcome in a lab setting without a time machine to work with. In video games case, theyre often assessing pixeltopixel interactions, so bots cant possibly give them the same data humans can. Does that mean theyre putting out an unfinished product at first? Sure, technically you could describe it that way. But its normal. 2 Chip readers at stores. Do you remember when the collective powers that be moved us from swiping to inserting, and later from inserting to tapping? Something no one feels the need to talk about is the fact that the newest method was always jank as hell for the first couple years of existing. There was a solid year of my life where 3 failed inserts followed by a swipe was my normal, every visit routine at the grocery store. I had no one to Karen at, and I never asked for this repetitive routine to be added to my life, but there it was, and if I wanted groceries I had to comply. I dont bother tapping yet because inserting once is finally working consistently, so Ill do that until they force me to switch methods again. Thats how all of this technology goes, and its how it will always go. Things will be released with issues so the public can provide the kind of broad feedback loop that simplifies the last chunk of development. Im not an AI investor, but youre using doomspeak to describe something completely normal in the software development world. Its like youre describing all the risky things the sun can do to blind or kill a person, but then taking that all the way to the argument that this is why existing under the sun cant last forever.

Machine learning would come in if the part placement relative to the camera shifts around for whatever reason. For example if you wanted to extract a mask or bounding box of the part as a preprocessing step. You can even use a model like Florence to generate embeddings and measure the distribution of the embeddings from data coming off the assembly line.

I dont think AI is overhyped. Actually, I think people largely dont appreciate its full potential. However, it could still be another decade or two before we fully reach that point. When we do, however, the world will be a very different place. It will be at least as large of a leap as the internet ushered in. If youre too young to remember needing to consult an encyclopedia or filling out an order form to mail away for something you may not fully appreciate the extent to which our lives have changed postinternet and you may not realize that it all started with a 2400bps dialup connection to ASCII message boards. Thats about where AI is right now somewhere between proof of concept and marginally useful in certain applications. 20 years ago the idea that a computer would be able to recognize a random image of a cat was virtually unthinkable. Now it can not only identify a cat it can nearly instantly generate an new image of an American Wirehair holding a sparkler while flying over Mt. Fuji in a wingsuit. My programming IDE autogenerates about 25 of my code out of thin air with zero effort on my part. These are HUGE leaps, and theyve occurred very quickly. The problem with AI is really just consistency. Something that fails 510 of the time isnt particularly useful in most cases even if the results most of the time are mindblowing. But that error rate will improve with additional training. More importantly, however, is that the learning algorithms are still being refined. Very soon we may be able to reduce the required training data sets by several orders of magnitude, for example. In the short term the AI bubble may or may not burst the way the dotcom bubble did. But, long term, I expect it to be a fundamental force in virtually all aspects of modern life just as the internet has now become."

I was a computer programmer for about 15 or so years. I went through the.com bubble and was born before the Internet. AI has been pushed and trumpeted for decades. And its never been there. Its just been a lot of hot air. They finally have hardware that could implement this stuff and that was always the bottleneck. Theyve had the AI languages forever. You couldve done this stuff 30 years ago , its just that youd be running on Windows 95. AI is simply the next step in programming. Its such a nobrainer. Its everything weve ever been doing in coding a step further. Like going to objectoriented programming. That was a nobrainer. From linear topdown programming. The savings in coding and efficiency was massive and no one could predict all the things we would be able to do with reuseable code. Code with hundreds of developers working on their isolated parts. The gaming industry, which is ginormous, would be a speck of a shadow of what it is now if we stayed with old programming languages and models. I am by no means an AI expert. But I know when technology is ripe. And it is imperative we go this direction. But youre correct in that monetizing it is a whole other matter. And thats not up to technology thats up to business people. Its like weve invented the wheel. If people just use them to make frisbees, its not going to be any big change. The me existence of the wheel does not buy itself create a engineering revolution. you need people who come up with ideas that can be leveraged and implemented using the wheel. And thats one of the disconnects I keep seeing people ignore. The technology is no joke. It is a nobrainer. We will go this way and 10 years from now youre going to be laughing at yourself for ever questioning it. Its just gonna be everywhere. But making a widget that sells a billion copies is a whole other set of skills. Its a vastly different set of skills. And we need those people to come forward and start making their widgets."

Can I beat a tuned model with a powerful RAG building the context window? Maybe. But at worst it is very comparable, and Im a lot smarter than most people.

But my point was that while hardware will definitely improveand with improved hardware we may also see opportunities for improving softwareas you said, were reaching the asymptotic limit of what we can do with language and with a language model that essentially operates as a next word or next phrase predictor. And until we figure out a better theory of mind, what we got now is more or less it. That is, were going to have to shovel in more and more stuff in there for very small incremental improvements in intelligence. Its an amazing tool, and I do agree with you that it does have the power to transform our economyonce folks figure out the right ways to apply these tools. For me, I use it as a means to get some crossdisciplinary insight, which is fascinating. But as I noted before in my downvoted remarks LLMs are starting to reach an asymptote where the improvements are slowing down and becoming more incremental rather than fundamental. ... And it will require a fundamental rethinking of how AI works to move past where we are now. For example, Id love it if someone working on CoPilot would consider somehow marrying it with a toolset that can do dataflow analysis, semantic flow analysis and a method for onmachine code analysis such as variable usage as part of the underlying model. Meaning Id love it if CoPilot would not make stupid errors, like suggesting code that calls routines that are misnamed or that are guessed at, or calling out using variables that do not exist or are named differently."

                    "text": "Oh, I have no doubt GPUs will improve, and Im sure well see neurochips and other technologies roll out which make it possible to run large model LLMs on ever smaller and less energyintensive platforms. I personally would like to see the day when we can roll out a smallscale LLM that runs on a Teddy Ruxpinlike toy that can run enough of an LLM to hold sophisticated conversations with small children that can run off two Ccells. But from a software perspective the improvements were seeing in LLMs seem to be less fundamental and more incremental. In part, were simply hitting the limits of the philosophical theories of language and intelligenceor rather, the presumption that intelligence is strictly a linguistic construct rather than is based on an understanding of the world that is deeper than the symbols we attach to that meaning. Or, framed another way, LLMs currently do not have a model of the world or a model of how the world works essentially they predict the next word or collection of words that would go in a sentence as a response to an input collection of words. Its why there are so many examples of LLMs getting basic math wrong, or why we see things like CoPilot write shitty software because there is no understanding there. Just the manipulation of symbols. And the people currently working on the next generation of LLMs are essentially operating on the theory that if we could just shovel more shit in there, well get smarter LLMs. My own theory is that until we have a better theory of mind than the ideas from philosophical linguists, were only going to see very minor incremental improvements in what is already out there. Sure, itll be less energy intensive and eventually we may even see it run locally on portable devices. But it wont be smarter. And we already know that the way the human mind processes information is not just linguistic in nature. For example, at my alma mater, work was done to identify the clusters of neurons in the human brain that drive our ability to recognize faces. That is, you dont learn how to recognize faces after youre born from some sort of tabula rasa instead, there is builtin hardware inside the human brain which handles this recognition, and that there is a finite number of these clusters may go towards explaining why Dunbars number seems to exist."

Or, more specifically, my interest in Artificial Intelligence came about in the early 1980s when I was in college and read the works of John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon. The second programming language I ever learned after BASIC on a TRS80 was LISP and my high school science fair project was building a primitive theorem prover which could solve basic problems in propositional calculus. Which, at the time, was considered Artificial Intelligence, but now is just a fascinating parlor trick done by nerds with too much time on our hands. Edit to add for those interested, the works I used to help me with my science fair projects were Patric Winstons Artificial Intelligence first edition and J.A. Robinsons Logic Form and Function."

Is the quality of life getting worse, of course not, like the rest of the world we take advantage of technology innovation and efficiency, but the US is no longer the best place to live for an average citizen. Were just not superior to the other top counties, as we used to be. Given the enormous size of our economy we should be. The examples of corporate welfare are plentiful. The biggest is healthcare. Consider that the biggest government expense is healthcare Medicare, Medicaid, VA, active service, ACA, employees, contractors employees, etc. The US federal government is the biggest buyer of healthcare in the world, but pays more per unit person, drug, etc than any other government. These prices could be negotiated down, but industry influence prevents that. FYI the Medicare drug negotiation that is much talked about today is a deception. The three drugs I checked all go off patent in 2026, the year the negotiated price comes into effect. In effect not costing big pharma anything. Eliquis, a drug used by someone I know, is more expensive in the US, the largest customer of it, than in any other country. The primary goals of ACA were two fold, lower prices and cover more people. More people are covered, but US prices continue to run wild. KFF, Kaiser Family Foundation has great studies of healthcare costs and effectively across the world. The US spends 34 times more for healthcare than the average of other developedrich nations. Other examples of government overpaying include military and even the broadband subsidies. The US pays 4 times more per fighter jet and Russia or China. It might be a better jet, but not so much better that one is more effective than three of theirs. The US has among the highest broadband Internet costs in the world. Too many poor and rural people cant afford the high cost. Rather than fostering competition to provide people options and keep prices down, the federal government just pays the overpriced broadband services from cable companies. This form of corporate welfare, overpaying, is not generally discussed, but it is bankrupting the US federal government and many citizens, and its making US based business operations and citizens less competitive in the global market. Know that this is not due to politicians not wanting to help constituents. This is due to the high likelihood that if they try to lower the ridiculously high prices Americans pay, theyll be fought with many millions of dollars the industry will spend in ads against them, funds to their opponents, etc. Its not the politicians that are the problem, its the system theyre in. And thats why changing the politicians changes little in real life. The real change is media. They make money off the big Republican vs Democrat distraction. And they make a ton of money running ads for the corporations who love that Americans government pay multiples more than other rich people whose governments they cant do readily manipulate. Can you imagine any of them reporting that their advertisers are screwing Americans with the by far the highest prices in the world? All the people, citizens, business leaders, politicians, etc are doing the best they can within the system we have. If you want a system thats great for corporations in spite of their whining for more more more youve got it in the US, just look at the US stock markets and corporate profitability. But if you want a system great for citizens and US based business operations, well the US needs some major reforms."

I am not sure how better to explain that the system is broken not the people not the politicians, not the business people and not Americans. For specifics look at the ACA vote. It passed, but got just about none of the savings initially proposed. Did all voting for it conspire to screw their constituents? No. Did those opposed screw their constituents? No. Did some poeple get insurance who didnt before? Yes. Did the healthcare companies make out like bandits. Yes.

The voice was from the woman who spoke for the health insurance industry group. They voted for it to go on to Congress, and it passed Congress the next day. You choose to believe what you want. So long as there are enough like you, corporations will continue to set profit and market value records, while the US middle class continues to shrink, and the US government gets closer and closer to bankruptcy.
