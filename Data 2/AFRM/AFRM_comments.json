They are making money, but not enough for Wall Street to take notice….Shorts really do love to short Affirm…..Which is why Sezzle being up so much does not make any sense to me, is it that they charge fees and interest as well and Investors see this as a positive for revenue….They are so much smaller than Affirm with very few merchants and customers yet their stock price is over $200 a share, is this some kind of manipulation or hype up of the stock by large investors or is Sezzle the real deal….Can someone explain this to me…..It seems, it’s the amount of shares outstanding which is 5 million vs 267 million with Affirm…..the other thing is the trading volume is extremely low…..So maybe that is the answer…."

It seems Wall Street is believing the Upstart story more than the Affirm story and I think Wall Street has gotten that story wrong.  I feel Affirm has a better future, better management and a better product with a moat than Upstart.  To me Upstart is just another bank that claims to use AI and once you mention AI, Wall Street goes crazy for it....This will change once Affirm provides its quarterly number over the coming 3 weeks.

Day to Day, volatility closely pegged to TNX/FVX rates and yes for example, today’s consumer sentiment .If you compare most credit company sentiment and reporting recently , Max and his algorithms seem to be the most well-informed decision makers when it comes to extending credit to those who need it most , especially vs Discover , CapitalOne etc .Next 3 months outlook -  anticipate further Fed interest rates drop, uptick in holiday spending, of course, pre/post election volatility , Nov-Dec relief /Santa rally . Very curious to see if there’s an iPhone upgrade cycle/AFRM boost as well,  as potential catalyst.Not expecting short squeeze like we had last November/Dec , but, organically better financial results-driven  upward price momentum [and progress towards profitability] is a far better pillar/justification for owning the stock than Hedge fund activity."

A good example is when Joe and Kamala went to Shanksville, PA for the anniversary of 911 and entered the room with the 911 victims family members and the first responders NOT one stood up or clapped.On the other hand when Trump came into the same room afterwards, they all stood up with cheers and clapping for minutes.Look at Trump&#39;s massive rally in blue NY&#39;s Long Island. Over 36 thousand showed up in total inside and outside.The love for Trump is growing and is undeniable. MAGA!"

With all of the major deals Affirm has secured over the past few years which include most of the major retail players, it just boggles the mind as to how this stock is not trading in the $75 range and not the $40 range.   It truly is amazing that the analyst and Hedge Funds believe in PayPal, Pays and a couple of others before they believe that Affirm can make a difference in consumers and merchants lives both Financially and socially.   Yes, Affirm is not profitable, but on that same note they are not a horrible company that is basically borrowing to stay afloat.  Affirm has plenty of cash and its about to become profitable in the next quarter, but I am not sure that it will change much of the sentiment in both Wall Street and social media platform.   It seems Affirm is still stuck with the stigma that the only people that use Affirm are those that are struggling financially with high credit card debt which is simply not the case…..Hopefully Affirms next earnings report shocks and Awes everyone and we can finally start to reach that plateau…..With profitability and a higher GMV as well as higher customer usage…."

Mizuho analysts led by Dan Dolev on Thursday said cuts can take earnings per share beyond consensus forecasts, rating the stock at Outperform with a $65 target.Affirm rose 0.3% in Friday&#39;s premarket to $45.11.Beyond Fed&#39;s actions, Friedman likes Affirm&#39;s new partnerships, like the one with Apple Pay and Amazon, as well as its growing acceptance by merchants."

The company uses algorithms to lend money one transaction at a time, helping borrowers avoid running up a balance. Affirm is so confident that its customers will pay them back that the company doesn&#39;t charge late fees.In June, Apple announced it would end its buy now, pay later product and use Affirm instead. Affirm recently integrated directly into Apple Pay, exposing Affirm to the estimated 153 million iOS users in the United States.As the Apple deal adds to its already-blazing growth, Affirm should grow leaps and bounds over the next five years. The stock is down 77% from its 2021 highs, but it&#39;s hard to see that lasting; the company recently turned its first operating profit and should make strides toward bottom-line profitability over the coming years.Stellar growth and improving financials could force Wall Street to view the stock in a new light, making Affirm a rising star with big-time investment potential."

Well well, one year later and Apple stopped their BNPL service and gave it to Affirm to manage, and guess what you will see a Huge uptick from here…..I am now saying that Affirm stock will surpass $175 a share before the end of 2025…..Get on the bandwagon and enjoy a nice uptick for this stock…..Daniel I am waiting for your response……How come you pump this stock so much?….there I beat you to it…..LOL!!"

This will be an interesting time for Affirm with all of the deals coming to fruition at the same time as well as the options that were awarded dropping from the reports as well.  The Zacks report stated that the stock price should see over $175 a share over the next 18 months or so.  Let&#39;s hope they are correct in their assumption and we see $200 a share over the next 18 months......Good Luck to all longs!!"

So, an AFRM investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects AFRM the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for AFRM. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

He is asking that all internal emails be revealed and scrutinized by investigators.Also, supposably, there&#39;s been an ABC leaker, saying dingdong Kamala was given the questions before the debate. Stay tuned and this one.Needless to say, the debate polling numbers shows little to no movement for either candidate after debate. BUT, all the post-debate polling suggests Trump won this debate and quite decisively — independents and undecided voters heavily swung in Trump’s corner, by significant numbers.ABC - Kamala, are Americans better off today than they were four (4) years ago? - Well let me tell you, I grew up in a middle class family and my mother saved hard to be able to buy our first home. Oh! In a neighborhood where everyone is proud to kept their lawns so nice, buh buh buh.Then you have her sit down solo interview just two (2) days ago, where she gave the same lame non-answer about Americans being better off, along with more gibberish of rainbows and unicorns for Americans.She NOT capable of running an ice cream stand let alone this country that Biden and dingdong have taken down into the dumpster. Makes me sick to my stomach."

SECOND, I think the consumer needs some kind of structure to be able to borrow responsibly, which credit cards do not give you. As you know most consumers will spend as much as they can and then worry about paying the money back later, with a 4 payment plan they know when the last payment is. THIRD, it gives merchants a better options than credit cards with a lower fee as well as an options for Merchants to sell more product to a more responsible consumer. FOURTH, both the Merchant and Affirm end up with way less delinquent accounts than with credit cards because of Affirm’s proprietary AI system does a diligent, but soft credit check. FIFTH, the system is very transparent as to the when your payments end and what your interest rate is. I feel that those 5 responses should be enough to satisfy many negative mind and post…..LOL!!"

Affirm paid pays off $800 million of debt and is still consider in the same category as Upstart.  This is the problem with the Algorithms being used and putting both firms under the same category although they are both tech-finance firms, they are both completely different.  Upstart does student, car, mortgage and consolidation loans while Affirm does the BNPL and their active debit/credit card.  Affirm does not do any car, mortgage or consolidation loans.  What a mess with Upstart and their issuance….LOL.  Do not worry about a bit of a pullback like I said before, this too shall pass and we will be heading higher for longer."

Those that are here stating to sell, that this is not worth anything and will collapse eventually do not really understand the role of the consumer in the USA and across the world.  In the USA 66% of our economy is controlled and supported by the consumer which many are reluctant to view the benefits when it comes to this company Affirm and how this will enrich the company.   Yes, currently every analyst to CEO is stating the consumer is struggling with credit card debt, slowing spending and trying to figure out a budget.  But in the end Affirm reported great numbers while Visa and Mastercard reported horrible numbers.  These two different reports should show/emphasis where the new users/customers are coming from.  Yet the markets punishes this company because basically two reasons, one, no one feels this company will make it or have a place in todays credit card economy of course that is wrong just proven by Affirms improving numbers (smaller loses).  two, the banks are currently trying to force Affirm to fail because Affirm continues to take market share away from them…..Many may laugh at his, but it is true and this is proven by my first reason.  Shorts and traders enjoy this stock now, because when it becomes profitable and pays off their debt, this will be a rocket upwards….."

For those that have not bought I suggest you stay on the sideline for the next two months and see what happens….I would not suggest buying here with September being such a bad months for stocks which the algorithms has already been program to sell at any negative news….."

Buy as much as you can and ride it up to the $100 level by year-end. Do not listen to the Naysayers on this board and know what you own.  This will be a $300 stock within 3 years and if we are lucky will surpassed that to $500 a share price with the new Apple deal.  Have a great short week longs and continue to hold and add to your position.  At this level this is a bargain!!"

AFRM will likely trade on near-term consumer sentiment expectations and estimate revisions and AFRM is executing well, but the blue-sky long-term valuation frameworks yield little to no upside from current trading levels, skewing risk-reward to the downside, hence our UW."

Profitability will be achieve in the coming quarter, which took Amazon 12 years to achieve and Affirm basically has done it in 4 years if all comes to fruition.  Prior to 3.5 years ago you could not invest in Affirm since it was not a public company so that is not correct.  Two, no one is asking you to own the stock, so you can move along.  But personally this stock will be extremely profitable and has already started to affect the profitability of both Visa and Mastercard via what the reported earlier this quarter, they were down 11 and 12 percent respectably.  How long have you been investing?  It seems you are rather young at this game and do not understand that most public companies struggle for the first 3-5-7 years….One of the few companies that achieved profitability was CAVA and it was profitable 1 year after its IPO."

Management expects sales for the period to come in between $640 million and $670 million, far ahead of the average analyst estimate&#39;s call for sales of $625 million. The company also said it expected its adjusted operating income margin to be between 14% and 16% in the quarter. It looks like margins should improve as the year progresses.For the full year, Affirm is guiding for an adjusted operating margin of 18.4% -- and it expects to shift into profitability in fiscal Q4. The company also guided for annual GMV of more than $33.5 billion, topping Wall Street&#39;s expectations. Even better, the company said that revenue as a percentage of GMV will be at least 10 basis points higher than in the last fiscal year. With the company guiding for a roughly 26% annual increase for GMV and indicating that take rates will improve slightly, revenue growth should come in above that level based on management&#39;s targets."

Pretty impressive.At the end of June, we had $2.1 billion in total liquidity split between cash and securities available for sale, similar to our total liquidity at both the end of March as well as the end of the prior fiscal year. Against this amount, we had $1.3 billion in convertible debt. As previously announced, in December 2023 the Affirm board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible debt during calendar year 2024. As of June 30, 2024, we repurchased $77 million in face value of our convertible debt for approximately $64 million in cash, resulting in a gain on repurchase of approximately $13 million under this authorization. Subsequent to quarter end through August 23, 2024, we repurchased an additional $141 million in face value of our convertible debt for approximately $120 million in cash, resulting in a gain on repurchase of approximately $20 million. Following these repurchases, as of August 23, 2024, approximately $1.2 billion of the convertible debt remains outstanding and the December repurchase authorization has $582 million in remaining capacity. Subject to market conditions, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize the debt capital structure and proactively manage long-term liabilities."

As our FY’23 ended, we were proud to report that we achieved this goal. Adjusted operating income in FQ4’23 was just $15 million, but it had a plus sign in front of it! One year later – now – our adjusted operating income is $381 million for the full FY’24, $150 million of it earned in the fourth fiscal quarter – thanks to continued product improvements, merchant growth, attentive risk management, and excellent capital execution. It is therefore only appropriate that we set another public goal today: we intend and expect to be profitable on a GAAP basis in our fourth fiscal quarter, and plan to operate the business while maintaining GAAP profitability thereafter."

The economy is still strong and so are the consumers, but it seems there is something odd happening with the stock price, although the company is not profitable as Amazon was for all those years because of reinvestment. It seems that powers that be do not want Affirm to be successful, because it will bite into their own earnings and of course we have already seen it with Visa and Mastercard reporting lower than expected earnings. Like I said in the past, Jaime Diamond stated in 2023 that his biggest competitor is Affirm.  Hence they are putting all fo their lobbyist to work on their side….Maybe one of those two behemoths will offer Affirm a buyout…..LOL!!!"

I really like the CEO Max Levchin (he co-founded PayPal along with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel). Despite what some of the old farts on here think, I’m not trying to “pump” my own stock. I just choose to open source my research for anyone that’s interested:\n\n1. Affirm is expanding beyond just &#34;Buy Now Pay Later&#34; into becoming an alternative payment network, competing with major players like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal.\n\n2. The introduction of the Affirm Card significantly expands their total addressable market (TAM) from $1 trillion (U.S. e-commerce only) to $7 trillion (total U.S. retail). International expansion would be incremental to this.\n\n3. The uncertainty surrounding consumer credit makes this a higher risk investment but the entry price, I believe, already discounts a lot of that uncertainty. Risks are mitigated through the company’s robust underwriting practices, diverse funding channels, and key partnerships with Apple, Walmart and Amazon.\n\n4. Affirm is entering the B2B BNPL space which is an untapped market and potentially, a significant growth driver that isn’t yet priced into the stock."

Now the dems way of pandering money to foreign entities has dried up and now you’re going to see a dump of an economy like you’ve never seen before unless Biden invests in America and his own citizens and allow capitalism and capital markets to flow through deregulation etc. Like I said now we are at the crossroads where Main Street and Wall Street are going to pay big time for the failures of this administration and its lack of interest in allowing entities in particular energy companies to be a source of investment so that every citizen can benefit economically."
