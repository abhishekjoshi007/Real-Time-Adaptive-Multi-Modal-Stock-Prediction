Yahoo,2024-10-30,"AFRM has a strong presence in the fintech space, which is growing rapidly, particularly in the mobile payments and digital transactions segments, providing Affirm with long term growth opportunities. The growth of the mobile payments market offers significant opportunities for AFRM as consumers turn to digital payments. By capitalizing on this trend, AFRM can strengthen its position in the market and achieve long term growth. Despite AFRM&#39;s current financial challenges, its strategic positioning in the fast growing fintech sector and positive ratings in the market indicate its growth potential. The company&#39;s initiatives to modernize its products and services and move into higher income customer segments could be key to moving toward increased profitability and a stronger market position.

Yahoo,2024-10-11,Analysts finally catching up to the Affirm/Apple Pay agreement. They’re also finally figuring out that Max built a better mousetrap. BNPL will be the new norm for credit and Affirm is the best of the best which is why every e-commerce company on the planet is so eager to team up with Affirm and their proprietary technology that has revolutionized underwriting. Combine that with the fact Affirm issues short term loans and doesn’t give  long term lines of credit and you see why traditional banks are dealing with high delinquency rates and Affirm isn’t.

Yahoo,2024-09-24,"Agree with many of the comments here both  how manipulated this stock is by the market makers and hedge funds who serve the interests of the AFRM-threatened traditional banks/Credit companies .My outlook for the stock next 3-9 months is generally positive - empirically, some drivers: Interest rates going down, short % is near all time low, and technically the first Golden Cross [50 EMA/200MA] in a very long time.  Also look at recent VWAP, and more importantly, AVWAP’s from key levels. Day to Day, volatility closely pegged to TNX/FVX rates and yes for example, today’s consumer sentiment .If you compare most credit company sentiment and reporting recently , Max and his algorithms seem to be the most well-informed decision makers when it comes to extending credit to those who need it most , especially vs Discover , CapitalOne etc .Next 3 months outlook -  anticipate further Fed interest rates drop, uptick in holiday spending, of course, pre/post election volatility , Nov-Dec relief /Santa rally . Very curious to see if there’s an iPhone upgrade cycle/AFRM boost as well,  as potential catalyst.Not expecting short squeeze like we had last November/Dec , but, organically better financial results-driven  upward price momentum [and progress towards profitability] is a far better pillar/justification for owning the stock than Hedge fund activity.",Positive,1,0.9999997615814209,Main

With all of the major deals Affirm has secured over the past few years which include most of the major retail players, it just boggles the mind as to how this stock is not trading in the $75 range and not the $40 range.

Yes, Affirm is not profitable, but on that same note they are not a horrible company that is basically borrowing to stay afloat.  Affirm has plenty of cash and its about to become profitable in the next quarter, but I am not sure that it will change much of the sentiment in both Wall Street and social media platform.

Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for AFRM. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her.

BUT, all the post-debate polling suggests Trump won this debate and quite decisively — independents and undecided voters heavily swung in Trump’s corner, by significant numbers.ABC - Kamala, are Americans better off today than they were four (4) years ago? - Well let me tell you, I grew up in a middle class family and my mother saved hard to be able to buy our first home. Oh! In a neighborhood where everyone is proud to kept their lawns so nice, buh buh buh.Then you have her sit down solo interview just two (2) days ago, where she gave the same lame non-answer about Americans being better off, along with more gibberish of rainbows and unicorns for Americans.She NOT capable of running an ice cream stand let alone this country that Biden and dingdong have taken down into the dumpster.

Yahoo,2024-09-16,"Why I consider this to be a great investment for both the consumer and the investor:FIRST, I believe this is a better alternative to credit cards, it gives you better interest rate options as well as better payment options. SECOND, I think the consumer needs some kind of structure to be able to borrow responsibly, which credit cards do not give you. As you know most consumers will spend as much as they can and then worry about paying the money back later, with a 4 payment plan they know when the last payment is. THIRD, it gives merchants a better options than credit cards with a lower fee as well as an options for Merchants to sell more product to a more responsible consumer. FOURTH, both the Merchant and Affirm end up with way less delinquent accounts than with credit cards because of Affirm’s proprietary AI system does a diligent, but soft credit check. FIFTH, the system is very transparent as to the when your payments end and what your interest rate is. I feel that those 5 responses should be enough to satisfy many negative mind and post…..LOL!!",Positive,1,0.9999935626983643,Main

Yes, currently every analyst to CEO is stating the consumer is struggling with credit card debt, slowing spending and trying to figure out a budget.  But in the end Affirm reported great numbers while Visa and Mastercard reported horrible numbers.  These two different reports should show/emphasis where the new users/customers are coming from.  Yet the markets punishes this company because basically two reasons, one, no one feels this company will make it or have a place in todays credit card economy of course that is wrong just proven by Affirms improving numbers (smaller loses).  two, the banks are currently trying to force Affirm to fail because Affirm continues to take market share away from them…..Many may laugh at his, but it is true and this is proven by my first reason.

The main reason why it is dropping of course has to do with the bad jobs report and the Algorithms making an assumption that people will default on their loans over the coming months.

Pretty impressive.At the end of June, we had $2.1 billion in total liquidity split between cash and securities available for sale, similar to our total liquidity at both the end of March as well as the end of the prior fiscal year. Against this amount, we had $1.3 billion in convertible debt. As previously announced, in December 2023 the Affirm board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible debt during calendar year 2024. As of June 30, 2024, we repurchased $77 million in face value of our convertible debt for approximately $64 million in cash, resulting in a gain on repurchase of approximately $13 million under this authorization. Subsequent to quarter end through August 23, 2024, we repurchased an additional $141 million in face value of our convertible debt for approximately $120 million in cash, resulting in a gain on repurchase of approximately $20 million. Following these repurchases, as of August 23, 2024, approximately $1.2 billion of the convertible debt remains outstanding and the December repurchase authorization has $582 million in remaining capacity.

Yahoo,2024-08-28,Yahoo is horrible with their quotes. The ask is currently $36.97 in AH trading!Affirm is knocking on the door of profitability as well as the warrants roll off the balance sheet.

Think about that for a minute and those so called catastrophic delinquencies that the shorts were screaming about. Revenue also increased to $659 million while analysts expected $625 million.

I really like the CEO Max Levchin (he co-founded PayPal along with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel). Despite what some of the old farts on here think, I’m not trying to “pump” my own stock. I just choose to open source my research for anyone that’s interested:

1. Affirm is expanding beyond just &#34;Buy Now Pay Later&#34; into becoming an alternative payment network, competing with major players like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal.

2. The introduction of the Affirm Card significantly expands their total addressable market (TAM) from $1 trillion (U.S. e-commerce only) to $7 trillion (total U.S. retail). International expansion would be incremental to this.

3. The uncertainty surrounding consumer credit makes this a higher risk investment but the entry price, I believe, already discounts a lot of that uncertainty. Risks are mitigated through the company’s robust underwriting practices, diverse funding channels, and key partnerships with Apple, Walmart and Amazon.

4. Affirm is entering the B2B BNPL space which is an untapped market and potentially, a significant growth driver that isn’t yet priced into the stock.",Positive,1,0.9851018190383911,Main
