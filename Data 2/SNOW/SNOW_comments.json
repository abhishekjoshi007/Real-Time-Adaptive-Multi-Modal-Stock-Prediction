If youre not beating the SP then youre losing. Bear in mind that while youre sitting on cash waiting for the next piece of bad news, that money isnt appreciating like it would with a set it and forget it approach. Also every time one of your picks starts to plateau and you decide to sell you have to give the tax man his cut which means you have less to reinvest. If you have to sell before youve owned the stock for a year then youll have to pay capital gains which will cut into your profit even more. All these things plus the fact that there isnt a guarantee that a stock will bounce back from bad news means that this is probably not the slam dunk you think it is. You may get lucky a few times but its probably not a sustainable investing strategy."

Being profitable in automotive means being able to churn out volume. But theyre getting g there with Amazon, USPS and FedEx fleet contracts. Their trucks are just so nice to drive. They feel so premium in every way, and pretty much every Rivian owner Ive encountered loves their truck! They push out new features all the time, and those features actually seem to work. The R2 is coming out next year and the R3R3X the year after. This is where theyll gain a lot of market share, because they are affordable. People think EVs are going away, but how many KIAs Model 3s, and Model Ys do you see on a daily basis? Millions! And once people start installing home chargers, their gasmaintenance costs will fall dramatically. Of the EV stocks, I think RIVN has the best story. Lucid might have the best car, but Rivian especially with VW investment has a lot of upside, IMO"

The downside is their very small scale and lack of profitability. They didnt expand their production that much this year and steep ongoing losses forced them to mothball their planned new factory in some emergency cost cutting. Those losses also did cast some doubt on their runway and viability to continue. BUT theres counterpoint good news for all of that. One, theyve now been backstopped by a 5 billion ? commitment from VW, so the worries of cash starvation, dilution and bankruptcy are off the table for several years, assuming VW honors the agreement. The modest production numbers do at least reflect accurate and realistic forecasting, and the credibility of the CEO. Many even bet theyd never get to production at all, then doubted how many units. Hes delivered on his promises all along the way, which no other EV company seems to do. Rivian vehicles are expensive, and the headline numbers suggest that they need high margins but that means keeping prices high. The upside is their low production numbers mean at their scale they only need to attract affluent buyers anyway. But if they ever scale up, theyll have to solve the margin puzzle and so far it doesnt seem like they can do both. Maybe with VW being more actively invovled?"

In reality, while Snowflake works, it doesnt have anything close to the extended capabilities of the big3 mature cloud platforms AWS, GCP Azure and the difficulty remains in orchestrating useful data usecases. Simultaneously, the hyperscalers have continued to develop and push their own competing platforms why would i leave my full GCP stack to do random oneoff work on Snowflake that I could do on BigQuery? Or Redshift, or SynapseFabric? And then at least I have a mature AI platform next to my data Snowpark is an absolute joke. Not to mention that Databricks has done a much better job of winning over developers than Snowflake has, and Databricks integrates better with existing cloud providers.

I wont even get into public chargers and how common they arent, because that part is largely irrelevant and could be rectified faster than the other issues. General example from my own life, I considered going EV on my last upgrade. My reality was that I was going to have to park at my local police station for over an hour once per week, and it would be a 20 minute walk back and forth to my apartment if I didnt want to sit in the parking lot that whole time. Convincing my landlord to install a charger at our apartment building has logistical problems because there is nowhere obvious to put one let alone two or three, even if convincing them to do it is a slam dunk it isnt.

The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years. Why do you think it ran up? It still hasnt lost the daily uptrend and it has retained tremendous growth after doubling in value."

Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way."

It comes off the shelf with everything you need and is easy to monitor, straddle and strangle usage and cost. But the savings isnt the _primary_ reason for the valuation free fall 3. SNOW is tanking not so much bc of shifting away comput but but because the valuation was based on machine learning and BI products which would use snowflake compute that never materialized AND guidance was juiced bc they were based on purchased credits NOT credit usage sales reps oversell the fuck outta credits, so much so that most customers will roll over at renewal, purchase less If you think snowflake can figure out and execute on the machine learning product its an excellent long term play precisely because of 1. If you think they cannot then its still probably way overvalued"

I see a lot of people on this forum looking for sinister stock manipulation, trends, and other &#34;tailwinds&#34; that are going to move the stock.  It isn&#39;t that complicated:  The company needs to make money for shareholders.  As long as they continue to spend more than they earn, more and more investors will abandon Snowflake&#39;s path to profitability.  When the guy who started the company BAILS before they ever make a dime in profit- it&#39;s not a good look."

They owned around 130,000 SNOW shares on June 30, then during July-Aug-Sept they added around 630,000 shares, obviously a huge increase in their position.  Those interested in this company should go to the SNOW site and listen to the GS Investment Conference presentation made last month by the CFO.  He had the following comments:  The core of the business is very strong.  Data warehousing and data engineering are doing really well.  Many of their largest customers now renew on three year contracts.  The CFO said that between now and the end of 2024 he will do several renewal contracts that will be nine figures.  These customers have chosen SNOW as the platform that they will use and it would be very disruptive to their business to switch to something else."

Now they get assigned shares at $157. That’s a 40% premium with a 3-5 year horizon. Let’s say in 2027 snowflake is $150. The buyer will be returned the $1 billion they gave as loan with zero interest. On the other hand, if the share price is $200. Bond buyer is profitable as he will convert to shares and sell it for a $43 profit per share. Also, it’s 2 billion with 1 billion due in 2027 and 1 billion due in 2029. It’s capped to $397 per share. Meaning the buyer cannot opt for shares on an earlier date unless the stock prices stays above $397. Hope you get this. \n\nThis is a very very smart move and shows the demand from snowflake investors. Most likely snowflake is raising money to make AI acquisitions in the future and 25% goes for buy back. We will see."

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects SNOW) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of SNOW to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;. Those American&#39;s are Taylor Swift-loving 20-something Harris supporters who know NOTHING about the role of investments like ours in providing capital to thecompanies that drive GDP, provide jobs, and make our country a land of opportunity."

They are not in need of any infrastructure investments now. They said that they want to reap the benefit of their Ai investments before any more additional investment in Ai servers. Having said that, the only purpose or need for this exercise is to straighten suppressed stock price.   Another event that is about to occur is the rebalancing of S&amp;P 500 index.  We dont know yet the intened impact of it on SNOW. So this reduction of float and squeeze of short would benefit stock while rebalancing occur."

Often I noticed that that the stock at Schwab indicates HTB meaning Hard to Borrow. This means that the stock is heavily shorted.  This , most likely, be the reason for mgmt to do this.  Company doesnt need money for its operation.  But this financial engineering with forward cap call options will limit the float and force shorts to cover. This is my thesis for this move."

I think what separates this offering versus others out there doing convert debt deals with a capped transaction is SNOW is not using there deal to pay off other debt. That’s part of the confusion for some. Why now? This to me looks like they’re killing two birds with one stone. Raising capital to buy another company and or buyback more shares without using existing cash. At the same time potentially make money on the spread above their cap call strike since the price is currently depressed. Unfortunately it will be misunderstood and mis interpreted initially so expect initial downside but hopefully it will workout for them and longs."

Fluctuations in share prices, while common, can be influenced by various factors, such as company performance, industry trends, and broader economic conditions.\nAs investors, it is essential to review a company&#39;s financial reports, understand its products and competitive advantages, and assess the market&#39;s overall sentiment before making investment decisions. Comparing a company&#39;s valuation to that of its peers can provide valuable insights, but it is crucial to consider all relevant factors and potential risks.\nUltimately, maintaining a long-term perspective and staying informed on the latest developments within the industry can help investors navigate the stock market and make more strategic decisions to safeguard their investments and potentially achieve higher returns."

So, a SNOW investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects SNOW the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for SNOW. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

I had 2 separate sell orders for a large number of shares that I had bought earlier in the day in the 109s (I still have my core position that I leave untouched). One sell order was at $110.37 and the other was at $111.37. The stock was hovering above 110 but moving quickly in both directions a few minutes before regular trading ended. 2 minutes after trading, I noticed both of my sell orders had been filled. I was shocked that my $111.37 order filled because the share price was in the 110s that whole time, so maybe it filled after hours (during that first minute) since my order was a Good Till Canceled + Extended Hours order. I never saw the price go that high on the ticker during that window of time, but it probably filled because of some very high volume late in the day. I was very happy to fill at that price, and I&#39;ll probably buy those shares back for a lower share price than I sold them for on Monday morning."

It was cost that hit the last guidance, a raise in revenues without change in margins. Hopefully, management learned their lesson from the market reaction and will spend less than expected to deliver a &#34;beat&#34; on earnings and future guidance."

Higginbotham \nMajor General, USMC (Ret.)\n  \nFor your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: \n\nKamala Harris&#39; father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris&#39; parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. \n\nThe group&#39;s leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. \n\nFollowing her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown&#39;s political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. \n\nBrown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris&#39; Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris&#39; political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California&#39;s Attorney General.

I believe strongly in SNOW for something like a 2 year timespan. In the meantime, I think I can see a potential drop of up to 8% in NASDAQ for the market doing what it does. Seldom boring.My idea is to be able to relax more with my heavily SNOW weighted portfolios is to buy 2 - 5 x as many SNOWshares in an ETF like UVIX. For the short time I have been tracking it is going 2x NASDAQ in the opposite direction that SNOW is going.I don&#39;t want to get into trading in and out of SNOW, so this seems to make sense to me, and I expect to sleep easier.ps Experts warn about using leveraged funds for longer periods, I intend to stay in until NASDAQ does not look like a roll coaster ready to give us a 8% drop."

Listen to the customer and give them the product that they want.  The CEO works 16 hours a day 7 days a week, &#34;That&#39;s not an exaggeration&#34;.  New products will go into the guidance next year after they have a few quarters of data history.  New products are not in the guidance now.  Today they can say that they&#39;re pleased with the number of customers that are using the new products.  They had been working on some of the new products for many years, they don&#39;t talk about them until they&#39;re well along in development.  They have more new products that are in development now that they&#39;re not talking about now."

But if the company shows that it&#39;s spending more than justified by growth (as it did with the last guidance), SNOW is headed straight to $90. SNOW can&#39;t blame market factors as SaaS peers including NOW, WDAY, and even DDOG are doing fine. I&#39;m long but losing faith in the current leadership. Another disappointment in late Novemebr and I&#39;m going to cut bait and take the loss for taxes."

Remember, Snowflake had a good quarter too, but software was in the doghouse for investors then, but now it seems that&#39;s starting to shift. SNOW has seen a triple bottom in the 107-109 range, and today felt like stabilization before a spike in the share price in the next few days. And once we get through this seasonally challenging time, I believe Snow&#39;s share price will head up 30-50% in Q4."

A couple hours into after-hours trading yesterday, I noticed that the high bid for Snow was 109.50, so I put in a buy order for 1000 shares at 109.51, which would have significantly reduced my cost average and helped me add a lot of shares at an incredible bargain. Unfortunately, only 17 of those shares filled, and I thought about increasing my bid by a few pennies to ensure that I got all of those shares. But I opted not to do that thinking that my whole order would fill at the lower price. It didn&#39;t, and that reluctance to raise my bid by a very small amount cost me almost $7K so far. This is still a great buying opportunity, I think it&#39;s unlikely that Snow will fall to your target price."

He is one of the smartest tech investors around so even he has been taken to the cleaners so far that is. as remember Meta was hammered down from 400 to 88 and now 500. so just because SNOW is down now, doesnt mean it cant come back and I think it will. It is hard to buy when you emotionally you dont want to but that in fact when u buy , when there is blood in streets and when your emotions tell u not to buy , that is when you need fortitude and actually buy.  Pretty sure I heard on CC after q1 that 2nd half will be stronger and stocks disocunt 3-6 mths in advance and we are now in 2nd half so stock should bottom right about now. I wouldnt be surpirsed to see stock back around 170-200 level by year end or Jan 2025"

Consequently, my cost average is $121.85, but if I can hold these shares long enough, I think that will be a great entry point too, even if I didn&#39;t quite buy at the optimal time. Congrats to you on getting shares at that very low price. I just didn&#39;t want to miss out on this opportunity given that it was a good ER with solid guidance, and the stock was already pretty oversold. One big day for the Nasdaq this week, and this could soar back to the 130s."

Rather, you have good reason to be very bullish.Snow will rebound, the only real question is when. It could start in a significant way tomorrow, and will likely be back in the 130s within a couple weeks and likely back around 160-180 by year-end."

Yes, investments for the future are being made, so this affects margins. High growth companies do require up front capital, and with SNOW the longs will be rewarded with a great return. Yes, there is competition with Datebricks, but there is competition with AWS, competition is good. I would rather deploy SNOW, and it is much more integrated, straightfoward to deploy and maintain than the competition. This is why revenue will be double for SNOW vs Databricks as it roughly is today. Once I see a bottom, I&#39;m adding very soon."

The guidance was reasonably strong, but very conservative at the same time, and almost every analyst agrees that Snowflake will far surpass that guidance. If they had given more aggressive, but still honest guidance, the share price would probably be in the 140s now. I think it&#39;s on its way there anyway, but it just might take a few weeks instead of a few days. But if Powell is as dovish as many expect he&#39;ll be today, Snow could make it back to the 125-130 zone by the end of the day. Hope is alive and it&#39;s grounded in solid fundamentals and a very strong future."

We recognize it&#39;s very close to its bottom for this cycle, and isn&#39;t likely to even test that Black Monday 108 level again. This feels a lot like what happened to Lyft after earnings. They too had a solid report, but there were a couple minor things that scared people into a massive selloff. It&#39;s been steadily marching upward since then. Snowflake will recover, and will thrive long-term and medium-term. Seems like an excellent short-term opportunity as well, especially if Powell gives as dovish a speech as expected tomorrow."

They released more new products in the first half of this year than in all of last year, analysts that follow the company are excited about the new products.  Their new AI products have been used by 2500 customers so far.  They have had some pressure on margins because of the investments they are making in engineering and sales.  These investments will pay off in future top line growth.  My take, I think the company can continue to rapidly grow sales and the stock price will move higher over time."

I think this huge after-hours drop will be reversed in a matter of days. Probably 125-130 range tomorrow, perhaps over 130 by Friday (with the likely tailwind of a dovish speech by Powell at the Fed summit), and back to 135 next week.

The CEO was more interested in stock options, than making money for shareholders.  When he bailed, so did I.  The lesson that I learned is that my &#34;investment&#34; in a company without earnings is nothing more than GAMBLING.  Just keep that in mind.  Nothing wrong with a little gambling once in a while, but don&#39;t fool yourself about who is making money with this company, and who isn&#39;t."

I think it’s very obvious that it will. It makes every single aspect of life better. It’s likely the most important innovation to date for the world."
