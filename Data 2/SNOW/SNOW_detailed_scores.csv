Reddit,2024-10-22,"BABA is up 25 over the past year while VOO is up 38 so thats not the success story youre making it out to be. Success in the market isnt just making a profit. If youre not beating the SP then youre losing. Bear in mind that while youre sitting on cash waiting for the next piece of bad news, that money isnt appreciating like it would with a set it and forget it approach. Also every time one of your picks starts to plateau and you decide to sell you have to give the tax man his cut which means you have less to reinvest. If you have to sell before youve owned the stock for a year then youll have to pay capital gains which will cut into your profit even more. All these things plus the fact that there isnt a guarantee that a stock will bounce back from bad news means that this is probably not the slam dunk you think it is. You may get lucky a few times but its probably not a sustainable investing strategy.",Positive,1,0.5688983798027039,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-25,"RIVN is the other pure EV company besides Tesla. Theres an argument RIVN will eventually be viable. They have products people like and a CEO who isnt crazy. The downside is their very small scale and lack of profitability. They didnt expand their production that much this year and steep ongoing losses forced them to mothball their planned new factory in some emergency cost cutting. Those losses also did cast some doubt on their runway and viability to continue. BUT theres counterpoint good news for all of that. One, theyve now been backstopped by a 5 billion ? commitment from VW, so the worries of cash starvation, dilution and bankruptcy are off the table for several years, assuming VW honors the agreement. The modest production numbers do at least reflect accurate and realistic forecasting, and the credibility of the CEO. Many even bet theyd never get to production at all, then doubted how many units. Hes delivered on his promises all along the way, which no other EV company seems to do. Rivian vehicles are expensive, and the headline numbers suggest that they need high margins but that means keeping prices high. The upside is their low production numbers mean at their scale they only need to attract affluent buyers anyway.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"At lower prices it was an intriguing bet for some investment firms because of the riskreward proposition. The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"Going to redirect to ChatGPT because it will answer the question in far more detail than I ever could The behavior youre describing aligns with what some people refer to as swing trading, which involves holding a stock for a short period days to weeks to capitalize on expected price movements. Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way.",Neutral,0,0.9998124241828918,Reply

It comes off the shelf with everything you need and is easy to monitor, straddle and strangle usage and cost. But the savings isnt the _primary_ reason for the valuation free fall 3. SNOW is tanking not so much bc of shifting away comput but but because the valuation was based on machine learning and BI products which would use snowflake compute that never materialized AND guidance was juiced bc they were based on purchased credits NOT credit usage sales reps oversell the fuck outta credits, so much so that most customers will roll over at renewal, purchase less If you think snowflake can figure out and execute on the machine learning product its an excellent long term play precisely because of 1.

Yahoo,2024-10-04,"A 13F has been filed by SG Americas Securities, the US subsidiary of the French financial services giant Socgen.  They owned around 130,000 SNOW shares on June 30, then during July-Aug-Sept they added around 630,000 shares, obviously a huge increase in their position.  Those interested in this company should go to the SNOW site and listen to the GS Investment Conference presentation made last month by the CFO.  He had the following comments:  The core of the business is very strong.  Data warehousing and data engineering are doing really well.  Many of their largest customers now renew on three year contracts.  The CFO said that between now and the end of 2024 he will do several renewal contracts that will be nine figures.  These customers have chosen SNOW as the platform that they will use and it would be very disruptive to their business to switch to something else.",Positive,1,0.9999997615814209,Main

Now they get assigned shares at $157. That’s a 40% premium with a 3-5 year horizon. Let’s say in 2027 snowflake is $150. The buyer will be returned the $1 billion they gave as loan with zero interest. On the other hand, if the share price is $200. Bond buyer is profitable as he will convert to shares and sell it for a $43 profit per share. Also, it’s 2 billion with 1 billion due in 2027 and 1 billion due in 2029. It’s capped to $397 per share. Meaning the buyer cannot opt for shares on an earlier date unless the stock prices stays above $397. Hope you get this.

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects SNOW) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of SNOW to make money for us.

Close enough explanation. I think what separates this offering versus others out there doing convert debt deals with a capped transaction is SNOW is not using there deal to pay off other debt. That’s part of the confusion for some. Why now? This to me looks like they’re killing two birds with one stone. Raising capital to buy another company and or buyback more shares without using existing cash. At the same time potentially make money on the spread above their cap call strike since the price is currently depressed.

Yahoo,2024-09-23,"The volatility experienced by  stocks serves as a reminder of the importance of thorough research and careful consideration when investing in the stock market. Fluctuations in share prices, while common, can be influenced by various factors, such as company performance, industry trends, and broader economic conditions.
As investors, it is essential to review a company&#39;s financial reports, understand its products and competitive advantages, and assess the market&#39;s overall sentiment before making investment decisions. Comparing a company&#39;s valuation to that of its peers can provide valuable insights, but it is crucial to consider all relevant factors and potential risks.
Ultimately, maintaining a long-term perspective and staying informed on the latest developments within the industry can help investors navigate the stock market and make more strategic decisions to safeguard their investments and potentially achieve higher returns.",Neutral,0,0.9778041243553162,Main

THIS IS WHO KAMALA HARRIS REALLY IS!

The History of Kamala Harris
by Geoffrey B. Higginbotham 
Major General, USMC (Ret.)
  
For your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: 

Kamala Harris&#39; father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris&#39; parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. 

The group&#39;s leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. 

Following her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown&#39;s political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. 

Brown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris&#39; Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris&#39; political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California&#39;s Attorney General. Willie Brown, Jr. w",Neutral,0,0.9999159574508667,Main

For a company of this size to continue growing at +35% annually is huge.
