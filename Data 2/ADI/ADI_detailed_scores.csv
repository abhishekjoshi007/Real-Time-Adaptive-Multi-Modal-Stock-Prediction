Reddit,2024-08-01,Analyzing the Analysts Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the SP,Positive,1,0.5726258158683777,Main
Reddit,2024-08-01,"Your table is missing a key piece of data, analysts usually give 12 month price targets, so how accurate did the analysts price turn out to be 12 months later? Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks.",Neutral,0,0.6505180597305298,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,Ill be honest its really not. I came to knowast year that NVDA was priced above 700 pre split but I was scared and only invested in QQQM. It then crossed 1000. I read about analyst ratings about ISRG. I invested a small amount after some research. It has gone 20 since then and has been solid despite tech sell off. I think analyst ratings is helpful to screen companies and not go tits up. I think what is usually lost is that they give a price range and typically most of us dont take risk into account and just invest blindly.,Positive,1,0.9921824336051941,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,Not true. Take a look at stock OTGLY. Its video game company CD Project. It has gone up 40 in last 3 months. Yet I researched and 8 analysts think it is a sell and 4 say it is a buy. I still invested because I follow the company and think there is a significant upside and current analyst opinions are recency bias. So I believe analyst opinions are a piece of information. If you blindly follow then you might get burned but using their opinion as a piece of information to screen stocks is valuable.,Positive,1,0.9926647543907166,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,No one has crystal ball. Again I find it is useful to screen stocks. To follow their arguments for prices. Regarding other question I agree that it cant be 100 right. But some of the opinions are behind paywall. But you still get to see the consensus buysellhold. Also some banks etc are publicly traded right? So they have to be atleast somewhat open about their investments and cant just make shit up. Again we need to do our own research at the end of the day.,Neutral,0,0.9998763799667358,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-09,"While I am actually on your alls viewsidewhatdafukeva you cant deny the overwhelming opinion that this is a loss of opportunity while you wait. The biggest argument is a high yield savings account HYSA will out pace it in a year. I think thats a bit short sighted because their acting like interest rates will never move lower, but their point still stands, currently you would be better off letting it sit and accumulate interest than bag holding. We dont even have to guess at a timeframe or anything. Just take what you would put in intel and calculate your balance in a high yield savings account over the next 2 years by month. That is literally what you are aiming to beat minimum, otherwise its actually a loss for your risk and effort. If in the next 30 days you sell for a 10 pop, great, but the company literally told everyone expect nothing for a year, and even after that, who boy, just know we are working hard and will update then. The longer you hold, the higher that needs to be just to beat the HYSA. Back to the short sightedness of the HYSA . 1 they probably are not doing that, its just a floor they are using to compare what they are doing with their money ex not giving two craps about a 1 dividend and trying to beat it. Their being smart and not marrying the play, stock or HYSA, and we all should be doing that. If the HYSA is no good, dump it and move to the next channel thats best at that time. The difference between intel and HYSA is you can get out of the HYSA at anytime with 0 loss and invest elsewhere, while Intel may have lost value. They 100 dont make perfect plays, but its hard for them to watch others make dumb plays that cant even track interest rates without saying anything. Bottom line, if you plan to be 100 passive, your picks are probably not best, especially if you refuse to pivot when terrible news shows up at the front page of every search engine. Thats why they keep screaming toss it in a fund to people who are doing this.",Neutral,0,0.9789693355560303,Reply

Its down to the price its at because its a shit company compared to what it was. It has an 87b market cap compared to Nvidias 2.6 TRILLION. They are in the same sector, yet Intel is worth 30x less even though they were founded 2 decades earlier. The really hilariously sad part is that you people are only touching the stock out of the fallacious human reasoning of surely it must go back up. If they beat earnings and pumped 25 that day instead of declined, none of you people would be touching it. Missed the boat, its overvalued but because it went down, your primal ape brain is telling you the only logical place for it to go now is back up.
