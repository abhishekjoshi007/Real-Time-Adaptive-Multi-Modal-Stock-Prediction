Yahoo,2024-08-11,"Following the drama with GNS and their battle with the shorts?  I know they are a tiny spec, but over a year ago they hired special lawyers to fight the short abuse and took their fight loudly into the public domain.  Their stock briefly shot up on this, but like all the others who&#39;ve tried to fight back with various methods, their share price has been decimated and now sits at all-time lows, despite substantial growth and very positive metrics.  The CEO a couple of days ago highlighted these stats and the dichotomy of their SP and stated his intentions to buy an additional 10 mil shares.  The stock has been halted ever since.  Nobody knows who halted it or why.  We&#39;ve seen what has happened to the companies who&#39;ve tried to fight back against this evil.  There always seems to be something that falls in favor of the crooks.  We saw it in AMC-APE and the regulators allowance of cash to settle the APE shares, in violation of the company&#39;s intentions.  OSTK is another.  They always seem to find a way.  Are the 10 mil shares for GNS a problem for the MMs?  Is it something else?  This is all being exposed at least one piece at a time.  DMRC is certainly one where there could be tremendous exposure of this nefarious activity and the financial regulators and SROs surely know.  I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen next week, except higher growth, but hopefully there&#39;s something to make the crooks do things they don&#39;t want to do.  In any event, this corruption can&#39;t go on forever.",Neutral,0,0.6264069080352783,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-05,"Off topic but related to overall selloff: The important thing in the financial markets world today is the Japanese Yen vs the USD. Why is it so important? 1. For 30 years Japan has 0% interest on their currency. 2. As a result for 30 years investor borrowed YEN at no cost and invested it globally. They invested in T-Bills abroad and a basket of risk assets including the Nasdaq. 3. For the first time in many year the BOJ increased interest rates this week by 0.25%. This was almost unprecedented. 4. As a result of the increased interest rates and the signal to the market, investors are now concerned that the money they borrowed for free is no longer free and therefore they are unwinding their trades and sending the funds back to Japan. 5.
