We stakeholders learned and understood and were defiant and unwavering, most of us at least, and didn&#39;t succumb to their attacks and tactics.  Their fraudulent narrative and paradigm.  I hope people go to jail and much more. Have their ill gotten gains seized and more. X 10.  Turn rich people into poor people.  I don&#39;t think they have many of those gains here.  For all they spent and are still on the hook for, this one is a loser for them, hopefully a big part of that is us.

BUT, Little Shorty, if he really is kiting the fails-to-deliver, on a stock with an official float of 25% (8mm shares). Meaning, the real short including Little Shorty&#39;s naked short fraud, could be 8mm on a stock where only abt 1mm shares will be available at even $100 p/s. Little Shorty will have to come up with maybe $500mm - $2bn dollars to cover (total guess). Probably can&#39;t do it. Somebody&#39;s going to jail."

All they are doing is deploying P&amp;G&#39;s novel process for recycling polypropylene.  It seems insane vs us and our position in recycling, and then we have all those other huge things with more on the way.  Huge TAM and high margins and moats all around.  IMO. how can we not squeeze and the only question is when?  $3 bil to start would be nice, but we have a long way to go beyond that.  PCT is a good example right now, but a far inferior and very limited business.  What is our squeeze potential?  What&#39;s the true value today?  Next year?  In five years?  Hopefully it&#39;s all a sign that the scourge of fraud and corruption in our currency is about to end.  It should have ended long ago, but my how they held on.  All we&#39;ve done is go up in real value.  It sure seems like a tightly packed bomb right now, does it not?  Tighter and more explosive than ever.

However, why are they reporting lower sequential revenue, guiding lower with lower margins and reporting a slowdown in adoption with longer cycles? Could there be a shift in plans where some players are realizing the bulk of digitization for the actual products is going another way from what they thought? Our way? That&#39;s certainly where it&#39;s going for the actual products we buy. They&#39;ve given the usual seasonality excuse, but that makes no sense to me in this new wave for digitization given all the new wants and needs that are expanding. Just a IMHO observation in this whole big ballgame we&#39;re part of. Our emergence is at hand bigly and ever expanding with the giants and then everyone else.

A couple investors have given up and a couple have come and gone, but for the most part it’s been the same group sitting and waiting for something to happen. Would be nice if management spent some time telling the story and trying to bring on new investors and broaden the investor base, but so far that hasn’t really happened. And Miles, I’ll pre-empt your “but they are telling the story and everyone important knows” rant by saying if they are telling the story they have yet to convince many institutions to buy given the lack of new investors on the holders list."

For a long time here, people have mocked that and used it as an excuse for the stock performance, which we now know had nothing to do with what was really going on in our currency. &#34;If they would only name names&#34;, remember that? Well, we&#39;ve had quite a few names since and most of them giants.  The highest levels of security and trust that we have for our customers is a big asset.  Huge!  Lots of people around this didn&#39;t like that back then or they didn&#39;t understand it.  They wanted to believe something else.  However, this trust is paramount.  In addition to all the other things, we are definitely a security company too.  Anticounterfeiting and theft and fraud protection are areas we know about.  There are going to be a lot more."

Among other reasons the article points to are the costs of sorting and cleaning and in the &#34;what you can do&#34; section explains how people can help sort the better use plastics by looking at the number on the plastic. What?? It all goes into the same bin, what would that do?? And no body is going to look at the numbers anyway. Of course no real solution is talked about, like a modern sorting machine that, aided by invisible water marks, could quickly and cheaply sort plastic and garbage with 95% accuracy.

I own a ton of shares but honestly am looking out years from now..and wont be selling any under 100.  Riley is about to put the stock on the map of Wall Street!

Now I don&#39;t expect the same thing to happen here but there is zero reason why the market cap should be this artificially low...except for the trapped shorts stating -no numbers .....which is no longer true.

How many shares actually change hands each day?  There&#39;s 60% institutional ownership and 86% of the float, 30% insiders not counting all the employees and those of us who don&#39;t file or show up in anything reported is at least 20%.  I think that could be quite a bit more.  We&#39;re all holding tight.  The stock &#34;trading&#34; and pricing is not a reflection of normal market forces, it&#39;s the will of a powerful and controlling force here.  We know that.  In the meantime, the true value of our enterprise is exponentially more and is rising by the day.  So what is the actual short ratio of this powder keg and who is it exactly on the other side of all this?  The ONLY thing they have gotten for their money and all their efforts is time.  The true bill for that hasn&#39;t come in yet.  All we&#39;re watching in this daily stock grind is them doing their thing to avoid paying that bill.  How much longer can they keep doing that?  The numbers don&#39;t lie and the numbers we can here see tell an undeniable story.  The numbers we can&#39;t see are almost certainly going to explosively boost that.

Is anyone else defying the new rules? Hopefully we get change coming and there needs to be a restoration of the uptick rule and a complete ban on naked shorting for everyone, as well as existing law being enforced including the prohibited use of computer program trading technology to manipulate prices. I know of a few people in the public eye who are behind cleaning up all of this who will likely serve in the new guard if they get the chance. Is Wall Street nervous? Everything at the top keeps going up while everything below does what we see. How big are the stakes over this potential power shift? Have they ever been bigger? See the giant financial firms&#39; earnings this week, mostly off their &#34;trading&#34;? Where does all that money really come from? Desperate people do desperate things. Those with power trying to hang on can be particularly dangerous. It seems business as usual for the moment, but how long will that last? HODL!"

It isn&#39;t like there&#39;s one guy at WMT who says we&#39;re going to do this. They need to convince and then integrate an incredible number of suppliers, etc,Reading between the lines, it would make sense for WMT to use the DW end-to-end. Supply chain. Check out. Analytical data they can sell to suppliers, shippers. List goes on.Sorry to repeat myself, but, IMO, If WMT buys DMRC it would make them competitive with Amazon&#39;s Everything Store -- albeit, AMZN makes most of its profits from AWS. But, AMZN doesn&#39;t have a fraction of the physical presence of WMT. And, third party sales are quite profitable.Finally, if you Google Mark Hardy, there&#39;s an 8/19/24 interview on Greenbook re: Luminate. (Maybe that was posted here and I missed it.)"

We saw what they just did with the reported short to press and hold, but that&#39;s nothing compared to what they might do when full desperation kicks in.  Do they have any cards left to play?  Be ready to HODL and strap in tight.  Sooner or later we are going to see that show and it&#39;s looking near.  Hopefully they don&#39;t have anything left except a whimper.  We&#39;ll see."

Seeing that yesterday made my blood boil.  We&#39;re in a state of pure lawlessness and it&#39;s the elites and their surrogates who are the true gangsters and criminals against the people.  I&#39;m believing that story more every day about Goldman getting rebuffed and then turning their guns on us, at least being part of this blob that&#39;s been sitting on us.  The biggest question now for sure is, who are they and why do they have it in for DMRC?  IMO this definitely goes way beyond them just trying to make money on their big short.

For three + months we&#39;ve seen gradual, but steady decrease in the official short interest. Then all of a sudden, all of that and some more gone quickly. Look at all the news and new developments we&#39;ve had over that span. We see their press down at the end of the month and quarter for sure. They had to shuffle chairs on their deck and short into the mkt to do it. Did any move across the water too? That we can&#39;t see, but what we can clearly see is that they manufactured the drop themselves. No doubt about that, That&#39;s been the case all along and for years. Nobody here knows anything about the size, scope and power of this monster criminal sitting on top of us, or at least no one who&#39;s willing to speak up, but we know they are there and we know they are huge. You can&#39;t deny it or blame or scapegoat anything else. We&#39;re living through massive history here on so many levels. Someone and something truly awful and evil with all the power to do these things, and I suppose more, sits hidden and free to do this (for now) on the other side of us. Who are they? Who let this happen? They can&#39;t stop Walmart and all the others. All that we have now. Who and what exactly are we surviving? We&#39;re going to find out. For now truly understand it and have nothing to keep you from HODLing! they&#39;ve for sure shown us that that have no intention to stopping fighting us."

There have been far too many examples of that over the years to dismiss. If you&#39;ve been following this discussion for a while and haven&#39;t asked yourself why, you have to now. I&#39;ve been asked many questions over the time he&#39;s been doing this about nonsense he&#39;s introduced that seemed plausible to some. Who knows what he&#39;s thrown out in the cyber sphere that has struck with some? It has to be purposeful. What could the real story of that be? Who could that be for and why? They are all pretty blatant, but this one takes the cake. There&#39;s been nothing anywhere ever to even suggest that anything WMT is doing is short term in nature and a two year or &#34;several&#34; limit is nowhere in anything related to them. He made it up on the fly, just like all the others. The only question left now is, why? I&#39;m guessing that WHY is the reason for his clashes with some back to the beginning. As blatant as this one is, we know the next one won&#39;t be far behind. He hasn&#39;t been &#34;short&#34; on his creativity and I believe he&#39;s obliged to continue."

I think WMT is rolling out the implementation of Digimarc Illuminate and retail experience in Mexico and Canada first. WMT is massive with tons of software and Digimarc is now writing its own software and doing some of it for WMT according the August Call. In addition, note the WMT contract expired in September, 2024 of this year that was signed in 2022. Ask yourself why would a guy in Mexico who works for Walmart do this post he did? I think there is a very good chance we get a major announcement before year end regarding WMT renewing the contract that expired last month and re-read RM comments from the call.  Coincidences like this are not chance!"

This should ultimately increase the size and time-to-market of the  “razor” component of this flywheel, not only with our initial customer, but with  subsequent ones as well.While I cannot provide any additional details at this time, I want to emphasize two key points. First, it is difficult to overstate the importance of these developments.  Second, we expect and look forward to being able to share more information soon.&#34;-obviously talking about WMT."

While the meaning of &#39;Scintilla&#39; nods to our Walmart legacy, it also positions us for the future, enabling more seamless expansion to new markets and banners across our global enterprise. This expansion has already started, having launched our product suite in Mexico earlier this summer, and we’re excited to share it will be available in Canada later this month. It looks like we are powering this but for now that is an assumption!"

I don&#39;t think WMT is strong arming the national brands in the same way, or that they can, but we have learned from Riley&#39;s description how they are pushing all of them to their (with us) solution and platform. I would love to see what the natl brands got from WMT explaining this and what they need to do. If they sell through WMT, and they all do, they have very strong incentives to do it and they benefit themselves in countless other ways with all those capabilities. They also have to comply with laws and directives like the FMSA. The evidence of this happening is clear and it fits exactly with what we&#39;ve been told. Under normal circumstances, without all the malfeasance around the stock, this would be a big story and not something hidden in plain view under this gangster smokescreen. Does this fit too with our transition to the easier way of doing business with us and this new model through our partners? WMT is most definitely pushing the needle and the gas pedal for us now. We were told the end of this year is going to be exciting. How are the crooks going to keep this in check."

Better data and inventory management are key.  It looks like we&#39;re starting to see what Riley was alluding to about them in his CC comments.  This company with the post is a 3rd party trying to capitalize on what WMT is driving with all those brands they carry.  There will likely be lots of them.  Think our people knew in advance this was kicking in when they shared what they said to us before?  Think we&#39;re going to see higher revenue?  Leading to the kind of revenue that Riley seems very excited about?  Are there any other things kicking in?"

Have you noticed along all of our walkdowns that the shares are usually up a bit first thing in the morning, and then reverse shortly after for another leg down, day after day after day?  This is called baiting and is part of the spoofing.  They are getting into the details of how they use their algos to bait and stuff orders in ways to drive down the price and fool the public.  That&#39;s just one of a number of frauds used to manipulate.  Interesting stuff for sure!  We&#39;ve seen countless examples of exactly that here.  Do we have another this morning?  Just like yesterday morning?  A million other mornings?  Are we gradually approaching anything where these thugs are going to get more desperate?

If you believe that they are trapped like I do, then a trapped animal will use every tactic to escape. The settlement of trades to 1 day (effective in May of this year) certainly has made their &#34;Float&#34; gig that much more difficult but make no mistake if they were giving up and covering aggressively the stock would be well over 50 bucks. Only Mgt knows if they have time on their side but there is literally no reason (at least publicly known) for them to cover until Mgt puts up Bigly numbers. This short position is likely less than 1% of their quant hedge fund. Until big numbers or a big event happens the algo will continue to push the share price wherever it wants to.  Their goal is to create fear, uncertainty, panic, so that longs give in and sell. Not going to happen....at least with me!  Until we get material news the stock will remain a ping pong ball!

Your slee-chief mantra of &#34;some&#34; manipulation, but the company needs....... and .......... and ..........,  Deflection from the real truth of the massive scale of control the gangsters have here, and many others as well.  You are in bed with them somehow.  Perhaps we&#39;ll find out, but in the meantime, you just keep on going.  This is a leviathan in too many ways to keep count now.  There are too many examples of far lesser enterprises and valuations that are exponentially higher.  Some with no revenue or the massive list of partners and customers + governments we have.  We know there is something far more sinister and larger going on here and it covers far more than just the stock trading and control.  This control-fraud in the system is far bigger than we know or think and the power of those names who are against us here is almost incomprehensible.  That is as long as they are able to run free.  I&#39;ve seen it enough in other victims, contracts, revenue increases, good developments etc are all controlled or muted.  They keep them all light years away from fair value.  Your post here has but one purpose, just like countless others.  You all want cover in our minds from the actual truth of this and you want to drive your narrative that all this is somehow because of what&#39;s lacking or in waiting.  These narrative attempts are true in all the things around us we know are fraudulent and manipulated in this world we&#39;re in.  The crooks never want us to see.  You are one of them."

Make no mistake.....a big jump in revenues are coming from Recycling and hopefully WMT finally pushes brands to adopt like shareholders were promised on the last call and 3 yrs ago. DMRC is still an emerging growth story but Longs have the advantage because I see ZERO reasons for them to sell at 28 bucks, 14 bucks or 40 bucks....

They are commercializing P&amp;G&#39;s novel plastic recycling tech and process, have very costly buildout and upfront costs and an expensive process with low margins and so far, zero revenue. $1.5B market cap! They also have a very large short. They just did a secondary at $4.69 and an extension of a credit facility and the shares have doubled in price since in the few days since. They also have $340 mil in debt. Things that make you go hmmmmmm. If they are worth 1.5 bil for recycling, we&#39;re worth multiples of that. We all know we are in the midst of a completely rigged and controlled game and worth exponentially more than the price. We also know that we have very rich and powerful interests against us. So why do we have these massive dichotomies? We know why, just not who is pulling those strings that make them on the right side of things up and down.  PCT is a good comparison in the plastic recycling space.  We have an infinitely better and more widespread business there with huge margins and mandates to drive.  Standardization.  Nothing makes sense anymore.  We just have to wait till it does again or something happens to catch everyone off guard.  With the reality of what we have and all that it means and is going to do, that&#39;s inevitable."

Your contract, contract, contract mantra is pure nonsense. We have to kill a monster and it looks like we have more than plenty, including this, to do just that.

If it can be shown that this happened, and then after refusal GS participated in what we&#39;ve experienced and recently seen in the control, assault and molesting of our stock, well then, that&#39;s certainly something if you have authorities willing to enforce and angry people wanting justice.  People like us perhaps.  A new guard brings new possibilities, but there could be those already waiting in the wings.

I posted something about 4-5 years ago about this and a discussion with Bruce about the future of theft protection and a neighbor who left a big box retailer to work at a startup putting tiny cameras throughout retail stores everywhere there was electricity.  Light fixtures, shelving, displays, you name it.  The cameras are cheap and plentiful and easy to set up throughout the stores, and now we can add in AI and tracking.  It&#39;s incredible how many things we talked about in theory over all that time while all that malfeasance was going on with the stock and now, we see them for real.  There is no question that we see here the new standard for retail security, and it&#39;s being led by Walmart, who&#39;ve led countless other tech innovations that have become standard throughout retail and supply chains.   This today is monumental!"

Anyone see the bruhaha Citadel and others are putting up over the CAT system fighting it and trying to get the regulators have the public investors, and not them, to pay for the system and the expenses they incur?  Every day we learn something new and seemingly more awful than the day before.  People like slee want you to believe that something the company will or can do is going to fix this and change everything.  A few of us know it&#39;s something far bigger and more sinister than what he portrays.  The good news is that we have something that truly stands head and shoulders above most anything else, is so disruptive and needed that even if nothing changes with this corrupt system, will overcome.  This is far too big and there&#39;s just too much money involved with the biggest players on earth to stop it or keep it contained.  We should be hearing a lot more about all that very soon."

Did you know that BAC- Merrill Lynch is the largest counterparty to Ken Griffin-Citadel and their exposure is massive?  I did not, but I&#39;ve known for a long time they were crooks.  These giant financial pillars, huge banks and big names in financial services are mostly part of this whole grift against the people and our economy with the publicly traded businesses they bleed.  There are countless victim companies, their employees and families and investors.  It&#39;s the biggest license to steal in human history.  That $3 mil fine is like so many others we&#39;ve seen and it gets them off the hook for stealing enormous sums without further repercussion.  The regulators are captured and there is a revolving door back and forth with those people from the agencies to the companies they are supposed to watch over and enforce the law.  At least now we know.  This is the state of our country right now.  Corruption reigns.  What are we going to learn about all this evil next?"

It seems the volume has dropped off across the board on these victims.  That makes sense and we still have to wait a year before they will show us the CAT data.  Anonymized of course.  We&#39;re still waiting for the FTD data from our latest bear raid, which is running late.  Is there anyone left out there who still argues all this is nothing more than conspiracy theory or have they all been blown away by the facts?  It looks like real world views of our success are about to crank.  As we watch this show go on, what will our enemies do?  Their tricks don&#39;t work and weapons are being diminished.  Interesting times ahead for sure!"

And, they (generally) try to stay within the law when they can. They MADE money on their short and have likely moved on and are covered in one way or another on the 2mm shares they borrowed.DMRC is now plagued by Little Shorty. A bunch of Jordan Belfort&#39;s that attack many stocks similar to DMRC via FTD&#39;s + spoofing + options.I contacted a well-known lawyer (who shall remain anonymous here) fighting Little Shorties, he told me that even with the best news in the world, on a closely held microcap, Little Shorty can continue using his strategy. Therefore, the number of shares traded doesn&#39;t mean much. Little Shorty is never stuck. Never has to cover because he never borrowed shares. It&#39;s a total scam that&#39;s hard to prosecute. And, if they&#39;re foreigners, they may be out of the SEC&#39;s jurisdiction, anyway.Check out the low recorded short position on, eg, LPTH. Clearly a victim of Little Shorty. Capped at $1.40. But, very low reported short position."

Assumptions: zero holidays between now and Jan 1st, 2025, zero additional longs buying shares, or existing ones adding, zero news flow from DMRC.  If shorts can cover 1500 shares for each -30 min intervals (1295 in total) that would allow them to cover 1,942,000 shares ....and likely at much higher prices. But if they really think they will get meaningful sellers during the next 4 months, or they just continue to &#34;Cap&#34; the stock price without covering .....the vacuum they have created gets even stronger!  --Let&#39;s hope they are not covering!

You can tell the author knows very little, but this is too big of a thing taking place for that to remain static. There&#39;s no doubt the awareness of all this is going to expand tremendously. All the CPGs and retailers will be fully involved and people everywhere are certainly going to notice the changes in how we interact with products and all the new things we&#39;ll see and be able to do. As far as mentioning DMRC or DW, there may be a benefit from a business standpoint not to have everyone know what&#39;s in the secret sauce. We have all the chess pieces that deal with the CPGs and retailers at every level. Our partners, VARs and COEs. For the stock, we want to see it, but for doing the business, the customers get what they need and want and are dealing directly with our partners in their name and evrythng flows to us. It&#39;ll all show up one way or another, but most of all, to our bottom line.  IMO we have a perfect setup with all of the most important players.

In other words, how does the QR compare to a standard (DW) that already is being legislated into widespread use? ,How can the WSJ leave that out? (Although, WSJ ain&#39;t what it used to be.

All three have done nothing but make the share supply even tighter than it already was because no material selling occurred other than the borrowed shares by shorts. 2 million shares plus are going to have to buy back at much higher prices than 30 bucks imho.....it may take time (months) or days depending upon news events with financial implications, but the noose is getting tighter around their necks and I doubt they continue to attack the stock under 35 bucks going forward given the news flow that is coming in the weeks and months ahead. I have been wrong before on my calls and price projections, but the stock is headed much higher in the next 3 to 8 months! GLTA I was able to buy another 20k shares to add to my large pile! Time to watch them scurry and chase the ask in 2024 and 2025. Or they might want to smarten up-cover quickly and re-short at $100 bucks! LOL."

You can&#39;t do all you need to do with just them and they have the same issues as traditional barcodes for scanning orientation and are not secure.  You have to make them 2D ++.  Sunrise 2027 is certainly a big deal.  Everyone, as we&#39;ve been told, is on a digital transformation journey and the things that it will enable are vast and explosive.  One thing right off the bat the article missed IMO is that you don&#39;t need hardware upgrades for the vast majority of applications for the retailers and CPGs.  Sure, you&#39;ll have digital shelf labels and machines needed for applications like3 recycling, but by and large, this all works and works very well with existing scan and processing machines and equipment throughout the chains.  It&#39;s a good introduction and we know much more is going to follow.  EVRYTHNG is going to follow in droves!"

They have to know their time for doing this is going to end and if Gensler gets fired on Day 1 as has been stated, IMO we can assume things will change rapidly following that.  Wall Street gangsters are nervous.  The powers likely to be know the problem is huge and America is being stolen blind.  What are they going to do?  What calamity will they try and unleash to hold on to that grift and power?  Buckle up!  We know the back half of the year is going to be chocked full of great things.  Four months left.  Now the clock is really ticking and faster and that light at the end of the tunnel is a train coming straight at them."

That&#39;s where I began on this path with a large success and some others that followed. It&#39;s what led me to DMRC. This introduction of that aspect of this business is bread and butter! If we are already in the retailers with our OS (Digital Link) and the products digitized with our tech, it&#39;s a natural progression and should be far easier than any solutions before. IMO, it&#39;s another big revelation for us as this story unfolds. Retailers will crawl through broken glass to get this benefit alone! Then of course you have all those other benefits with many more to come. Given his constraints, Riley is laying evrythng out beautifully for us.  If we didn&#39;t have the capture and fraud in the stock, it would be a completely different ballgame learning these things.  The malfeasance is blinding."

This is where I started 25 years ago with a system that became a quasi-standard for years.  What solutions are we going to provide?  Cameras everywhere tracking evrythng.  Knowing where evrythng is at all times is paramount.  One thought is access control of locked merchandise without having store employees go through the tedious work of unlocking things customer by customer, item by item.   I am sure there are many other solutions that can be built on top of this technology.  We&#39;re already providing security to supply chains and that will grow like a weed.  Having every product digitized properly can unlock countless solutions everywhere.  We have the building blocks and supporting system for it all.  Is this another use case to be excited about?  How many are there now?"

As long as they are in control, they will fight and not allow anything that would clean this up and make it fair.  They make too much money and have no interest in protecting the public.  This would take away the fungibility of financial assets along with the security and other benefits.  Like how blockchain would make many financial intermediaries obsolete and the way they&#39;ve been fighting that, this would disrupt too many of their paradigm grifts.  If the current powers that be lose control, we will start to see a number of innovations.  It all goes back to ownership rights and the security of that.  If things happen to allow systems to operate freely and efficiently, IMO this is inevitable.  We should be able to start thinking more in this direction with the prepaid card development.

I hate being right about things like this, but there you have it.   Think little tokens of insider buys or publicity would go up against that and what kind of power do you think they wield on the street?  This came after they got their hand slapped for &#34;mismarking&#34; all those millions and millions of trades.  Was this a change of tactic away from the usual?

I believe Riley is following the same MO Bruce used in holding quiet about big developments and then telling us a little before they become official and sealed. He did that with recycling and a couple of months later we got Holy Grail. Obviously this card security biz is something that&#39;s been in the works for a while. Easy to miss, but he also made reference to other retail theft and diversion. Did you hear what he said about the size of this vs our other big markets TAM and future cash flows? Nothing else tried worked, but our stuff does! Is this applicable beyond the prepaid stuff? It certainly sounds like a big enough thing to blow the socks off the investment world and in the financial services arena. Think anyone is going to be able to cover this up? My interpretation is we got it!!! Otherwise, I don&#39;t believe he would say a peep. Go back and listen to what he described! The big short tried to squash this development today along with everything else. They have their work cut out for them once this becomes official."

You know this means they added more customers than they hoped, right?  It all means more business, not less, nor does it mean there is a slowed down acceleration rate.  I think this new program means they have made it easier to do business with and will grow faster from it.  The WMT development described looks like prep for massive scale.  Do all these brands need advanced digitization and solutions more or less, esp with reg requirements?  Just a little more common sense through the smoke.  This is insane, but we&#39;re all used to it by now knowing why.  How much longer can they keep doing this given the truth of this picture?"

We might even get some guidance from RM tonight, but I am not counting on it. Bigger numbers will be coming.....but the question is when?  RM has been at the helm for 4 yrs., been away from his family in FL so likely would like to put this equity (his investment) on the map with Wall Street ASAP! Numbers will do this along with Strategic investment partners. Does it happen tomorrow or in 2025 remains to be seen. I can wait and continue to buy the dips/attacks! GLTA"

IDK. But, fighting off Little Shorty (that is, the spoofer + FTD strategy) is probably legally difficult and also time consuming.With any luck, one of the other lawsuits or prosecutions will take out Little Shorty. But, I wouldn&#39;t count on it. And, you can&#39;t say it&#39;s completely unreasonable (this would be a legal argument) to short a co w/out a record of profitability and an $800mm valuation. So, that makes prosecution more difficult.It&#39;s frustrating. But, I think we&#39;ll have to wait. Although, I really, really, really hope I&#39;m wrong."

IMO it is impossible that something like this in such a position could go on indefinitely without someone or something in that movers and shakers bunch thinking about and acting on the opportunity and trying to scoop it up as advantageously as possible. I&#39;m not predicting any kind of deal in this realm anytime soon and I hope to and intend to be an owner forever, but I do believe at least parts of this are inevitable. I&#39;ve never seen a better candidate. The stock and that whole illusion means nothing. Too many people in the real world involved in all this who also have money, power and influence know! The longer this corrupt nonsense goes on with this expanding as it is and with all those huge names and everyone else in tow, the more likely this becomes. It&#39;s an incredible thing we&#39;ve lived through here and seen. I know what I would be thinking if I were out there on the needing it end if I had such money and power in this paradigm. &#34;If we are allowed to remain independent&#34; comes to mind too.

The answer to that question will come when the rest of Wall Street sees the &#34;boulders&#34; that RM mentioned on the last call hit the books!

I know they are a tiny spec, but over a year ago they hired special lawyers to fight the short abuse and took their fight loudly into the public domain.  Their stock briefly shot up on this, but like all the others who&#39;ve tried to fight back with various methods, their share price has been decimated and now sits at all-time lows, despite substantial growth and very positive metrics.  The CEO a couple of days ago highlighted these stats and the dichotomy of their SP and stated his intentions to buy an additional 10 mil shares.  The stock has been halted ever since.  Nobody knows who halted it or why.  We&#39;ve seen what has happened to the companies who&#39;ve tried to fight back against this evil.  There always seems to be something that falls in favor of the crooks.  We saw it in AMC-APE and the regulators allowance of cash to settle the APE shares, in violation of the company&#39;s intentions.  OSTK is another.  They always seem to find a way.  Are the 10 mil shares for GNS a problem for the MMs?  Is it something else?  This is all being exposed at least one piece at a time.  DMRC is certainly one where there could be tremendous exposure of this nefarious activity and the financial regulators and SROs surely know.  I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen next week, except higher growth, but hopefully there&#39;s something to make the crooks do things they don&#39;t want to do.  In any event, this corruption can&#39;t go on forever."

For 30 years Japan has 0% interest on their currency. 2. As a result for 30 years investor borrowed YEN at no cost and invested it globally. They invested in T-Bills abroad and a basket of risk assets including the Nasdaq. 3. For the first time in many year the BOJ increased interest rates this week by 0.25%. This was almost unprecedented. 4. As a result of the increased interest rates and the signal to the market, investors are now concerned that the money they borrowed for free is no longer free and therefore they are unwinding their trades and sending the funds back to Japan. 5. The estimated quantum of this trade is over $4 trln!!Got to love that leverage till it has to unwind!"
