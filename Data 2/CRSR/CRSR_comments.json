They IPOed at the right time, when the world was stay at home, and is just one of the many stocks that was lifted during an extraordinary point in history. The same thing is happening with DELL today, they benefitted from stay at home, and benefit from AI buildout today, but they havent done anything special. Its better to invest in companies that grow revenues by their own merit, and not by extraordinary external events."

Theyve made progress in peripherals but their market is niche mostly gamers and streamers. Compare that to Logitech which does peripherals for that market AND office, work from home, travel. Struck me as a decent company in a bad space. I just dont see where they can find more customers or sales to start growing again."

There is no real path for this stock to recover pc gaming isnt showing signs of picking up soon, competition like Logitech, razer and gigabyte will continue to put pressure on their margins. Also as a pc gamer I have no loyalty to third party manufacturer, I will go for the best reviewed and cheapest options most of the time. I liked my Corsair components but other companies are just as good or better. As far as their own products, they arent as good imo. If Im paying 100 for a keyboard or 50 for a mouse I wont be getting another Corsair, they were okay but should be 13 the price compared to competitors"

Logitech tend to beat them on peripherals. They dont innovate. As an avid pc builder and fan of this sector, Id never invest in them and think theyre going to beat the SP500. Pc building is cyclical, along with COVID and WFH the 30 series and equivalent AMD gpus increased pc building fervour, but its likely going to be a few years before another wave like that, if at all given the catalysts at the time. Corsair are in every pc space near enough but dont excel in any of them. For me, Id either treat as a long term hold and DCA, or wait for an increase in market sentiment to bring them a bit higher and cut losses and treat as a lesson. Basically the whole market is down at the moment in tech so wouldnt sell at the moment."

Its not the best, but its not terrible. I have used their keyboards, I have a Corsair case for my pc, and I have dabbled a bit with their mice. I even used their ram for my previous pc. I even have a Corsair mouse pad that is their best product to date that I have purchased besides the ram. Nearly all their products serve their purpose but the arent known for their quality and gamers will gravitate towards more expensive or higher quality products after they become more experienced in understanding the market. Corsair products are for first time pc gamers that are trying to stay within budget but still put out a product that feels like a device for a gamer. And as you examine the peripheral market you will find...Razer, Logitech, Zowie, Glorious O and others put out a superior product. I use to not be a razer guy but their products are much higher quality but a higher price point. Though I think Logitech and Razer are beginning to recognize that budget products have a market. Point is that Corsair sort of like eating a Big Mac when one could go to Five Guys or In and Out or a Gourmet Burger place. It does the job in satisfying your appetite, but leaves a lot to be desired. Corsair has not figured out their market, they are just trying to capture all the gamers as a whole and this is why they did well financially with the gamer boom and are now struggling a bit. You should have sold two years ago because this company still has no clear plan forward."

No hate to racing but why does Fanatec limit themselves to just one kind of technology. Their knowledge seems extensive, I would like to seem Fanatec branch out into other sectors so the knowledge isnt wasted. FPS devices could get better, I remember when the wii made these guns that you fit the remote into, Squads the pc game could be targeted for this because its the most realistic roleplay military sim game. Anyways they could make their own line of weapons that had sensors for something on your tv. IDK, it would be cool to get into talks. Also 2026 when gta drops. I could see people buying fanatec racing car simulators and weapons to freaking hold, Anyways, Corsair seems really discounted rn but personally I wouldnt feel safe about it. It sucks because I really like corsair and even bought some of their equipment including but not limited to, my pc case."

Their hardware architecture for QPU has a competitive advantage.Their ion chain has all-to-all connectivity on the chain which means for each qubit they double the computational space, and a lot of the interesting research coming out utilizing their hardware specifically cites the all-to-all connectivity for providing computational advantage.Their all-to-all connectivity also means they can run any two-gate operation on any part of the chain. The likes of superconductors have to do an operation to get to each other part of the platform to do a two-gate which adds operations and errors.Their ion chain also has exceptionally long coherence time - meaning they can run operations on the chain and maintain the state of the chain for long periods of time. Minutes. Compared to other quantum hardware which is microseconds.Their biggest ding is that their gate speeds are slower compared to other quantum hardware like superconducting, but I am happy from an investor perspective trading slower speed on the machine for much higher quality qubit and usable qubit. It&#39;s easier to speed something up that has a good foundation than it is to make a bad foundation good.I have not even touched on what they are doing with networking (which is where a lot of their government contracts are starting) and applications.Now it&#39;s just the waiting game for them to monetize this and get to cash-flow-positive and make all the early accumulators wealthy. That&#39;s the hope at least."

The SP speculatively blew sky high creating an unrealistic value which turned  IONQ into a meme stock, a play thing of “rediters” in no time. The forum got filled with disrespectful, wanna be rich tomorrow adolescents.\n\nI personally won’t touch this until I hear something solid, something that will generate capital for the company like real world applications.\n\nHoping to wake up to a different narration. Their wall is covered with tens of patents but the narration hasn’t changed much.\n\nOne last thing, not enough transparency."

Republicans favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andseek to empower investors and industry to expand, grow, andemploy while limiting government spending. Democrats lean towardSocialism and seek to tax investors and industry for the purposesof distributing wealth to the masses via large social spending programs.Throughout history, societies that favor Free Enterprise Capitalism andgrow their economies via private sector incentives are societies and growand prosper. Societies that over-tax investors and private sector industrytend to stagnate and decline. Even China, which is an authoritarian, one-party state, greatly accelerated it&#39;s wealth and prosperity over the last 25years though capitalist reforms and incentives.In this election, the choice between a Free-enterprise capitalist candidateand a big government socialist candidate has never been more stark.Mr. Trump governed as the former and expanded GDP faster, 8 to 10 yearsfollowing the most recent recession, at all time record rates and he did itwith minimal inflation and very high employment.Biden/Harris passed record social spending and gunned inflation to the highestlevels in over 40 years, which led to high interest rates and everything from eggsto housing extremely unaffordable and wages/salaries significantly lagging thecost of living.The choice, should be very clear."

Based on ATR expansion combined with the a few overbought signals flashing on the daily chart, I would not be surprised to see a mild pull back this week or a sell the news event after earnings. Fundamentally nothing has changed , but technically I think we are overbought and need a pause to fuel the next leg up. If you are looking to add mores shares at a lower price ...we may get that opportunity soon. Not selling here, and I would not go short either, but I think buying more at this juncture is a little risky considering the runup so far."

Fundamentally this company has all the tools to be the next disruptive big tech but needs to cover more ground to prove its abilities. It’s good that the US government is backing it but other than Quantum Basel there hasn’t been any other private sector interest in their tech. We need to see more system sales. Plus December will be an important month to see one of their flagship systems up and running. \n\nI’ve seen people claiming to be long time investors, some even claiming to be invested since 5 years ago. (They IPOed 2021) I’ve been jumping in and out since spring of last year and I must say I witnessed the same run up to 20 with zero fundamentals and witnessed the same volatility that day and swing traders have caused. Where there is speculation there will always be volatility. I believe the current price is artificial and mostly caused by the discrepancy between the bid and ask prices of daily trading.\n\nLong story short I too expect a correction soon if not today."

Based on ATR expansion combined with the a few overbought signals flashing on the daily chart, I would not be surprised to see a mild pull back this week or a sell the news event after earnings. Fundamentally nothing has changed , but technically I think we are overbought and need  a pause to fuel the next leg up. If you are looking to add mores shares at a lower price ...we may get that opportunity soon.  Not selling here, and I would not go short either, but I think buying more at this juncture is a little risky considering the runup so far."

There is no produced device yet in the Taiwan project and that project and IonQ would apparently not address the same markets or competitive specs.  Someone in the US should license any patents involved from the Taiwan project ASAP.Your posts take up too much space with no information payoff in reading them.  You can do better.

Similarly to the required nuclear energy needs that are now going to be required so will the need for quantum which once fully implemented the world will never be the same and we will likely be in route to mars with a robots on board able to provide the unanswered question of our universe and whether life exist in any other planet. In the event a small modular reactor and AIG is able to be deployed into our solar system space exploration will have taken the biggest leap in the history of mankind&#39;s civilization to what other planets will thoroughly be examined in a depth whereby what cannot be done today. But quantum, small modular reactor and AIG will need to be part of the complete deployment in order to meet the astronomical goals only dreamt of by astronomers and scientist today. Bottom line I believe our most advance supercomputer are running the computation to bring it all today as fast as humanly possible.In the event Ionq, Inc. is trading well above $50+ in 2025 it will begin to confirm my comments..."

Maybe it was one of the quantum tech advances reported last week that got investors excited, or maybe that China claim of hacking encryption with quantum that suddenly woke up investors to the imminent and serious practical uses of quantum, or maybe some material link with the AI field that could really ramp up quantum demand soon. I just can&#39;t recall a time when all the quantum stocks made a big run when the rest of the markets and the AI stocks weren&#39;t really moving, suggesting that the move was unique to the quantum stocks this time and that the move could just be the start of a massive longer-term run like AI had last year.  Lightning strikes quick and totally unexpectedly in the markets, lol."

Currently the most powerful computer (Front 👂 ) at Oakridge is 1.2 quintillion states.He also talks about them working on AQ256. At AQ120 it have “more computational states than the number atoms in the known universe universe - all 14 billion light years across.” And for every additional AQ between 120 and 256 the computational power DOUBLES. It’s incomprehensible 🤯The podcast has only had 677 views….. and they’re discussing the technology and THE COMPANY that is going define the human race’s scientific advancement over the next decade. There are a fantastically small number of people who are even aware of what a QC or an AQ is let alone the impact they’re going to have. Without wishing to sound too hyperbolic, I truly believe this is a once in a lifetime investment opportunity and the few on this board are in at sub basement level. Paul (UK)"

That makes sense, most asset managers don&#39;t understand entanglement or superposition. This has led to questions about the profitability of the company, like if it can actually be achieved. As we secure more and more contracts and revenue keeps growing exponentially, it becomes clearer that we&#39;re not selling snake oil. The short sellers made a good profit when an absence of excitement caused a prolonged downtrend, but now it seems that this trend is over. I have no doubt that a lot of shorts have been buying to cover recently."

That is like standing in front of an oncoming freight train and thinking it&#39;s going to stop.   I am quite sure you&#39;ve seen what has happened since we traded 45 million shares on the AF contract news.   We already consolidated the gains we made from that day and the volume has stayed strong, this is going higher.    Building nuclear power plants to power these data warehouses, really?   The main function of these warehouses is to store and crunch data for the purpose of selling you something you don&#39;t need.  It seems our entire tech sector is built around that very notion and how we are going nuclear to power it.   Build a nuclear power plant or string together a couple IONQ quantum computers?

There appears no other alternative for example for NVDA computation to meet the goal it seeks without quantum technology. There are only very few in this sectors that will be able to meet the requirement the likes of IonQ, which currently lead me to believe the share price today is vastly inexpensive and the end of this year going into 2025 and beyond bringing about a share price that expectation not realized. Bottom line is the newer development of the all existing networks and the new will eventually need to be modernized to or with quantum technology to fully achieve the the levels and potential of computation that will not be able to be met with todays configuration."

His dad was an astronaut.  After listening to Peter, I have full faith in him and his team to push the boundaries in quantum computing.  Not only is Peter a well spoken ceo, he also is a physics genius!  I recommend you listen if you are interested in ionq."

Space X largest rocket was successfully landed on the chopsticks and Starship is just another test flight away from complete success. Robots and autonomous transportation is beginning to pick up traction. Bottom line is the rise of data centers and evolution to deploy small modular reactors for zero carbon emission and sustainable energy is leading to quantum computing. Once all these technologies continue to unfold in a more rapid pace of what is being called the 4th industrial evolution is when I will agree we will have some true footprint on the moon and will be on a the first real mission to Mars. In order for it all to truly come together it lies on AI/AIG Quantum and IonQ should likely become a major beneficiary of what comes next."

Tempo will be able to further bolster the power and improve the efficiency of current AI data centers. The market for such a product is giant; if production is not a limiting factor, I estimate Tempo will be able to generate $600 million in revenue from system sales alone. Cloud access to #AQ64 should generate a similar amount of revenue from enterprise clients interested in solving specific problems."

Look at how far Ionq has come on in this period with huge recent developments with remote entanglement and photonic interconnects and their next phase swapping ion to ion entanglement to QPU&#39;s.   Data centres using current computer tech use massive amounts of electrity. As quantum computers use 95% less is this not a matter of time. There could be a buy out or an amalgamation down the line but either way this stock is at the cutting edge of quantum computing and anyone who is disparaging of it just does not get the pitcure. They have a clear path and vision to scaleability and recent contracts are only the beginning. Yes Ai is fantastic but having Quantum Ai abilities is what the world will be using within 5yrs. This stock may have its bad days but long term it&#39;s a sure case retirement plan for any young investor which sadly I am not. That however is not putting me off buying now if only for my 2 sons to show them how shrewd their Pops really was when they cash out in 30 yrs."

Interesting 3 of the 4 researchers are in China, the fourth from the California Institute of Technology. Study exclusively on IonQ Aria (AQ#25).My favorite part:&#34;Our results establish a noise-robust, unconditional quantum advantage in ML in terms of expressivity, inference speed, and training efficiency, compared to commonly-used classical models. Through numerical and trapped-ion experiments on cloud, we show that this advantage is already evident on a relatively small system size. These features make it a promising candidate to be experimentally demonstrated at scale in the near term, particularly on trapped-ion and neutral atom systemswhere all-to-all connectivity aids entanglement generation. We also pinpoint the origin of this advantage: quantum  entanglement can be utilized to reduce the classical communication of certain ML tasks."

That being said, it&#39;s possible for the two types of computer to communicate and work on the same problem together. That&#39;s where we get the idea of hybrid computing, which is what IonQ is pursuing with their Forte Enterprise and Tempo systems. Those two systems are designed to be integrated seamlessly into existing classical data centers. Dell and NVIDIA are some other large supporters of Quantum Hybrid computing, and IonQ happens to be partnered with them for that purpose.To sum things up, yes, quantum computers can function within data centers, but they do require their own operating system, firmware, software, and some types of networking. They are compatible with our existing internet."

As best as I can decern from published papers it is in the range of 2^17. Quantinuum is 2^21.\n\nIONQ’s Forte Enterprise is 2^36 and Tempo is to be 2^64.\n\nPull out your calculator to appreciate the difference in size of problems each of these companies can compute. IBM is in the range of a toy and IONQ’s Tempo will be greater than the world largest super computer.\n\nI welcome IBM supporters to shed any light on their max USEABLE computational space. It seems like they are pivoting to quantum algorithms as opposed to hardware."

Then the market cap is way more than $2b.If it’s 8.80 in 5 years THEN you can say I told you so…and I’ll wholeheartedly agree. Not today though we’re still early in the game."

One large data center can use tens of megawatts of power. This power draw not only has massive implications on carbon emissions, the cost of this electricity can be millions of dollars per month. It&#39;s so large, in fact, that Microsoft is looking to bring the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island back online, solely to power AI data centers. That&#39;s where quantum comes into play. IonQ&#39;s next generation of quantum computers, called IonQ Tempo, will be the first quantum computer to have a greater computational space than classical computers. This is because its 64 algorithmic qubits give it the ability to consider 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 different possibilities simultaneously. This is a whole order of magnitude greater than the world&#39;s most powerful supercomputer, Frontier. Frontier consumes over 60 MW of power, while Tempo is expected to consume 2-10 KW. That is 1/10,000th of the power draw, with significantly more power. Tempo is projected to be available in 2025, which will be a major inflection point for quantum computing."

As I’ve said before, I’m long since the SPAC and have only ever added (substantially) more and I’ve never felt as confident in my original conviction to buy. It’s difficult not to feel incredibly excited about the prospects this company holds - I truly, truly believe it’s going to be transformative over the next few years.It’s interesting that the amount of spam on this thread has gone through the roof since Fridays jump - IonQ is now suddenly on many more radars - my mute list is getting ever longer. It’s not that I don’t like detractors - I’m ALWAYS interested in an alternative perspective, just as long as it isn’t coming from someone with the mental age of 5-10. I’m a realist in that there’ll be bumps in the road ahead, be those technical development headaches, missed contract dates and short reports/attacks - but these are little more than annoying mosquitoes in the grand scheme. Stay the course, hold fast, ignore the malevolent detractors, listen to the sensible ones. Prior to Friday there were probably no more than 20 regular, well informed posters on this board. WE are in at the bottom of what could become one of the biggest stock market stories of the next two decades. GLTA holders. Paul (UK)"

Posts in the past have had few viewers, likely less than 500.   Friday&#39;s announcement had coverage from many wire outlets.  The x posters have gone from a few to many.   Even the activity on this board has (in some case not a good thing) has increased dramatically.  The situation with the founders leaving starting the last week of September 2023 has been dem--mystified.  IONQ has been validated by selling systems on 2 continents and this networking contract in my estimation is the ultimate validation.  No need to network if there is not something of value to be networked.Chapman was brilliant in releasing the PR at 4AM eastern, 2AM on the west coast on Friday. It brough iternational buyers in, pumping volume by US market opening.  Tomorrow is last day of the quarter. Some fund managers may be scratching their heads today thinking of the brilliance of buying tomorrow.  Will Chapman have another PR soon?  Look at the flow in the first 8 months of 2023.  As far as I am concerned IONQ is debuting on the worldwide stage right now."

If the SP is able to hold these levels, and rise past $11, we&#39;re likely headed to a new high.The fundamentals of the company remain the same, and this contract only confirms them, solidifying IonQ as a real information technology contender and the leader of an emerging industry. We&#39;re potentially only a few months away from news that AQ64 has been achieved. Tempo should sell faster than they&#39;re able to produce it, so it&#39;s a good thing IonQ has the only dedicated quantum manufacturing facility.Excited for the road ahead, a day like this was a long time in the making, cheers to many more."

I find so many similarities between IONQ and RKBL in-terms of the hardships they both had to go through past 2 years. Patience always pays and just like PLTR, RKLB’s move forward to the next phase has just begun. I strongly believe next up is IONQ. Next 12 months we’ll see exponential growth and groundbreaking leaps into the next phase. It’s coming…just be patient."

Its trapped ion competitor Quantinuum has to work around these patents which makes it much more difficult to match IONQ’s scalability.\n\nSuperconducting modality is essentially dead. Evidence of this is IBM partnering with Pascal that uses neutral atoms. Neural atoms seems to be the only other potential path forward that provides patent opportunity in a modality that may have a future if it can solve its 99.5% fidelity issue. \n\nRight now IONQ’s scaleable path has far fewer unknowns than any other company or modality which makes it the leader. I can appreciate things can change, but that is the case for all industries."

The recent breakthrough regards their error correcting code which MSFT say will work on all qubits but so far has been tested on quantum machines from Quantinuum and Atom. The software code provided an improvement in fidelity of x800. It may be that next we here about Microsoft&#39;s error correction code on IONQ.Gate fidelity of 99.99% is not actually useful in a practical sense. It is better than 99.8% for sure but it does not provide sufficient accuracy to solve problems. I explained this point in some detail in my article.Microsoft make available quantum computers from a number of suppliers including IONQ. That is why I consider them the leader not because they have the best qubits but because: 1) they have software that improves the fidelity of qubits to a level never before seen 2) they provide the ability to access the quantum machines of leading suppliers 3) the full stack approach linking AI-High performance computers-supercomputers-error correction-quantum machines on Microsoft Azure is superior to any other.I believe their Quantum Azure platform will become the leading platform for accessing quantum computers, even if those machines are not made by MSFT.As for IONQ, I am not particularly bearish just not yet convinced they can scale to the size of machine needed to make a useful machine. I know they claim 64 qubits will be enough but I am unconvinced."

IonQ achived more than double, 25 useful qubits, two years ago. This achievement from Microsoft happened less than two weeks ago. And these 12 qubits are from a superconducting system, so the coherence time is about 1/1000th that of IonQ&#39;s systems, and I can all but guarantee their gate fidelity is not 99.99%, like IonQ has been able to achieve.

Microsoft is most certainly not ahead of IonQ, in fact, they appear to be about 3-4 years behind. Microsoft&#39;s gate fidelity is much lower than IonQ&#39;s. IBM&#39;s is as well. Gate fidelity is what limits the power of a quantum system, so IonQ&#39;s are by far the most powerful. Not to mention they&#39;re cheaper, easier to integrate, more energy efficient, and presently commercially available."

IONQ’s Tempo will be 2^64 which surpasses the largest super computer in the world (Fortier).\n\nPull out your calculator to fully appreciate the differences in the size of problems these quantum computers can handle.

We are still a risk on investment that many algorithms and investment vehicles can&#39;t touch because it is too speculative. But if the numbers become what we believe they&#39;ll become, eventually all those switch over and we are talking a company worth far more than 1.7b or so. We&#39;re talking 17b, 170b, maybe more in valuation years from now. Or maybe 0 if it all goes south. Either way it&#39;s going to take time! I am excited to hear about what the application revenue stream Peter Chapman plans on introducing at the Q3 earnings call is. He and all the Dell folks around him know how to make money in an enterprise setting. Applications - data center resources - on prem hardware installs...this will be undeniable! Current prices seem like a glitch in the matrix."

That won&#39;t be without strong opposition from the likes of IBM, QuEra, and Quantinuum. However, if IonQ is able to deliver commercial advantage next year, there won&#39;t be much opposition for a while. In 5 years I expect to see about $1.2 Billion in revenue. At current P/S ratio that&#39;s a market cap of about $67 Billion, but I&#39;m not expecting the P/S ratio to remain that high. Still, that&#39;s enough to get added to the S&amp;P 500. I have no doubt the publicity of IonQ will be mainstream, and it&#39;ll be somewhat of an SMCI for a while, before going on to challenge semiconductors."

You&#39;ve got to have a strong stomach.This is not a get rich quick scheme unless you have a lot of capital and are good at riding momentum plays. I&#39;m not very good and don&#39;t have the time for momentum investment. My best investments have been buys where I see a mismatch between current asset value and long term asset price - then it just takes time.I&#39;m of the mind there will not be a prolonged bull run that 3x/5x/8x/13x/21x this until there are quarterly updates that show significant progress towards cash flow positive. Do I think that will eventually happen? I have staked a large investment that it will. Revenue and bookings on quarterly and annual updates so far are on target for a small cap, hypergrowth company in a nascent industry with to be determined market cap potential.I&#39;m bullish on a 3-5+ year horizon. Potentially generational wealth 5-7-10 years out. Just don&#39;t get your hopes up any new longs that this will irrationally zoom overnight. This will rationally zoom once critical mass hits. Which if the trains stay on time, I think will happen."

There are many companies out there pursuing differing methods but IonQ has consistently beaten its predicted timeline for milestone technical achievements. It is selling real systems to real customers. It’s still very early days but they are without doubt laying the foundations to something truly revolutionary. I think one of the major advantages they have is that their computers run at room temperature on just a normal power supply unlike competitors who require huge refrigeration systems to run at near absolute zero. From a cost, simplicity of installation and maintenance point of view, this HAS to be a significant advantage. They’ve already got the attention of the military which is going to be a key customer of Quantum.So how far can they go? Hopefully they’ll mature and continue to produce revolutionary systems and become one of, if not the major player in the industry. I’ve been invested since the SPAC and have only ever added more shares. It’s a risky play - but the stream of news just gets better and better. I think it has the potential to hopefully generate very significant returns over the next 2-5 years.Paul (UK)"

They are facing logarithmic qubit growth to be able to scale. Ionq believes they will achieve logical qubit fidelity on their useable qubits(AQ) in 2025.

We took on a lot of risk by placing our bet on the company to deliver us returns. Some of us may have had unrealistic time-frames in mind. Startup tech companies, especially ones that are doing things that have never been done before, take YEARS to reach profitability. It&#39;s fun and easy to ride the waves of volatility, making money on the uptrends. It&#39;s also psychologically distressing when we see our investment lose value. \n\nThe economic forces that control share prices are larger than any one of us retail investors. Therefore it either takes a massive change in sentiment or corroboration at scale for retail investors to sway a share price. Thus, 99.9% of the price changes are wholly created by money managers and large banks. This is who we call &#34;Wall Street,&#34; I need not explain why. \n\nWall Street as a whole is a momentum player. It is taught in business schools around the world that businesses need to not only have the ability but also the propensity to increase stockholders&#39; equity over time. This requires a historical, consistent, positively growing trend in net income. A company like IonQ that has not yet proven such a trend is possible in a given sector is undesirable to Wall Street. They won&#39;t touch it until it is more guaranteed that it can maximize shareholder value. \n\nAnother important thing to realize is that Wall Street bankers are just like you and I. They have a job, and they earn money from this job, and in the face of limitless scarcity, more money is better to have. The way that money managers make the most cash for themselves is by generating the largest return possible each year. This is the primary reason that IonQ is struggling. It&#39;s not set to generate a net income for at least 2 more years. Therefore there isn&#39;t any real reason for the share price to take off until then, so for now it&#39;s just a risky place to have cash. It may go up, or it may go down. The money managers aren&#39;t willing to take this risk; they want an investment more certain to help bolster their year-end bonuses. So, they take less risk and increase the turnover rate of their portfolios. They ride the upward momentum on exciting industries like AI. \n\nI believe quantum computing will follow in the footsteps of AI, but it&#39;s a waiting game at this point. It&#39;ll take a lot of patience and mental fortitude to get there, but eventually Wall Street will want to ride the momentum of innovation that QC brings. This alone is enough for me to take the risk in hopes of being along for the ride. \n\nAs IonQ&#39;s fundamentals only get better and better, the share price is remaining constant, even struggling to hold previous support levels. If this isn&#39;t the most bullish signal in the world, I don&#39;t know what is. \n\nI hope that answers your question."

Non-albelian Anyons are quasi particles that exist in a two dimensional topological state resistant to the laws of thermodynamics (noise that leads to decoherence) in the three dimensional state. Quantinuum has demonstrated that a trapped ion quantum computer is able to manipulate anyons. So, in short, there may be other future ways to explore topological states but trapped ions will most certainly be one of them. Ionq is relevant now and into the future."

I’m absolutely no expert, but I’m bright enough to see that IonQ are putting together a revolutionary hardware product offering, backed up with software and a nascent corporate structure of experts that, if all goes according to plan, will become a titan in the computing sphere within the next 3-5 years. I’ve been invested since the SPAC and have only ever added. I truly believe (and hope) that for early invested longs this is going to a transformative company both for commerce and investors.The views on the EX posts are minimal which is indicative that most are unaware / ignorant of the implications of Quantum. When this starts to gain traction and attention from the masses as well analysts, the take off will be epic.GLTA to all who are seriously invested - to the shorts you’re going to need a new target soon.Paul (UK)PS. Muting the garbage posters on this forum has also been ‘transformative!’"

I&#39;m confident that this is the best modality, for a number of reasons. I&#39;ll use superconducting qubits as a comparison since they&#39;re the most popular modality. SC computers require entire buildings to be put up, with massive dampeners and cooling loops to help the system operate. IonQ&#39;s Forte Enterprise can be directly integrated into any existing data center. This is currently being done in Basel Switzerland. Back to the cooling, superconducting qubits need to be cooled to near absolute zero to achieve quantum properties. This requires a costly and sensitive liquid helium cooling loop. Trapped Ion systems operate at room temperature since the cooling is done internally by lasers. Superconducting qubits are also very sensitive to vibrations. A researcher walking in proximity to a superconducting system can cause the system to lose coherence and fail whatever operation is being performed. Trapped Ion systems are not nearly as sensitive to vibration, since the ions are suspended in a vacuum and held into place, again by lasers. Then there&#39;s the idea of coherence time: the duration that a quantum computer can focus on any given problem. Superconducting systems&#39; coherence times are measured in the milliseconds; they&#39;re short bursts of coherence, so complex problems are more difficult on those systems. IonQ&#39;s machines have coherence times on the order of 10 minutes. This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for what type of problems can be completed. Then there&#39;s the gate fidelity. Superconducting qubits are asymmetrical; they have different masses and sizes and therefore have greater difficulty communicating, which gives a higher gate fidelity. Think of that like an accuracy rating. SC qubit companies typically state their fidelity in terms of &#34;average two-qubit gate fidelity.&#34; I&#39;ll explain the significance of that in a second. Trapped ion systems typically have much higher fidelity, IonQ has achieved 99.999% with their barium platform on which AQ64 Tempo will be based. IonQ chooses to use &#34;All-to-All gate fidelity&#34; as opposed to average 2-qubit. They believe that all-to-all is a more standardized and useful metric than average 2-qubit, since it accounts for communication between all qubits simultaneously, which is where superconducting modalities lack. Trapped ions&#39; list of advantages goes on, these were just some that I remembered off the top of my head."

Logical vs hopes and dreams is there will be consolidation in the industry and these companies will be bought out or fail as they will need HUGE injections of capital to sustain any growth model and the legacy companies will rein supreme. Access to capital is expensive now. Don&#39;t let these puppets steer you in the wrong direction with their fancy, regurgitated, unoriginal plagiarism anyone can find on the WWW. Good luck!"

The general problems like &#39;simulating nature&#39; are too generic and too vague. When someone says - QC has applications in cybersecurity, drug innovation, financial risk simulations and optimnization of complex tasks with many variables, it goes little bit further. WIth that in mind, can we talk about the folloiwng questions:How big is the industry and how big is the problem for each of these potential solutions?Qbits has 3-4 ways to go about it - superconducting qubits, trapped ion qubits, and photonic qubits. Which one has the most promise...Meaning which one has the best chance of brining the fisrt &#39;real quantum computer&#39;?Which company has the best Operating system and the programming language for Quantum computing? NVDA is dominant in AI space because they have the CUDA to go with their hardware. I want to invest in the company that has both solutions (hardware plus software).Do we see any advantage in having a &#39;hybrid model - Classical computers married with QC capabilities&#39; ? Is that closer than pure QC hardware? I was looking into RGTI and was impressed with their innovation. Any thoghts on that?How far is QC from being &#39;real deal for everyone&#39;? QBits are too difficult to control and they cannot maintain their state for far too long. That is the &#39;generic problem&#39; but any insights on how far out?  Thank you for your time and thoughts."

So $40k worth of GPUs gets the same performance as IonQ Aria. Extrapolating, to get the same performance as Forte Enterprise (assuming 10 qubits increases the computational power by 2^10 or 1024), it would require about 4,000 H100 GPUs. That&#39;s near the upper limit of data center size (10-20k GPUs). Not only would this cost $40 million, which is roughly four times the price of a Forte Enterprise, it would also consume several orders of magnitude more electricity. Forte Enterprise uses, from what I can find, about 2-10 kilowatts of power. This is compared to H100s using a peak draw of 10 kilowatts EACH. So 40 megawatts for a data center that can simulate 35 qubits. \nThis just goes to show how appealing IonQ&#39;s systems are. I have no doubt all five Forte Enterprises will be sold by EoY."

To me any valuation from $1.25-$2 billion for this hardware+OS+application stack providing military grade QPU just seems way off where it&#39;s going.I&#39;m just DCA&#39;ing bi-weekly and hope it will pay off down the road.

At the 36:30 mark, Thiel started talking about atoms and bits. He&#39;s one step away whether he realizes it or not that qubits will advance information and physical sciences the next 30+ years, the way the internet and bits have the last 30. On a walk afterwards, Thiel&#39;s words got me thinking into how applications on top of the hardware will be huge. Those first apps that can be sold to biochemical, pharmaceutical, or adjacent industries is in my hope a large potential revenue stream, and a path of advancement for the physical sciences. That IonQ has a division focused on this led by Dr. Martin Roetteler and Dr. Masako Yamada with 14+ people under their report structure is a strong sign.Writing this, I came upon IonQ&#39;s Application Services website and it&#39;s actually pretty well done if you Bing or DuckDuckGo search it."

Used properly they are a great tool for productivity.  But they lack the simplest real logic and reasoning and it&#39;s not easily fixable.  Automating real human intelligence is a very hard problem.  From the paper: &#34;The original problem formulation, of which we will present various versions in our investigation is as following: &#34;Alice has N brothers and she also has M sisters. How many sisters does Alice’s brother have?&#34;. The problem features a fictional female person (as hinted by the &#34;she&#34; pronoun) called Alice, providing clear statements about her number of brothers and sisters, and asking a clear question to determine the number of sisters a brother of Alice has. The problem has a light quiz style and is arguably no challenge for most adult humans and probably to some extent even not a hard problem to solve via common sense reasoning if posed to children above certain age.&#34;  But LLM&#39;s can&#39;t do it.&#34;Alice in Wonderland: Simple Tasks Showing Complete Reasoning Breakdown in State-Of-the-Art Large Language Models&#34;"

Bookings for the blance of the contract will be recognized in Q3 or Q4 this year assuming the design phase is complete.  Bookings this year may impact revenue this year or in subsequent years depending on when revenue is recognized.  Systems take longer to deliver than design, etc.  As I recall ARLIS also calls for &#34;service&#39; which could involve revenue recognition over several ears.

His firm expects a minimum of .50 points rate cut in September and strongly feels .75 points should also be debated before making the decision. They think the macro market will start to move to the upside and rally at least a couple of months after the elections. This is not news to any of us, but hearing this from a professional made me feel optimistic. I’m sure many of us have seen this in the past; but it seems in 2025, the stars are going to align perfectly for IONQ. With several announcements of ground breaking technological progress and real world applications, IONQ will grow into and beyond it’s valuation and set new highs while inflation settles and the economy improves with positive sentiment.

We continue to increase each paycheck. We have multiple streams of income so that&#39;s at minimum of four times every two weeks. The last freelance income went entirely to the portfolio. I missed 2008/2009 out of fear. I missed 2020 out of fear. I&#39;m living boldly and courageously now. I&#39;m debt free, still live on a &#34;poverty level&#34; budget, and still have plenty padding the emergency fund. I chose the moniker I did for a reason. I will not miss what could possibly be the final chance for me to grow generational wealth in my lifetime. The future is quantum."

That has a lot of implications for the size and complexity of computations the systems can do. Also, qubit count isn&#39;t everything. Gate fidelity sets a limit on the computational capacity of a system, regardless of qubit count. That&#39;s why IonQ uses the #AQ metric, because it standardizes the power of a quantum computer and accounts for the different factors that determine the computational capacity. The reason other companies don&#39;t use #AQ is because they don&#39;t want people to know how much slower their systems are than IonQ. Another advantage that IonQ has is the system&#39;s construction. IBM&#39;s systems require infrastructure that costs hundreds of millions on top of the system cost that is already $50+ million. They also need to be cooled by liquid helium for their synthetic superconducting qubits to obtain quantum properties. IonQ&#39;s systems cost $10 million total, don&#39;t require any changes to infrastructure, and can run at room temperature. Based on that information, it should be clear who number one is. If it&#39;s not clear to you, it&#39;s best to not invest in businesses you don&#39;t fully understand."

The global markets panicking because of the Yen carry trade and looming war doesn&#39;t change my opinion on the value of IonQ over the long run. If you don&#39;t like IonQ and don&#39;t think it has a future - don&#39;t invest. If you do like IonQ and do think it has a future, times like these are great for investing if you have the cash - be it this or any other equity down because of macros that are independent of the performance of the company you are thinking of investing in.
