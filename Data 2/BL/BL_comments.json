You should really be looking at a 40 year time period working years 2565. Regardless, bonds arent supposed to beat stocks over the long term they are there to help stabilize your portfolio during market downturns. Its fine to have an all equity portfolio if youre young because you have time to wait for the market to recover can take 10 years in some cases, but if youre at or near retirement you dont want 40 or more of your portfolios value to be lost in a major stock market downturn, where youll have to sell stocks at the bottom locking in the loss with no opportunity to bounce back to fund your living expenses."

Stocks have also done exceptionally well for decades with only some fizzles. Well some big fizzles like 20072008, but most stock portfolios recovered by 2012 if the investor didnt need to sell to, say, stay retired. When long rates are relatively decent, the idea is higher quality bonds increase when the stock market eventually crashes. So when a 6040 or even 8020 portfolio does well preferably reinvesting the higher interest in more shares in a taxdeferred account, theres enough bond profits to buy more equity shares on the cheap if desired. Theres also the psychological factor to consider, etc.. It also depends on keeping ones job, but if younger theres also time working to ones advantage. If retired or close to it, too much stock wise gets more problematic for most i.e. may want more bonds and even dividend growth stocksfunds which are volatile.. yet less volatile than growth typically. Also bonds do not grow, so if younger the 6040 is probably too conservative even a 2030 target fund of funds I looked at was 5545."

However, challenges in managing cash flow, increasing debt levels, and low liquidity ratios pose risks to the companys financial health. Despite facing operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks, LLY remains a key player in the pharmaceutical industry with opportunities for growth through innovation and expansion. Investors should carefully consider these factors in their investment decisions. Key Financial Insights Strong revenue growth from 24.54 billion in 2020 to 34.12 billion in 2023, representing a 39 increase. Healthy profitability margins with Gross Profit margin at 79.2 and Net Profit Margin at 15.3. Total Assets increasing steadily to 64.01 billion in 2023, reflecting a strong asset base expansion. Focus on revenue diversification, cost optimization, and debt reduction for sustained growth. Operational efficiency improvements and innovation investments are crucial for longterm success. Risk Factors High debt levels with Net Debt growing from 12.94 billion in 2020 to 22.41 billion in 2023. Negative Free Cash Flow in 2023 signaling liquidity challenges. Low liquidity ratios Current Ratio 0.94, Quick Ratio 0.92 indicating potential cash flow constraints. Operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks impacting financial performance. Moderate Value at Risk VaR of 0.45 pointing to a moderate level of risk associated with investing in LLY. Conclusion Given the companys strong revenue growth and profitability trends, coupled with the risks posed by cash flow management and debt levels, investors should exercise caution. A hold recommendation is advisable at this juncture, allowing for further monitoring of operational improvements and debt reduction strategies to better gauge the companys longterm financial stability and growth potential."

Its not the first time people have tried to corner a gemstone market, most fail, government regulated supply is a weak hold and product moves through with the correct connections and money. Blue Zircon can be found in many localities and white zircon can be treated. The price and comparison should also be measured against a basket of similar gem material which you will find a similar trend in pricing that many mid tier gems have moved up in value over the last several years. This last year in Tucson anecdotal discussions with gem dealers and purchasers indicated some level of inverse pricing from mine to consumers, it was more expensive material at the mine source than what was being sold in Tucson, mainly due to cash buyers paying premiums for large lots at the source. The price to reach 10K per carat is unrealistic in a lifetime term. This material is just not that rare to reach high grade ruby and sapphire pricing. if you can get 300 you are good, if you get 500 for high quality large pieces great, but the average is lower and there is a lot of material that is treated flooding the market some show up directly at the mines. A good resource on pricing and markets is GIA field Gemologist Wim Vertriest who has written many articles on sourcing stones and the market in general and has a large focus in SE Asian markets. Separately if you are looking to have large high quality pieces cut please reach out, I have some experience in faceting"

Their hardness is a 6 on a scale of 10, where diamonds are a 10. The reason ppl can wear diamonds on their fingers is bc they dont chip when abused. Theres also the fact that actual big money can just reopen mines at scale if these were to ever actually appreciate substantially in value, which they wont, because they suck as precious stones and dont have any industrial use. No one cares about how old and sparkly they are if they cant be effectively cut into a particular shape because theyre prone to shattering first.. Also, the math isnt even correct. 1m carats at 10ea is 10m, not 250k. Also, current price per carat appears to be nowhere near 150300 after a brief google search. Also, OP appears to be trying to spin this investment failure into an even farther fetched plan by creating a crypto token and tokenizing blue zircon into a realworldasset... but its already a real world asset, just not one that anyone wants. Also, Ill admit I am jealous though of OPs access to mommy and daddys money and his unlimited free time to spend 5 years chasing such a thoroughly halfbaked idea. Well, at least he has an interest in something, honey, thats all we can ask for... sigh This is worse than nanas money going to intel.

He bought the whole lot from us for around 10k dollars. We went back out and mined another 200 or so lbs but when we reached back out the broker told us hed sold roughly 100 lbs of our first find before the market collapsed. Once there was a steady sales stream the interest and bidding wars for these rocks was gone. To this day saffordites sell for pennies an ounce... Thats how we single handedly crashed a rock market."

Ive seen some wild things while traveling in that circle of high end gem and mineral dealing. In Colorado for example, where weed is legal but the banks wont touch it, Ive seen people come in and drop 30k, 50k etc. in cash on a single tourmaline, with the intent to resell it at some point as a way to legitimize their capital. We call them Wookiees because theyre typically very hairy, and dont bathe much. Then theres the oil and gas geologists who have absurd amounts of money but dress like theyre in between hikes. Theres the HealyFealys who believe the crystals have some sort of magical properties. How they pick a rock thatll increase their Luck, or Prosperity, or bolster their love life is anyones guess. Then youve got the standard investors who are looking to diversify their wealth into collectible class assets or Asset Class Collectibles Ive heard both used. Theyre looking for something they can park their money in and resell for a profit later. You also get just collectors. People whose rock collection went way beyond what you could even fathom as a kid picking cool rocks out of a garden bed. Ive seen some specimens change hands for 7 figures or more.

A lot of people say dont recommend emerald for a daily wear ring or engagement ring as can get scratched and damaged. So ..it is more preferred corundum stones and diamond for that. There are also a lot of advancements in synthetic diamonds happening now first mostly yellow, but also blue diamonds might be created. Sapphire the most famous blue stone can already be created synthetically and blue topaz as well is relatively affordable just from natural sources and a fair amount of good color tanzanite floating around. There are some that like collecting niche gemstones but that is a small part of the market compared to the jewelry industry. The name..is also a problem in that it has nothing to do with cubic zirconia, but the name zircon sounds similar so peoples perception it is a synthetic or low cost gemstone. But one of its biggest flaws in use in jewelry is that exposure to UV can turn blue zircon into an unappealing brown. That is the main reason it has not been widely adopted for jewelry. Almost a similar problem to welo opal that turns dull and yellow over time. Apatite...another blue stone that has a lovely shade can also fade and change color with UV exposure."

What your fighting right now is a global move to lab grown stones. You took a huge gamble with your investment and you do have considerable profit even if you liquidate now based on your numbers. I would look to partner with a manufacturer and begin to make peace with your investment. Its easy to get overwhelmed with facts and figures, you did well. You state average cost at 10carat with a current price of 100150carat thats a serious gain. However what your dealing with now is beanie babies in the 90s. Will it skyrocket in the next years and keep adding value or will people just stop caring? I wish you good luck in your future, I am jealous as zircon is a stone Ive not got to add to my collection.

Zircons in general, because of their small Uranium content, are used in Geology to date the rocks they are in using the UPb dating method. So they found some inherited small zircons in an Australian conglomerate that were 4.4 Ga years old. those are neither blue though nor do they have anything to do with OPs zircons. OPs zircons are less than 1 million year old and therefore very young certainly much much younger than any diamonds. In fact, you would never find natural i.e. not heat treated old, gemquality zircons. The radioactive elements in them mainly U and Th decay over time and slowly destroy the crystal lattice. All old zircons will therefore look somewhat eaten up. Blue Zircons are also neither rare nor even natural. The blue color is achieved by heating gemquality zircons which are usually yellow or orange up to about 1000degC. Zircons themselves are not rare at all either, almost every rock has some in them. Even large gemquality specimens are relatively common. Thats why you can get them for literally pennies on the internet."

Using diamond as thats the only other jewellery stone I know that has this value per carat The hardness of zircon is far far less than diamond at c6.5, this is a serious factor in pricing a gemstone. You say that the mines in Cambodia were closing but youve also got Sri Lanka and Australia which have huge reserves of zircon. Which I guess would make up the shortfall from Cambodia? The 10k you mentioned, I assume thats in gem format not rough or facet ready? Honestly theres a tonne here Im struggling with BUT I hope, for your sake, Im completely wrong and it goes to 10k!"

Its not undervalued, it is valued at what the market is willing to pay for it and their plan to artificially drive up demand is laughably unhinged to anyone who understands anything about anything. OP makes it sound like theres only one closed mine in Cambodia, but their own country, Australia, produces like 40 of the worlds supply of blue zircon and its also mined in Sri Lanka and Africa, as well. Zircon itself is a very common mineral, like its everywhere in the Earths crust. Its also a terrible gemstone due to its brittleness and tendency to scratch. Weve also been able to grow and mass produce zirconscubic zirconia in a laboratory setting, which requires no slave labor, for decades now, and its becoming cheaper and more efficient year after year. There are also multiple other gemstones with similar visual qualities that are much more suitable for jewelry applications and are much cheaper, like moissanite and blue topaz. The extra stupid part of this is that there are plenty of gemstonesminerals which actually have the increasing scarcity that OP is looking for. Turquoise is a great example. It is a relatively rare semiprecious gemstone with only a handful of mines producing it in any significant quantity worldwide. Most of what you see labeled as turquoise on the market now is actually cheaper and more common stones marketed as turquoise because of how scarce real turquoise is becoming. Its basically only found in great quantities in the American southwest and the mines in the southwest have been running dry and falling short of demand for quite a while.

The age of other zircons you dont own are as relevant to the value of your zircons as the fact knives being 2.5 million years old affect the value of cutlery at IKEA. Zircon from Ratanakiri Province, northeastern Cambodia, is well known in the gem trade for its vivid blue colour that results from heat treatment. The untreated brown material turns blue under reducing conditions at 9001,000degC. Ratanakiri zircon is characterised by remarkably low contents of trace elements. In particular, the actinides have low concentrations e.g. approximately 120 ppm U and 95 ppm Th. Together with the very young age of the zircon 1 million years Ma... Blue zircons are also heat treated to give them their colour, which greatly diminishes the value of gemstones. Youre better off buying an artificial zircon. Theyre cheaper and more ethical."

You cut De Beers in on it. Limited edition lemon bracelets, yellow diamonds called lemon drops. You get Apple to call their new operating system OSLemon. A little accent over the o. You charge 40 more for organic lemons, 50 more for conflictfree lemons. You pack the Capitol with lemon lobbyists, you get a Kardashian to suck a lemon wedge in a leaked sex tape. Timothee Chalamet wears lemon shoes at Cannes. Get a hashtag campaign. Something isnt cool or tight or awesome, no, its lemon. Did you see that movie? Did you see that concert? It was effing lemon. Billie Eilish, OMG, hashtag... lemon. You get Dr. Oz to recommend four lemons a day and a lemon suppository supplement to get rid of toxins cause theres nothing scarier than toxins. Then you patent the seeds. You write a line of genetic code that makes the lemons look just a little more like tits... and you get a gene patent for the titlemon DNA sequence, you crosspollinate... you get those seeds circulating in the wild, and then you sue the farmer for copyright infringement when that genetic code shows up on their land.

They also have a very brittle tenacity, lower than that of most gemstones. This means their facet edges tend to chip and wear easily. ...However, any zircons in jewelry should be worn carefully to prevent damage. As ring stones, they need protective settings due to their very brittle tenacity. Pendants, brooches, and earrings are safer jewelry choices. Source These things arent replacing diamonds"

I started to find them occasionally, noticed a pattern to their locations and was able to go on Google Earth and map out likely locations.

Lost all his money on gourd futures, stuck with the gourds and tried eating them. Also asked how easy it would be to turn the gourds into flutesinstruments Bought fake Rhodium for 4000, so he couldnt sell it for the profit he thought he was gonna get. Moved to Uruguay to start beekeeping and got in trouble for importing invasive bees. Ran away to Seattle, worked at Trader Joes, stole pancake mix and tried to sell it before getting fired. Moved back to Oklahoma, tried to buy a huge ant farm located in the PNW to use them for random number generation to sell it to companies. Also was wondering if Ants eat gourds because hes apparently growing them now LOL Couldnt afford the trip to get the ant farm normally plus found out it was illegal to transport queen ants across state lines, somehow ended up in Mexico on the way and losing his passport lol. Ended up in Turkey learning how to juggle ice cream. Tried to start Turkish ice cream business in Oklahoma but couldnt afford it, so he attempted to illegally start his business in the Netherlands with no money or work visa. Asked people if the Turkish government would pay for him to spread Turkish culture to other countries through his ice cream business Hes banned from travel in the EU. This is just insane lol Figured this all out with the help of some compilation threads, heres part 3 of it. I found more to the story on my own after that lol"
