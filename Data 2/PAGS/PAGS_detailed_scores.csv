Reddit,2024-10-24,"A day late, but want to point out that the tilt lift configuration of Archer may not end up being ideal. Supernal has moved away from that configuration to 8 tilting rotors, basically a larger Joby, though with rotors that get into body chopping position on the ground, which I think is a terrible idea. Wish has added blades to their rear lift props, which Archer also has seemed to do, and Vertical has 4 blades on the rear props as well. So 4 blade rear lift props tilting front props does seem to be a common configuration, but its higher drag and weight than the originally planned configuration. All tilt like Joby keeps all the rotors in effective use the entire time and reduces loads on the airframe. Thats probably the better configuration. Archer is still a high risk play with extremely low chance of certification in 2025 since they really havent started collecting flight data on a conforming aircraft and only recently even settled on a functional design. What does your thesis look like with a 2027 certification date?",Neutral,0,0.936160683631897,Reply

That would almostDOUBLE it!
