That company has since gone bankrupt. Analysts dont know shit about fuck and throw around numbers all day long. That being said, this is precisely the kind of speculative shit that can rocket on sentiment alone. Ill be watching it and if it starts to look like it wants to get regarded a la ASTS Ill probably take a position for fun."

Supernal has moved away from that configuration to 8 tilting rotors, basically a larger Joby, though with rotors that get into body chopping position on the ground, which I think is a terrible idea. Wish has added blades to their rear lift props, which Archer also has seemed to do, and Vertical has 4 blades on the rear props as well. So 4 blade rear lift props tilting front props does seem to be a common configuration, but its higher drag and weight than the originally planned configuration. All tilt like Joby keeps all the rotors in effective use the entire time and reduces loads on the airframe. Thats probably the better configuration. Archer is still a high risk play with extremely low chance of certification in 2025 since they really havent started collecting flight data on a conforming aircraft and only recently even settled on a functional design. What does your thesis look like with a 2027 certification date?"

So, a PAGS investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects PAGS the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for PAGS. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

The stock also has one of the highest numbers of banks covering it and every single one has a price target significantly above the current price levels.
