Reddit,2024-10-29,"Thats a fair way to look at it. From my perspective, its conservative mgmt that has always beat and raised and outpaced analyst expectations theyve also called out in regards to 26 guidance that it didnt incorporate any new products which theyve had new launches since this guidance was released and will inevitably have more. I also personally disagree that a high growth fintech should be valued as a legacy bank most of which have sub 10 rev growth. If their tech platform really accelerates and gets deals with large financial institutions itll be hard to ignore its part of the valuation delta vs banks. Theyve also leaned into originating for other companies no capital loan origination and loan servicing revenue where they dont take on risk. Its possible that growth completely stagnates in 27 but I dont think itll be that mature of company by then. Right now massive tailwinds for company with interest rate cuts, regulatory changes driving demand for tech platform, significant demand for loans for higher income individuals which is Sofia bread and butter.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"I get it, Tortoise vs Hare. The reason you want to park money into staples is precisely that they have a high likelihood of being around in 40, 60, 80 and 100 years and they are very likely to keep growing the entire time. This is why staples are powerful. For instance, pull up a sector market share chart. If you do that you will notice something interesting. Techs market share has actually gone no where since the late 60s. It peaked in the .com bubble and is again in a slight bubble now, but overall, not changed since then. What has changed is the companies within. Lots of boom and busts and big time consolidation and concentration of value. Staples havent really changed much either in terms of market share but like I try to describe above, its very easy to pick winners from staples precisely because they are not boom and bust. At worst, they get bought out but they will never go obsolete. This low risk characteristic is extremely valuable because even a dummy can pick winner 90 of the time. You cant say that about picking tech or finance or even energy stocks. Are the big tech giants of the 60s still around? Some yes, but mostly no. Are all those popular fracking companies from the 2000s still around? Most went under in the financial crash. And banks are like revolving bankruptcies even if they dont go under entirely.... Folks need to start respecting risk and practice risk mitigation. There is a total disregard for that on this channel in favor of getting rich quick on the next double or 10 bagger. Every portfolio posted is like 90 tech... many are 100 tech... its like everything thinks they will time the market just right to get out at peaks. It wont work.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Thats not at all what i was referring too no tortoise no hare. Simply alpha runway from the point of buying at a good price multiple after an IPO. Buying a long position while the stock is in the money with great prospects. Im in 5 of them right now that i found myself. Its possible because im no genius, but i can read financials, 10ks and have an imagination of the future. New sectors are transforming and popping up. Like i said, im 29. No one in their 20s should be buying coca cola stock if they want to get rich. 10 revenue growth is okay. But is it the best place to park money? Most companies if you are into msrket research and you are decent, will exist in 30,40,50 years. I also didnt say select companies. The nasdaq and schd all have companies that will be around and carry the index overbthat same time horizon versus KO being a single company yet will surpass KO in price appreciation by 5x over 20 years, 10x in 30 years. And you want to throw in risk mitigation. Coca cola will not exist forever. Perhaps that is the best some can do. But i said what i said to have other readers who aspire for more to challenge their approach. Why are we in this game? To make good moves. To make big moves. If youre 6065 and this a simple way to play the game and you cant do research or dont want to consult an FA, sure KO all the way with procter and gamble and the like.",Neutral,0,0.9898391962051392,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Tell me you dont know anything about economics without telling me you dont know anything about economics. Deflation is bad for the economy because it discourages spending, investment, and consumption at the macro level. Sure, deflation would benefit inelastic essentials like food, but in a service based economy that relies heavily on capital investment and consumption, 8 deflation over several years would have disastrous effects. Deflation increases the purchasing power per dollar, which on the surface sounds good until you realize it also means wages will go down. It also discourages investment at all levels since rampant deflation would create a sentiment that its better to hold off since you can get more for your money later on. Why take the risk investing in the market or investing in RD if you could earn 8 just having the money sit in a bank account. High deflation would also decimate people with mortgages or loans since the payments on the loan remain the same while the purchasing power per dollar and their wages would be going down. So their monthly mortgage payments would be going up over time in real terms. High inflation is also bad, but a small amount of inflation like 2 benefits everyone because it means spending and investment is encouraged since money is losing 2 of its value if its doing nothing, and payments on mortgages and loans go down in real terms over long periods.

Reddit,2024-10-09,"Kind of disagree. The consumer is sick of the Starbucks ripoff. Theyre looking for value, not sweet drinks that cost as much as a meal. Id been skeptical that just tweaks could fix that. I do believe making some big and fundamental and newsgenerating changes could fix Starbucks business. I also believe the small tweaks wont do anything. Seeing that 4 point letter from Niccol screams tweaks not true fundamental change. Its as much BS corpospeak as what Laxman was putting out. Empower the barista. Please. Ive read the employeedominated sub, and the theme is theyre sick of being worked to death and it sounds like many dont even like the customers. Understand the market isnt exactly a forensic fix for China. Customers tired of being ripped off dont need to be told the Starbucks story. The name on cups gag is played out. Making Starbucks a community coffeehouse isnt really what consumers want, and isnt necessarily good for the business. They want better value and they want to get in and out quickly. The 25 pop was the market assuming Niccol could make the inandout quickly thing, and the perceived value thing happen. This letter sounds like he doesnt even understand the problem. And the market annointing him as universal problem solving saint may be misguided. Yes, CMG stock had incredible growth and the brand became widely loved... for the first half of his tenure. But the second half is not as pretty. When problems started to appear, he seemed incapable of identifying and addressing them proactively. Chipotle is now widely perceived as being a ripoff and too bland. Bad portion sizes. Skimping on ingredients and quality. He seemed paralyzed and clueless about that. His last big public appearance before abandoning the ship was him goofily claiming the portions were consistent, as big as your head, and that if you ever felt you werent getting value, you should personally try to shame the worker into topping up your plate. Thats out of touch, not problem solving. So a perhaps more sober assessment of Niccol is that he was present while CMG rode the advantage of the stock being pummeled from killing customers with unsafe food, and then when the time came to actually solve problems, he couldnt recognize them let alone solve them. And now hes the one walking into a problemfest at Starbucks. I took my 24 gains and am waiting to see what happens. If I were given that job, instead of issuing that bad, pithy letter, heres what Id do acknowledge the deep problems which are a consumer no longer willing to pay luxury price for sugary milkshakes, employees placed in unfulfilling situations, operational inability to have quick, high volume output. fixes would be in the form of Big Bang changes and candid humility. Look to the dominos model where they apologized and acknowledged cardboard level pizza. Fix the bad, burnt coffee taste perception. look also to McDonalds who knows you have to keep volume going even when consumers are strapped and sick of you, and they do that with inarguably value through literal value menus. Id have some newsgenerating low priced options as a form of Starbucks value menu look also to McDonalds who figured out how to massively pump out drive through where your order is prepared in the time it takes between ordering and paying and pickup window, and then making that parallel with two or more lanes. Id overhaul the operations substantially. Despite what coffeehouse baristas think, efficient machines can make most of a drink just fine. Weve all had delicious mass produced smoothies, Nespressos, etc. Id lean heavy on such automation and preparation to massively ramp up how much and how quickly a location can pump out the drinks, and let the baristas be more of a presentation element. Let them use their time and personalities with the customers instead of tamping away and washing seives in the back. Yes, Id be fine with a scenario where premade or machine made drinks are pumped out under a counter and a charming baritas focus on pretending they made it and making the customer feel happy and that theyve been served quickly. Make it globally known that the long lineups are over and that you can get a plain coffee for 3 from the value menu. this would address both the biggest consumer deterrents plus make life liveable for the baristas. it turns Starbucks back into a perceived affordable treat, an attainable piece of luxury at a good price. Theres more, but you get the point. Sure, theres a halo on Niccol, and a whole ecosystem of Wall Street and financial news media that is invested in claiming Starbucks is great regardless of the truth.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"Because the Fed can only do monetary policy, they cant do anything about the unevenness of the price changes, such as the goods industry being in deflation and housing industry is still in running inflation. The Fed should ask that the government use fiscal policy to do something about the housing shortage, so they can cut rates to help the goods industries. But they probably know that the government doesnt want the price of housing to stop going up. Both liberals and conservatives want housing prices to keep going up. Dont listen to what they say, only look at the results of what they do. If the Federal and state government wanted to do something to make housing affordable, they could enact these four changes to the housing policy Enact incentives for home builders so they can intentionally overbuild even when prices are in decline. Enact incentives for home buyers so then can move to where housing is affordable, safe and insurable. Enact incentives for employers to locate jobs to where housing is affordable, safe and insurable. Enact new taxes to punish employers who dont pay their workers enough to live near where they work. If all four of these changes were made in the housing policy, cities who have codes that prevent home construction would notice that employers and home buyers are leaving the area to buy better affordable housing. Simply if they fail to do new home construction, people would leave in search of affordable housing instead of trying to out compete the rich people and investors and corporations. Also if codes are so lax that new houses are not insurable, not energy efficient, built in unsafe areas or built as sprawl in the middle of nowhere, the builder wouldnt want to build because they wont make money if houses wont sell.

This fact is further backed up when looking at MANUs trading multiples which all are in a fairly reasonable range of 18.0x 13.0x on an Firm Value EBITDA basis and 17.0x 8.0x on a Market Cap OCF basis..... Id argue that Manchester United, like other sports clubs, arent valued, as theres no significant positive free cash flow. Instead, they are being priced. They are in the same group as Pokemon cards, antiques, and art paintings. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Except, the beholders are billionaires, and theyre likely going through a checklist. I think this line of logic is flawed since a weve shown that MANU does consistently generate cash flow no, cash flow accrual income and arent valued based on greaterfool or bag holder theory like noncash yielding investments like Pokemon cards, Beanie Babies, Crypto, etc.....",Neutral,0,0.9998973608016968,Reply

They were lucky to go public at that valuation, but shareholders who piled into that bubble got obliterated. Looking forward, RIVN probably is one of the few smaller companies that went public in 202021 who will get through this period but I dont think thats ultimately as exciting as people think. Too many people still treating the EV theme like its the 202021 bubble and trying to pick the next Tesla. Meanwhile, a number of 202021 EV ipospac names are already 0s some of which are 0s for the second time.

So, can RIVN bounce? Sure. Is it going lower if there was a recession in the next couple years? Absolutely. Do I think it can be one of the few smaller names that ultimately gets through this period? Yes, but I think the market has gone back to the idea that automobiles are not a great business and people keep wanting them to be something they arent.

Reddit,2024-09-27,I do not know much about Rivian.. but as an investor for you to make money they have to sell a lot more vehicles at profit while investing in massive factories and competing with other players Instead I would bet on lithium miners like albamerle or sqm and other lithium lifecycle companies beyond miners. I heard battery might be commoditized .. so maybe battery recycling. Think what changes in the car architecture.. more motors more copper more high voltage electric lines and interconnects .. companies like molex amphenol comes to mind. Then semiconductors that focus on power conversions and controls like nxp infineon renesas will also win irrespective of who sells more EV. Then there are utility companies which should see more demand along with data centers. There is massive work in EV infrastructure and charging but again focus on the vendors and not necessarily blink or charge point. Along with ev.. there will be a shift to automation .. the players making the cameras lidar chips and software would make more profit than waymo Tesla or gm who are competing to bring the vehicles. It doesnt mean that Rivian or Tesla is a bad investment but its no longer a first mover environment... I have no idea of knowing if they will or will not but if I trust that EV is going to be the future.. then I would bet on the supply chain. Solar might be a big winner in EV . Not so much in data center case. Think ancillary issues... Charging time is still a problem... Land is limited... You want chargers in strategic location. Who has land that might become useless with ev chargers.. think the gas stations... So they will transition there with scope of commercial real estate developing. Else the grid will transition to micro grid with battery storage becoming more critical.,Neutral,0,0.9901494979858398,Reply

So realistically, it isnt cutting into their bottom line as much as it sounds because VW still has audi and several other brands that are rebounding the loss from bugatti.

Reddit,2024-09-27,I like Albemarle that is easy.. I think the rest are ok but these are capital intensive companies and many of them dont have great financials or are based in countries with lax rules or risk of nationalization. Also different companies have different price agreements. Lithiums main risk is technological developments that reduce its content in battery. I would also look at catalyst and previous or rare earth metals too. Unfortunately I havent had a chance to do so much research to suggest names at this point. As the saying goes do not trust an internet stranger. If you like the ideas.. do your own research and share your ideas too. Just note I have a very long time window in investing and generally buy a company and dont sell even if it goes through a downturn.. right now I have large losses in Albemarle and SEDG and many solar companies but I hold them.. I believe its gonna be a rough ride but long term people will migrate to solar and now nuclear too. Similarly .. people will transition to EV but its going to take time to do so. You can get many of these companies for cheap now btw.,Negative,-1,0.9573839902877808,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-25,"How about AR mapping overlaid directly on your vision for traffic directions. Like the AR on Google maps but no need to hold your phone up. 95 of my driving is between my workplace, my home, my familys homes, and stores I like. I go out of town and need to GPS to a location maybe once or twice per year, and that involves glancing at my dashboardmounted phone for a singular microsecond about 5 times per hour for the duration of the drive. Automatic text translation just by looking at foreign text. Neat, sounds pretty SciFi. But were already in a world where I can aim my phone at the same text and have it translated in 3 seconds without putting any adspace directly on my eyeballs. Automatic vocal translation. See above.

Print a fk ton of money, tell the people we need to raise interest rates to tame inflation so businesses cant afford loans and families cant afford to refinance their homes. This results in the rich buying homes for a discount and small businesses dying which monopolizes every sector. Because the purchasing power of the dollar plummeted from the printing, companies have to raise their prices and lay people off the regain previous margins. This leads to your money buying fewer goods and you having less to spend because you were laid off. Less spending as a consumer leads to lower margins for companies.

The home Im living in, is made with the great technology of probably earlymid 1800s the house itself is from 1950 maybe 40s out of adobe a clay like material, very good insulator, and apart from repaints and shit doesnt really have any problems thatd require fiddling with the walls. Bricks also tend to not go bad. HOAs are designed to help boost home prices, but thats dumb as shit, if you just buy one and live there till youre old. I guess in this bucket could go the weird thing that some countries do where you buy a home, and its starter home, and replace it later. So, people moving around can and should also put pressure on prices, as everybody wants or need due to loans to sell for profit. From what Ive gathered, fewer homes are being built, and the ones being built, are more expensive ones.

Reddit,2024-09-17,"Has gone largely nowhere since Fall of 2005 and Ive seen more than a couple of discussions about housingland value in the time since. Land inof itself isnt a positive see also TRC. Produce is a commodity and agribusiness like this is inconsistentvolatile. Water rights are a plus. If you have land and you dont have great management and there isnt some sort of end goal to monetize the whole thing, youre going to have a stock that looks like this or TRC is another, similar example. For all the Ackman presentations and various discount to NAV stories about Howard Hughes HHH over the years, its still way under where it was when there was the Baby Buffett Forbes cover story from 2015 about Ackman potentially turning it into his Berkshire. Real estaterelated companies like the above three that are real estate companies with a mix of assets and that arent REITs often have difficulty attracting an audience and for all the look at the land! they continually trade at some degree of a discount. I think Ive read dozens of HHH sum of the parts thesis reports over the years and yet, after all that, it wasnt bought by Brookfield or Blackstone, its Ackman who has been the one buying it up in the last year or so and maybe he eventually does turn it into his Berkshire, but if thats the case the purchase price will still probably be under where it was when that article was written. Nothing against it and hope you do well, but this has basically been volatile within a range for almost 20 years. IMO, that will most likely continue to be the case as a public company they need to look at a sale. As a public company, all of the assets will likely continue to trade at a discount detailed discussion of NAVdiscount here , so best case at this point is a compelling sale to someone else. As that link notes, being a public company the only reason why they became a public company in the first place was because they eventually had enough shareholders to require reporting hasnt really benefitted it much. The CEO who has been the CEO now for 20 years said pretty much the same last year when it was announced that they were looking at strategic alternatives The value the market perceives we have versus what we believe is the intrinsic value theres always been a big difference between those two things, said Harold Edwards, who has been Limoneiras CEO since 2004. The idea is that maybe theres a better way for us to operate. Maybe theres a better ownership structure that isnt public. Maybe its private, or maybe its merging together with another public company. TLDR As a public company, the next 10 years will probably resemble the last 10 years. Its better off as a private company and if they can get a good offer, some of the value that has been discounted in this for eons will be unlocked. That said, the strategic alternative discussion started late last year and has been reflected to some degree in the move that has occurred this year. If a sale doesnt happen, this is going to go lower again.",Positive,1,0.9666227102279663,Reply

ZelleVenmo arent real things here, as they are just essentially loans from banks that cover the processing time of the actual transfers, and from a feasibility standpoint if youre moving around money frequently or in high amounts ZelleVenmo will shut you down real fast or put cooldown periods on your account where you cant use it for a few weeks. Were talking about a few thousand dollars here. And god forbid I need to transfer 6 figures or more not uncommon in real estate. Then Ive got to go into the bank, during banking hours, and show ID. All of this to access and move around my own money. None of which is a problem with crypto, where your own money is actually your own money and you can do what you want with your money instead of what a bank will let you do with your own money.",Neutral,0,0.9998325109481812,Reply

Also, way to ignore every part of the comment except the last clause of the last sentence. I agree that you should drill down into the portfolio of a REIT before investing in it. I do this to come up with estimations of future vacancies. For example, if a major company in the portfolio went through a downsizing andor is still fully remote, I put them at a high probability of not renewing. On the other hand, if the company is stable and has returned to office, then I put a low probability on vacating, and instead project a 20 reduction in FFO upon lease renewal based on the assumption that the lease will be negotiated and concessions would be made.

Reddit,2024-09-16,"Holy ChatGPT If you expect a 25 bps cut and bonds are too expensive Short Bonds Since bonds are overvalued too expensive for a 25 bps rate cut, you could short bonds betting the price will fall. As the market realizes the smaller cut, bond prices could decrease, allowing you to profit from the short position. If you expect a 50 bps cut and bonds are too cheap Buy Bonds Go Long If youre certain that rates will be cut by 50 bps, and bonds are currently undervalued too cheap, bond prices are likely to rise after the announcement. You can go long on bonds, expecting a price increase. Using Leverage Leverage allows you to amplify returns. If youre confident in your prediction, you can use leverage to increase your exposure to the trade. However, keep in mind that leverage also increases the risk of losses if the trade goes against you. For example If you expect a 50 bps rate cut and bonds are undervalued, you could borrow money to buy more bonds than you could with your own capital. When bond prices increase, your returns will be multiplied based on the leverage used. Similarly, if you short bonds expecting a 25 bps cut and prices fall, leverage can increase your profits from the price decline. Risk Considerations Certainty Be cautious about being 100 sure of rate cuts, as central bank decisions can be unpredictable. Misjudging the rate cut could lead to significant losses, especially if using leverage. Market Reactions Sometimes, even when you predict the rate cut correctly, the market may have already priced it in, or there may be other factors influencing bond prices. Always consider these potential risks. By timing your trades based on rate cuts and leveraging your position, you can potentially generate large returns. However, proper risk management and a solid understanding of bond market dynamics are essential.",Neutral,0,0.8301787376403809,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-14,"I challenge your ChatGpT bear post with my bull case gpt post. We can do this all day. The bull case for NVIDIA, despite the potential cracks in the AI scaling hypothesis, remains compelling due to a number of factors 1. AI Beyond Scaling Diversification of Architectures While the scaling hypothesis may face limitations, NVIDIA is not solely reliant on larger models for growth. The shift towards diverse architecturessuch as edge computing, federated learning, and more efficient, adaptable modelsstill heavily depends on advanced hardware. NVIDIAs innovation in custom AI chips and specialized GPUs for varied workloads ensures that it continues to dominate, even as the industry pivots away from pure scale. 2. AI Software Ecosystem NVIDIAs CUDA platform, AI software stack, and Deep Learning SDKs offer essential tools for AI developers. These tools are deeply integrated across the AI research and enterprise ecosystems, which means that even if scaling slows, NVIDIAs software dominance secures its position as a key player. Moreover, AI companies are dependent on NVIDIAs endtoend platform, from training to deployment, and this dependency is unlikely to change even if the emphasis shifts from scale to smarter, more efficient architectures. 3. Enterprise and Data Center Expansion Even beyond researchdriven AI, enterprise adoption of AI is growing rapidly. Companies across industriesfinance, healthcare, and logisticsare integrating AI into their operations, and this trend fuels continued demand for highperformance computing HPC solutions. NVIDIAs foothold in data centers is a major asset, as demand for AIpowered insights and automation continues to grow. The company is positioned to benefit from AIdriven automation, which is expected to scale massively in the next few years. 4. AI in Autonomous Systems NVIDIAs leadership in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other AIdriven automation solutions offers another strong growth avenue. The companys Drive platform for autonomous driving and its investments in industrial robots and AIpowered edge devices place NVIDIA in a favorable position as automation accelerates across multiple industries. 5. Gaming and Virtual Worlds Metaverse While AI remains the main growth driver, NVIDIAs core business in gaming is still robust, and its investment in the metaverseparticularly via its Omniverse platformis positioned for future growth. The convergence of AI, VR, and GPUpowered graphics in virtual worlds will open up new revenue streams, ensuring that NVIDIAs hardware remains in demand across various sectors beyond traditional AI use cases. 6. AI Custom Silicon and Competition NVIDIA is investing heavily in custom silicon AIspecific hardware. The Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchip, alongside nextgen H100 GPUs, cater to evolving needs in AI and HPC. These chips optimize AI workloads and enable costeffective scaling, keeping NVIDIA ahead of competitors like AMD and Intel. 7. AI as a Deflationary Force The massive potential of AI to create efficiencies across industries means that the macroeconomic environment will continue to favor companies like NVIDIA. As AI proves its worth in reducing operational costs, improving supply chains, and automating workflows, NVIDIAs role in supplying the necessary infrastructure will keep demand strong. Conclusion Bull Case for NVDA Despite possible challenges to the scalability hypothesis, NVIDIA remains a key enabler of the AI economy. Its leadership in hardware and software, expansion into new markets like autonomous vehicles, and diverse revenue streams provide a strong foundation for continued growth. Even if the AI bubble bursts in some areas, the underlying technological advancements and enterprise applications are likely to sustain NVIDIAs trajectory.",Positive,2,0.9999943375587463,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-10,"I think the latest report is decent. Revenue has fallen, but profits have increased. 4.2 billion cash, another 400m or so added from the latest 20m share offering. I know some of you probably arent gamers and have never stepped foot into a Gamestop, but Ryan Cohen has really started to turn things around to a once almost bankrupt company. Newer developments would be the Candycon controllers, huge success, they sell out online and in stores almost immediately every restock. I personally have 2, and they are the best controllers Ive used in a long time, high quality. With customizable faceplates, they recently teamed up with Disney to provide limited edition face plates with new game releases. Possibilities are endless when it comes to these. PSA graded sports and trading cards is another huge market they tapped into. eBay literally is selling multiple PSA graded cards every second, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ranging from 15 to 250,000 per card. As a previous eBay buyer and seller, I know the pain when it comes to dealing with eBay and the scammers out there, so that development is looking promising. Just one last thing to add, Ryan Cohen doesnt get paid a salary, nor given stocks or bonuses to work a fulltime job as CEO. He is heavily invested into GME with his own money, so that alone shows that he is 100 dedicated to the company. Do you know of any other CEO who has done this?

Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base.

Ryan Cohen has a proven track record of being a reliable businessmaninvestor, so maybe hell take advantage of the companys massive cash position and start making some real money off investments, essentially turning the company into a SPACBerkshire type holding company.",Positive,1,0.9999946355819702,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-10,"I think the simplest explanation is that Ryan Cohen, like Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn at the moment, is stockpiling cash to earn interest from the current high interest rates, As they seem to believe a stock market crash is imminent. A situation that would make their cash a whole lot more valuable than it already is. I doubt Ryan Cohen sees any value in specifically announcing that as his plan right now. Something else worth noting, which has interestingly been omitted from this post headline is that GameStop posted Its first Q2 profitability, a notoriously bad quarter for the retailer, in years. That was only possible because of the dilution of the float. It wouldnt have been profitable if not for the interest earned on that giant pile of cash. Of course, thats a double edged knife. Declining revenue is not good for a large retailer. Avenues of profitability have to be opened at some point. But at the same time, it proves that GameStop doesnt even need to be profitable in its business dealings to post profits. What an insanely bullish position to be in, when the actual turnaround of the company hasnt even begun yet.",Positive,1,0.8701474070549011,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-10,"How to cheat the market of 20 trillion? Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base. This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that dont exist. Is it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, its true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports Trading 10.7 yy and 43.5 for 2Q24, and for 1H24 11.6 yy and 44.2 for two years further in the sequence shown.

Nvidia locking the software and hardware bundle? Do they expect Nvidia to pour millions in making Cuda work natively across all architectures including competitor ones? Nvidia isnt really preventing competitors to write their own drivers or translation layers for cuda applications in fact, theres two projects for that, ZLUDA and SCALE. The real question here is why competitors havent spent more money for having their hardware make most of the the ML software stack? Like alternative backendslibrariesdrivers for anything from Pandas to whatever. They have slept for a decade while Nvidia was gifting their GPUs to any research laboratory asking for it, it was only natural most of the ML research was built on Nvidias stack. Im not sure whether Nvidia is now cornering customers with monopolistic behavior and I dont fully believe it either. They should obviously leverage their position, but no ones preventing Microsoft from having a huge deal with AMD or Intel and rewriting whatever they need in the stack to work better with that hardware. Nvidia did pull already such shit in the past think of physx and their lame excuse that it could only run on their hardware, when it run on CPUs mostly anyway and some other stuff. But why should they have the incentive on opening their software stack to competitors?

Reddit,2024-09-02,"Gelsinger happened. To be completely fair on Gelsinger though Intel was in a bad spot before he took over. Intel was behind its competition and had inferior products which put them behind. At least though the company was profitable and had decent cash flow. Now it doesnt even have that. When Gelsinger took over in the beginning of 2021 he basically said he wanted Intel to be a company that both designs chips and manufacturers them. He was extremely optimistic to investors about that plan and started making announcements of building big factories in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon, Germany, and other places. In their original forecast in 2021 Intel said that the factories would start being constructed in 2021 and be built in late 2025 and start producing. The main problem came that not even Intel foresaw was a complete earnings collapse. All of the money was basically going to capex to develop these factories and nothing was really going towards their existing products. Intel fell even further behind and their products became more undesirable and competitors moved even further ahead. It came to a point where margins collapsed and they are basically giving away their products for a small to no profit. They also took a massive loss on their chip fab machines cause they were crap so now they have to write them off and buy new ones from ASML. Now cause of the earnings collapse they have even less money to put towards these factories and have to use every financial trick in the book to get money to fund these. One they have been using is debt. Debt has ballooned but you can only take on so much debt. Another is issuing shares. Intel has been issuing shares quite substantially but that will only get you so far especially when your stock is selling off and not desirable as is. Another is selling their ownership stakes in their factories and spinning off other assets. They basically dumped Mobileye and now they want to dump Altera. Construction was also delayed and now Intel is saying that the factories now wont be ready until 2028 at the earliest. That also assumes no more delays. So their financial situation is only getting worse and worse and the fabs are not expected to have results until 20282030. Gelsingers plan only put Intel into an even worse spot then they were already in. Their financials have been the worst in decades, their stock price is at its lowest point in a long time, his promise of having results are looking even more bleak. Its not good.",Negative,-1,0.6132425665855408,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-02,"2021? Intel was in trouble LOOOONG before that. Ive worked in high tech for over two decades now. Theres a long list of examples of Intels own hubris being their downflow Saw 64 bit coming and thought they could partner with Microsoft and force the market to adopt a proprietary standard Itanium. All this did was increase AMD chip sales and accelerate the switch to Linux for servers Thought that mobilelow power computing wasnt important, ignoring it for years before the iphone came out and made them realize maybe they should take it seriously. Then instead of focusing on a low power chip, theyt tried to make some x86 behemouth that no one wanted Saw IOT coming, released a few interesting chips, and completely shat the bed on software support. Getting an OS up and running literally took hours of work and that was just bootstrapping the stupid things. They continued the bs where there all sorts of proprietary hooks so it was damn near impossible to make work with common toolchains. Realized general purpose computing was a dying trend for cloud providers and learned that many were switching to custom IP blocks and other solutions. So, they purchased Altera and then did jack shit with the purchase. A few years later, they sold the company at a loss. Literally screwed over their major cloud partners MUTIPLE TIMES over multiple generations of chips. We had Intel lie to us that they sold a competitor chips with an additional core like we wouldnt find out. We had them lie to us for over a year about a major silent data corruption bug. They famously had numerous security bugs that severely impacted performance and they flat out refused to characterize the performance impacts or let us do the characterization ourself. Created a GPU divisionchip about 10 years after everyone else in the industry realized how important memory bandwidth and high core count architectures would be for cloud computing. When they launched the GPU, they focused on gaming, with no clear advantage in price to compete with AMD or performance to compete with Nvidia. Heres the real issue with Intel. Their leadership is full of perpetual fart smellers. The company is full of people who think they are Gods gift to engineering and if a product isnt successful, its the markets fault for not realizing their genius.",Neutral,0,0.933604896068573,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-02,The main problem came that not even Intel foresaw was a complete earnings collapse.

Intel fell even further behind and their products became more undesirable and competitors moved even further ahead. It came to a point where margins collapsed and they are basically giving away their products for a small to no profit. They also took a massive loss on their chip fab machines cause they were crap so now they have to write them off and buy new ones from ASML. What do you mean?

Supply chain challenges As I mentioned in the post, Blackwell is the most aggressive product roadmap in chip history. And chips are manufactured with a long supply chain with multiple players involved and dependencies in different products. Two products that are acting as the bottleneck right now are CoWoS packaging produced by TSMC and HBM3e memory done by Samsung and SK Hynix. Without this Blackwell chip cannot be produced. If these bottlenecks elevate or are not scaled up soon, NVIDIA would have to lose out on revenue 2. Power infrastructure Blackwell run data centers are power guzzlers. On the demand side hyperscalers, things are still not figured out as to how exactly will this power be supplied at scale. So any misses on power infrastructure build out might cause some risk as well",Negative,-1,0.9999910593032837,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-26,"All of them, really. Whats your reasoning for estimating 200B, going almost 20 above the high estimates from the street? Whats your source for the alledged 105B right now? Fiscal 2024 had DC revenue at 60.9B, the latest 10Q for Q1 had total revenue at 26B. Did you just take that and multiply it by 4? If find your assumption of margin contraction reasonable, but at the same time Im confused by your estimated EPS of 5. Why? Because NVDAs latest 10Q reports a diluted EPS of 5.98 just for a single quarter and a diluted EPS of 11.93 for the full year ending Jan 24. So the current pricing already includes much higher earnings than you anticipate.

Reddit,2024-08-26,"Not saying infinitely but no one knows until a sampling after 23 orders of magnitude yields disappointing results and it would have to be true not just for the algorithm in use, but all possible algorithms. Until that point, people will continue to pay to get access to the next level. Weve barely seen 1 hardware generation so far, and to suggest the nth limit is at 2nd or 3rd generation is... very likely incorrect. Model collapse theory isnt even strong as synthetic data is already useful for distillation at worst, selfplay at best. My thesis for NVDA is very simple Machine learningaccelerated computing MLAC is extraordinarily powerful, more so than anyone thought for the preceding decades before chatGPT the Alexnet surprise was met with criticism of the dataset well before acceptance of the methods, and that is already over a decade ago. MLAC outcomes are directly associated to scale nothing exciting happens at small scales, everything we will ever want is behind scalewalls read Suttons The Bitter Lesson. MLAC infrastructure at SOTA scales is an extraordinarily hard problem from every angle processingdesign, heat, energy, networking, manufacturing, assembly, etc. Those who wish to leverage the capabilities of MLAC and DO NOT want to deal with the infrastructure problem vastly outnumber those who would welcome the challenge basically only Mag7 will consider it, and the markets those who DO NOT want to deal with it are trying to address are essentially infinite cant list and count markets that dont exist and could never exist without the new technological capabilities MLAC unlocks. And NVDA has owned this moment not due to luck at least not due to luck to the extent that those who call them lucky believe Jensen et al have been squarely focused on this no later than alexnet and they used this conviction to spend serious manhoursresources developing for 0billion dollar markets. Cuda, omniverse, isaac lab, drive sim, etc. So when you consider the tangential opportunities this nextgen MLAC is growing towards we can just choose robotics as one example you have all these firms competing at the edge to be the first with the best solution dropin bluecollar replacements as the TAM of these applications is on the order of 100BT, NVDA is the only viable option, with all others requiring further efforts on the enduser that are irrelevant to their problem. Theres a reason pretty much every newly minted robotics firm is using NVDA robotics platforms. This is exactly why Google still buys so much NVDA they are squeezed by their endusers who demand the platforms NVDA has developed as the maturity of the platforms is directly related to the rate of progress they can make. If Google had the same ecosystem around their TPUs I would not be nearly as singularly bullish on NVDA as I am. NVDA is so far ahead here that even their competitor AMD isnt competing with them look at the earnings growth deltas between these two over the last 2 years it is an empircal truth the best kind of truth in MLAC. And for AMD to seriously compete, they would need to operate in a manner antithetical to how they operate read theyd need to spend billions on software development that their earnings cannot support. The reason AMD wins most console bids is the same reason they dont have the ecosystem they are a bargain option for those willing to do more software leg work. And there are a lot more opportunities than LLMs and Robots just try and count them. If matrix math is really the secret sauce here, the winner in the chip space will be whoever has the most plush redcarpet all the way to the endusers.

Reddit,2024-08-26,"You are making an emotional argument without focusing on the facts 1. Return on AI spend is irrelevant to Nvidias valuation since they simply sell hardware to customers. Customers have gone from giving them 16b annually to now 100b annually and then 150b annually next year. Even if capex spending stopped growing next year, Nvidia is looking at 150b per year revenue with 75 margins. Not bad. Btw, this is already being priced in by Wall Street. This year the forecast is 100 year on year growth, dropping to 50 next year, then 15 in 2026. No one is expecting perpetual hyper growth. On the flip side, any growth above expectations would be a tailwind for Nvidia. 2. Big tech are able to afford massive capex on AI because they are insanely profitable. Cutting capex would just go to their bottom line, resulting in a higher dividend, more stock buy backs, or more investment. Not bad either. People keep making circular arguments about Nvidia when their time would be better spent reading the financial statements of the involved principals.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"At lower prices it was an intriguing bet for some investment firms because of the riskreward proposition. The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears.

Reddit,2024-08-22,"Going to redirect to ChatGPT because it will answer the question in far more detail than I ever could The behavior youre describing aligns with what some people refer to as swing trading, which involves holding a stock for a short period days to weeks to capitalize on expected price movements. Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way.",Neutral,0,0.9998124241828918,Reply

Luckily for Snowflake, AWS doesnt have a great product for the largest enterprises to use so the customer would have to switch to GCP or Azure. If youre a global company, I find it unlikely youre successfully running on BQ or Fabric at scale although the technology on both has improved. I read from an insider that Google are actually shifting away from BQ product investments to focus fully on AI which is good for SNOW. Regardless, GCP and Azure are far behind in the cloud race compared to AWS. Completely agree on SBC. Slootman ruined the progress and momentum of the company with this and bad hiring. 10x revenue valuation is tiny in the big dataAI space so I dont get the concern there when they are on the high side of growth rates and customer satisfaction. Also, they havent projected their new product revenue into their guidance yet. This could add an additional 100M to revenue this year.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"Ive been trading OXY since last fall. Buffett likes them and holds 255 million shares. Hes been buying more recently when the price has been in the high 50s. Buffett also has a huge cash pile, so it stands to reason that Buffett will continue to buy more shares if the price drops. That should help create a floor. Today I sold the 57 put with the 823 expiration date. I got 0.37 in premium and the trade lasts one week. So I divide the 0.37 in premium by the 57 strike and I get 0.0065. Then I multiply that by 52, because Im risking the money for one week, and I could do a trade similar to this on this or another company 52 times over the course of a year. And I get an annualized return of 33. Im doing this with one tranche of what Im willing to put into OXY, and I already have three tranches of OXY with a total cost basis of 52.74 per share. This put option reduces my cost basis down to 52.62 per share. If I get assigned the shares at 57 Ill collect the dividend on 910, then sell a covered call at the 57 strike.

I do this on both SPY and TLT. Right now that equates to selling the 540510 put spread on SPY and 9690 put spread on TLT. But what I cant figure out how to do is sell calls consistently for a profit. Being short calls seems to be a losing trade 90 of the time. At the same time Ive come to realize it is the secret sauce to beating SPY returns long term.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Just as a matter of portfolio allocation The first 20 of your bond portfolio should be in long term treasuries Also, should there be a flight to safety for one reason or another, investors should flock to Treasuries in general, usually including long term treasuries, or at least it seems to have been the case during the run into the Covid19 Crash in March 2020, Im sure you can find a chart of around that time you sound like a chart guy. My general thesis is just everyone is wrong about inflation, and we are careening into outright deflation, as a result of the yield curve being inverted for this long, destroying dollars as people pay their debts back, that other people need to pay their debts like a game of musical chairs, and therefore there should be eventually massive defaults and unemployment, and thus deflation. Because The Fed uses the unemployed as a buffer stock unemployment must go up, that is The Feds job. With this much public debt, as interest rates go down, that income that will go away will be bondholders income which will be deflationary, and no one will want to borrow still probably now simply because prices are still just crazy, and we will have to start bailing out entities on the fiscal side, so the trade will go fast. Also The liquidity trap Tldr inflation will probably be a nonissue, although, fiscal policy could really screw things up for this trade, which seems to be the case. The only thing I got lucky on was that I mostly loaded into FRNs as a hedge which seems to have been almost the right move outside of prehaving a bunch of Ibonds back then before moving on it or Id be straight fucked, I was far too early, and really believed they would never actually raise rates, and just keep threatening to lol. But now that rates have gone up, and are now finally coming down, things have only actually gotten crazier and crazier. So who knows. I was also trying to barbell a portfolio of bitcoin and 30 year treasuries to min max returns, they moved far more correlated than I had liked they wound up both going down, though at one point I could have sold my bonds for more than my bitcoins had dropped, I should have just took the 15 arbitrage and left the trade then, Im now down 50 on my TLTBTC trade, at least the gains have outweighed the losses the bonds though, and the interest on my FRNs eclipsed my losses as well as a function of how glacially long this trade has taken, so it still kinda all worked.

I dont quite remember the details on that front though to be honest, it wasnt the primary motivation for the trade, the primary motivation is the monetary system is having a persistently hard time maintaining inflation as a result of being broken in some way I suspect too high global demand for dollars relative to the amount we need to actually print and distribute to satisfy the implications of the Triffin dilemma with our position as the global reserve currency. Allegedly when people short things like TLT, I recall it is actually pretty dangerous Ill try to dig up why. I didnt hear no bell.

It is not natural for short term rates to be above long term rates. what next, short squeeze and quadruple witching on TMF ? I assert, the speculators are those shorting TLT and betting interest rates are going to keep going up in line with The Fed holding up the short end of the curve expecting it to normalize, not me. Long term rates must go down, because the monetary system needs more larger longer loans. Im probably not wrong overall, the market is just more irrational and likely more fraudulent than most people expect. Im betting I can stay liquid longer than the market can remain irrational. Shit, Ill sell some FRNs and buy more TLT. My average price is currently only 114.17, I can get it down really easily here. Just another 1000 shares will put it down to 106.79, 5000 would bring me down to 98.40, those are exitable, especially when investors realize how fucked shit is, it is only a matter of time, and it isnt exactly the sort of trade you can chase when it happens. You have to already have the position. Slap those badboys together, and swap them to percent change from a year ago. It wouldnt surprise me if long term rates went to 0 is all Im saying, and neither should you be, it should unwind those who were holding onto cheap mortgages increasing supply of housing although, if it gets as bad as I think, no one is going to want to borrow anyways to relieve those trying to in mass sell, for obvious reasons. They have to go low enough to get people to borrow and spend in a big way, and they have to go much much lower, lower than they were previously to accomplish that I hope.

Trust me I want what youre saying to be right, it would make my life a hell of a lot easier. I understand that I may be able to open a US brokerage account and never get into trouble, but the issue is it would technically be an illegal account. Its different when people live and open accounts in the US and move over here. I actually asked about this exact topic on the US Expat Taxes subreddit because my initial plan was to go 100 into total world stock ETF on a US account, here are some of the responses I got Doing this could violate the brokerages terms of service. Under U.S. securities laws, such as Rule 10b5, providing false information or omitting material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of securities is considered fraud and can lead to legal claims and penalties. As a practical matter I cant imagine anyone would actually care. If you claim to be a resident to the brokerage firm and then claim otherwise for tax purposes, that could certainly look sketchy. You will be asked for your residence address for kyc know your client purposes. If you lie and use a friends address, and the back finds out they will close your account. They will likely also close the account of everyone else at that address. Theres no recourse for this courts have held that a bank has a right to refuse business. Dont do it .. youll put everybody in a bad situation. So, Im sure practically Id be fine doing this, but I feel extremely uneasy about putting all of my savings into a sketchy account and Id forever be worried about the IRS coming to charge me penalty fees for things I dont understand. But I do really appreciate your help, and honestly opening a US brokerage account is still one of my top options.

Reddit,2024-10-05,"Its a nice thought experiment, but youre taking it too far in your conclusions. Assumptions like management will always spend money in good faith to maximize earnings are useful if you want to make a world that is spreadsheetcompatible, but massively off the mark from the real world. In the real world management has incentives like getting the stock price to a certain number by a certain time to get a payout, future be damned. Creating unrealistic narratives about future earning to justify or increase PE ratios you know are excessive. Tech is a huge part of the SP500 and these problems are very common in tech. Around the dotcom crash this all got so bad that nobody could give out any dividends at all, for fear of demonstrating that they dont have endless golden geese lined up that the money would be better spent on. These days theyve gotten a little better about this and your Apple, Microsoft, and Google at least pay out a nominal dividend of like 0.51. Investors regularly get their money pissed up the wall like this in tech, when they would have been much better off just receiving it as a dividend than having tens of billions wasted on the metaverse with promises that all life would revolve around this concept in a few years, only to have them say actually never mind its all fake after a few years of stock options vesting at high valuations. Of course, were in the middle of a similar bubble with AI, so this all seems quaint now, but trust me, in a few years there will be a lot of people saying I wish they had just given me the money. So yeah, I like a small dividend, just to maintain a culture that this is my money they are playing with, and if they dont have a good use for it then Ill take it. A lot of this applies to share buybacks as well, although theyre prone to more bad incentives as they work through share price, so management is incentivized to do them even when the stock is already overvalued, and the personal incentives mentioned above etc.",Neutral,0,0.9066181778907776,Reply

Looking further back Enron was seen as a great investment until it was people discovered that the executives lied about the companies performance and illegally manipulated energy prices in california. A tariff war was initiated by US government in 1929 resulted in in an about 60 drop in trade and the SP500 loosing 13 of it value in about 2 days. Add in WW2 and the economy needed 14 years to recover. That one assumption in the theory make it it invalid. Things beyond the control of the company can quickly turn it from profitable to a money looser and eventually kill the company. Look at the dividend return and capital gains earnings of the SP500 seperately 74 of of the funds performance comes from reinvesting the dividends Only 26 came from capital gains.

During your accumulation phase you would be wrong to have any allocation other than a diversified portfolio that is spread between growth and value with some adjustment for whether we are in a Value or a Growth phase in the market. In the Early Accumulation phase you should be heavily invested in equities as you dont much care about down cycles as you have little money at risk. In the late accumulation phase you start to build in a strategy for up and down markets as you now have some principal to protect. In the Preretirement stage you start to worry more about beta and less about alpha particularly if you have done a good job of accumulation. In Retirement your goals are preservation and income, so less beta is more important than excess alpha unless you are late to the party. Assuming you have hit your goals, then joining rdividend and forgetting a growth allocation makes total sense.

Reddit,2024-10-05,"Well first they are just much safer, dividend stock are still pretty risky , the dividend can be cut or the companies themselves can go bankruipt or cut the dividend GE is my prime example for years everyone loved the stock as it paid out 6 dividends and everyone said Share price is irrelevant just collect thos sweet dividends because the share price had been flat or falling for years Then they cut the dividend . With a bond they cannot exactly just cut the interest that would require a default, that means the company goes bankruipt . A company can cut or reduce the dividend at any time. So they are just much safer in general . Second bonds tend to rise in value when we hit a recession because usually in a recession the Federal reserve bank lowers interest rates, when rates go lower bond prices rise So in a recession stocks tend to go down, but bond holdings tend to appreciate helping offset your stock losses Dividend stocks tend to fall with the market, they may not fall as much but they still are highly correlated with the market , in the covid crash SCHD fell 31 in a month , VOO fell about 32 so you can see its not even that much safer In the initial panic BND bond fund only fell like 4",Neutral,0,0.8288984894752502,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-05,"Correct. The most common way a lender will look at the quantum of debt they are willing to extend is a multiple on cash flow. So if you generate 100m in cash flow a year, a lender will most likely be willing to extend 300 400m or 3 to 4x cash flow. The primary reason being is a company will trade at some much higher multiple say 7 to 20 times depending on business so if youre only lent 3 to 4, you are safely inside a potential EV of the company. Secondarily, the lender wants to ensure you generate enough cash flow to cover the interest expense of the debt.

Reddit,2024-10-05,"If your goal is to make 200K per year your business will need to gross about 2 Mil. Its pretty typical that a good solid business gives you about a 10 net profit. Ideally you would be one of the key personal and make a salary along with that. It sounds like you have some good skills maybe use some of the 100K to take some business classes so you can learn the basics of what is needed to operate a successful business. Personally I have always worked for myself and never had an employer, but not everyone is okay having that level of risk. The best advice is to start up a small business on the side and transition to doing it full time when you no longer have the ability to work both your other job and run your business.

I dont know the teachingeducation world, but maybe you can upskill there? To become higher earners? Teaching different subjects? Principal? Teach summer school? Im in tech, and if I ever wanted to earn more money, the easiest approach is often learn new skills and leverage that for more money. In tech you can often find higher pay jobs by switching employers comes with proscons who are willing to pay more for your time. Good investments help, but 100K in anything safeish isnt going to say half your time to retirement or anything dramatic like that. You could run a business, but if you werent considering this beforehand receiving your inheritance, how is 100k going to make it any easier or you any more likely to succeed?

Reddit,2024-10-05,"Wanted to chime in here and say that you should back yourself if you land on a solid idea which youve thought out well and truly believe in. Like with any investment, you have to accept the risk associated with it. Could you potentially start again from square one if you lose whatever money you invest? If the answer is no, shelf the business venture for the time being. If the answer is yes, then I have a success story to keep you inspired... My uncle moved to Hong Kong when he was 20 during national military service. He moved from a rural village in France with virtually no practical experience in business. Irrespective of this, he started his first business and worked super hard and really believed in his vision, despite being broke for a long time. He failed many times. His relentlessness is something that should be studied. Anyway, one of his ideas paid off and he became the richest French man in Hong Kong back in the mid 2000s. Its absolutely doable. Of course there is a massive amount of luck involved. And I wont quibble with anyone that addresses the fact we live in a different time now, however starting a business and being successful can without a doubt allow you to achieve your dreams. One thing I will say your dream has to be to run a successful business, not just to get rich quick and chill. I spent some time working for him as a kid and observed some of his business practices. The key ones were 1. Take small steps. Seems painfully simple but this is often something people forget to do. They get over excited with an idea and allow themselves to make silly, costly errors. These errors can really take the wind out of your sails and sales. 2. It all comes down to your margins. To be successful every dollar has to be accounted for. Eking out every cent you can in areas which seem frivolous may make all the difference later on. Not putting the hard graft in now will always cost you somewhere down the line. 3. Be lucky! A lot of what running a successful business comes down to is hard work. Its also important to be clever with how you manage several overarching areas of your business e.g funding, costing, manufacturing, if required, marketing, sales etc. But sometimes it does just come down to being in the right place at the right time. Like with my uncle, he was in the right place at the right time and it paid off massively. Of course he might argue he was there by design, so maybe its more in our power than we realise . The trick to this is to always be in a position to take an opportunity in business if it presents itself. To achieve this, you must live and breathe your business. Know your shit and try not to get scammed too many times when starting out trust your gut, youll soon realise if you have the stomach for business or not. This is all anecdotal, of course its not proof that anyone will certainly make it. Its simply a reminder that running a successful business makes it possible. Either way, dont half shoot it.

Reddit,2024-10-04,"Theres a lot of private REIT offerings that often label themselves as some variation of a unique opportunity previously only available to rich people! But they generally wind up being worse than a REIT and also more complex to own, are illiquid entirely illiquid or limited opportunities to sell and some in the past have gated withdrawals for temporary periods. This seems like it framed itself differently but seems very gimmicky in terms of the kind of things you got and has the same core issues limited liquidity, etc. Never heard of the company mentioned but crowdfunding, EREITs which feel like what were previously nontraded REITs an asset class that lead to a lot of complaints over the years in a different wrapper, stuff like that I just really dont recommend. Edit The site is kind of underwhelming. It focuses on the message which is nice but who is running the operation and what is their background? I see some people listed but no biographybackground. It shows the number of properties it owns in Atlanta but no examples that I can see. Apparently this is some sort of RegA nontraded REIT theres just very little information from an investment standpoint on the website, which is focused entirely on the message really. Id have to really go through filings to try to have a better understanding of the investment yes the message is nice but what do these houses look like? who is running this and what kind of qualifications do they have? the CEO of this was apparently previously CEO of some sort of automotive company?, which imo shouldnt have to be done. What are the specifics of withdrawals, given limited liquidity? Is there the ability to gate withdrawals? It doesnt really say on the website. Looking at one of the filing offerings, theres a long list of risks including our manager and its affiliates have no prior experience managing a portfolio of assets to comply with REIT requirements and detailed conflicts of interest between the manager and the sponsor. Edit finally found it after looking through filings. They intend to limit the number of units to be able to be redeemed during any calendar year to 5 of the weighted average number of units outstanding during the prior year. The manager can gate withdrawals at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason. Theres a lot of other specifics, but its like all the other nontraded REITs yes there is quarterly liquidity, but not if a lot of people try to redeem at once. Again, not really familiar with this beyond just starting to look through filings, but I just think that anything investmentwise needs to have more information than this does on its website. These kinds of offerings sell themselves very basically on their websites but imo theres a lot more to it I mean, just looking at one of the offering filings its nearly 100 pages and theres a lot of noteworthy thingsrisksconsiderations on these filings that should be under an FAQ section on the website itself, not something that people have to go through a filing to find when considering this sort of investment.",Neutral,0,0.9998051524162292,Reply

Since you will have enough for your own retirement dont draw from the Roth IRA. Just let it keep growing tax free from the point of contribution. There are no minimum required distributions even when you are well into retirement age so it can keep growing. When either spouse passes it goes to the other but let it keep going. Finally when the last spouse passes the kids can inherit it.... AND THEN they can let it keep growing tax free for another 10 years.

Reddit,2024-09-18,"I would definitely contact a trust and estates attorney. You do not want to hand the keys to the kingdom to young adults. That doesnt mean you cant help them get on their feet. I assume youre already using a 529. That provides you with tax benefits. If youre saving for college anyway why not? They are young enough that it would provide you with tax benefits on the capital gains. I would put in at least as much as the state tax benefits give you. You could open a custodial account for their gifts. Whenever a grandparent or friends give them cash, you can put some away. After a while their account will grow and it teaches them the value of saving a part of their gift. You could also gift to a trust. This is where the estate attorney comes in. Im not sure what trust type is best for your family. Maybe a grantor trust. In any case whatever you gift them is out of your estate. In 2026, the lifetime exemptions change and will most likely be halved unless congress does something.

Reddit,2024-08-20,"I think the people who are worried the most about overlap are those who believe in market efficiency and therefore like to have their investment spread out weighted by market capitalization. If everything is valued perfectly fairly, AKA if the market is perfectly efficient, then the best investment is going to be a total market index fund weighted by market capitalization. When people deviate this by overweighting certain funds, sectors, or stocks, basically what theyre doing is betting that they see a market inefficiency where others do not. Theyre betting that their decision will help them outperform the total market index fund basically. So if you have a specific reason to think that something is undervalued and you know something that other people dont, then thats the nature of stock picking. Most people suggest against it though, since they say statistically most people suck at it. A large part of investment is measuring potential risk, which can be difficult. Lets take as an example the total stock market index versus the SP 500 index. The total stock market index has an 80 overlap with the SP 500, because the SP 500 is the top 80 of the total market. That means that if you invested half in a total market and half in the SP 500, you would be overweighting the top 80 of the market. This actually slightly reduces the diversification of your investment, theoretically introducing uncompensated risk.",Neutral,0,0.9985913634300232,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-17,"Risk is defined as exposure to volatility The value of bonds are sufficiently uncorrelated to the performance of the stock market. Both of these assumptions, common in academic finance, fail to a meaningful extent in practical reality. Volatility is not risk. Risk is likelihood of permanent capital impairment, which prevents you from achieving your goals. Path dependency on the way to an outcome is irrelevant if you have no liquidity needs and your assets are not going to get wiped out to 0. Over a 2030 year period, who cares if I experience more volatility if Im compounding at 10? Id argue volatility is the price of achieving excess returns and should be welcomed, not viewed as some proxy of risk and thus minimized. As for the correlation point, this is both less true than often stated just observe crisis periods when correlations go to 1.0 and, for the needs of long term investors, not very relevant for the same path dependency reason cited above.

The information is still valuable in that it provides information on how volatility is not directly linked to expected return and that balancing a portfolio in different ways can allow for similar returns with less volatility exposure. This is a good thing to understand. The trade off of increasing expected return in exchange for volatility exposure is not always 11. The point is not to minimize exposure to volatility completely, or even to maximize return vs exposure to volatility. It is to find out how to minimize your exposure to volatility given a desired expected return, and the mechanisms with which people do that.

Reddit,2024-08-15,"I think the whole Quantum Cryptography is a bit of a furphy to be honest. Classical cryptographic methods work well, and we have alternative classical methods for those that could be broken by a general purpose QC eg those based on Prime numbers. IMHO the interesting application is Quantum Annealing. Global solvers are useful in pretty much every industry you can think of. So Im tempted by firms like Dwave NASDAQQBTS. However, Dwaves current tech only solves a very specific subset of objective functions quadratic forms over binary variables, and further, theyve only got about 5000 qubits at this point, so they have not yet reached the scale where they can offer something that a Classical computer can not. So the price could go down quite a bit before going up, and if some other player has breakthrough, then it might never go up. I guess an ETF isnt a bad idea if you want exposure to the sector, because IMHO it is difficult at this stage to pick who will be the winners and the losers. If eg latest crop large language models started using an architecture that could be phrased as quadratic forms over binary variables, then Id be buying Dwave in a heartbeat, but as it stands, I still havent seen that killer application to warrant a purchase.",Neutral,0,0.9998352527618408,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,"I cant provide any advice on sector analysis but I have done some work on using economic data for recession nowcasting to estimate the probability of current recession state. Here are a handful of links I found helpful investingforaliving.us20170616mappingthetopeconomicindicatorsjune2017 I used Python and the FRED API to pull and analyze data, fit classification models and evaluate which data provided most accurate recession predictions. In the end I used individual logistic regression models on each economic data signal, then aggregated the individual model output into a ensemble logistic regression model for an overall prediction of current recession probability. Logistic regression models have a naturally probabilistic output signal and you can shrink the coefficients of the model to make it less certain to reduce impact of overfitting. One of the biggest hurdles in this kind of modeling is that data publication is significantly lagged and that initial data releases are often revised multiple times up to a year after initial publication. But you can access original release dates and original release data using ALFRED through the FRED API and run historical backtests with actual publication lag and data in the state of revision that would have been actually known at the time. Also, you have to be extra careful with how some data is recorded by FRED. For example, Q1 data is often recorded with a date of January 1 start of Q1 but is actually published weeks or months after the end of the first quarter AprJune. If you use the dates as is without adjusting for actually publication date you are essentially peaking into the future by 36 months. You can build a model that seems to work really, really well in backtest but in reality you would need a time machine for it to work in realtime. My model uses the following data series UNRATE, ICSA, CCSA, PAYEMS, USCONS, RRSFS, CSCICP03USM665S, IPDCONGD, INDPRO, GACDFSA066MSFRBPHI,AWHMAN, HTRUCKSSAAR,PERMIT, MSACSR, HOUST, T10Y3M, T10Y2Y, NFCI, ANFCI, NFCICREDIT, NFCIRISK, NFCINONFINLEVERAGE, SP500.",Neutral,0,0.9999868869781494,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-29,"AMDs Q3 earnings report on October 29th is highly anticipated, with analysts projecting a 30 yearoveryear EPS increase to 0.91 and revenues of 6.71 billion up 15.7. This report is crucial for gauging AI demand, especially as AMD competes with Nvidia in the GPU market. Key highlights include expectations of record data center revenue at 3.52 billion, bolstered by demand for AMDs Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. The recent launch of the Instinct MI325X AI chip adds further interest. Goldman Sachs notes sustained growth in AI infrastructure spending and a significant rise in AMDs server CPU market share, now at 34.

Reddit,2024-10-29,"I like them because, they are by far the best company in their segment with global presence. Well run, shareholder orientated, have great risk management and tech to back them up etc. Theyre also growing quite well geographically. However, so far this business lives and dies by the interest rates, the vast majority of their incomeprofits come from interest, they stand to lose approx. 350 million per 1 decrease in interest. They would need to massively compensate for the projected decrease in interest rate with commission fees. And I dont think they can grow fast enough in the short term to compensate. Maybe the boost from elections will help in the very short term but I think IBKR is better held for a long time, and I would enter at approx 100 , current price point is too high for me.

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Why are you OK with this Shares of Vans and The North Face owner VF Corporation slid Monday as JPMorgan put the apparel giant on its Negative Catalyst Watch list. JPMorgan analysts told clients after field work and discussions with management, they cut their estimate for VFs fiscal 2025 earnings per share. The analysts pointed to wholesale challenges with The North Face, and ongoing traffic headwinds across brands. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients that after recent fieldwork and management access, they cut their fiscal 2025 earnings per share EPS estimate to 65 cents, which they noted was 35 below the Wall Street consensus. The analysts based that on an 8 yearoveryear decline in revenue, also worse than consensus forecasts. Ill add that Im not saying just because JPM says its bad, its bad. But wanted to get your take on why its not bad. Why not just wait till after Q2 print to buy to see where things shake out. How did you get comfortable. Ive also been watching this same stock for a year now.",Negative,-1,0.9999943971633911,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Summary V.F. Corp has experienced fluctuations in its financial performance over the past four fiscal years, showing growth in revenue but facing challenges with declining net income. The companys EBITDA and operating income have varied significantly, while balance sheet metrics have seen declines. Margins and ratios have been mixed, with a notable drop in net profit margin. VFC has faced both positive and negative news in the market and is exposed to diverse risks across operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG factors. Key Financial Insights Revenue increased from 9.24 billion in 2020 to 11.61 billion in 2023 but declined to 10.45 billion in 2024. Net income dropped significantly from positive figures to a loss of 968.88 million in 2024. Gross profit margins remained stable, ranging from 41 to 52. Positive free cash flow in most years, except for 2023. Historical volatility of 58 indicates moderate stock price volatility compared to the market. Risk Factors Operational risks from supply chain disruptions and quality control issues. Regulatory risks related to trade policies, labor regulations, and environmental standards. Macroeconomic risks including economic downturns, currency fluctuations, and inflation. Competitive risks due to industry competition and evolving consumer preferences. Technological risks from cybersecurity threats and the need for digital investments. ESG risks impacting brand reputation and consumer perception. Conclusion Given the mixed financial performance, market sentiments, and diverse risks facing V.F. Corp, it is recommended to hold the stock for now. Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports, risk management strategies, and industry trends before making any significant buying or selling decisions.",Negative,-1,0.9561613202095032,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Because there are way more positive catalysts than this single negative catalyst. I agree that TNF is currently the revenue driver hence this delayed winter in the States could affect sales. But keep in mind 60 of the sales comes from Europe Asia. Only 40 of it comes from the US. One thing this analyst Matthew Boss didnt add in his thesis is the thriving backpacks business of TNF, this and international sales would likely offset the decline in the US. One more thing is that the CEO has already guided TNF revenue downwards for the coming quarter last earnings call. The stock also has retraced since this negative catalyst watch, so you could argue it is priced in. The problem with holding off the purchase because of this one negative catalyst is that when all the other brands show signs of turning Vans, Timbs, Dickies of which the latter two and he announces two more brand sales Jansport Kipling and completely brings us back to optimal capital structure, we would be off to the races, being potentially valued at 1x PS which would be 10B in market cap.",Negative,-1,0.998784601688385,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Summary Eli Lilly LLY has exhibited robust revenue growth and profitability over the past four years, with Total Revenue and Operating Income showing consistent upward trends. However, challenges in managing cash flow, increasing debt levels, and low liquidity ratios pose risks to the companys financial health. Despite facing operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks, LLY remains a key player in the pharmaceutical industry with opportunities for growth through innovation and expansion. Investors should carefully consider these factors in their investment decisions. Key Financial Insights Strong revenue growth from 24.54 billion in 2020 to 34.12 billion in 2023, representing a 39 increase. Healthy profitability margins with Gross Profit margin at 79.2 and Net Profit Margin at 15.3. Total Assets increasing steadily to 64.01 billion in 2023, reflecting a strong asset base expansion. Focus on revenue diversification, cost optimization, and debt reduction for sustained growth. Operational efficiency improvements and innovation investments are crucial for longterm success. Risk Factors High debt levels with Net Debt growing from 12.94 billion in 2020 to 22.41 billion in 2023. Negative Free Cash Flow in 2023 signaling liquidity challenges. Low liquidity ratios Current Ratio 0.94, Quick Ratio 0.92 indicating potential cash flow constraints. Operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks impacting financial performance. Moderate Value at Risk VaR of 0.45 pointing to a moderate level of risk associated with investing in LLY. Conclusion Given the companys strong revenue growth and profitability trends, coupled with the risks posed by cash flow management and debt levels, investors should exercise caution. A hold recommendation is advisable at this juncture, allowing for further monitoring of operational improvements and debt reduction strategies to better gauge the companys longterm financial stability and growth potential.",Positive,1,0.9999997615814209,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"I was a scientist in the nuclear industry in the 80s and 90s, its going to be a decade before I retire. Ive worked on reactors, reprocessing and warhead production. In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is.

That was V C Summer 23, another pair of AP1000s. Westinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt. Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK. Among nonauthoritarian countries in the last couple of decades, only South Korea has managed to build large nuclear reactors on a reasonable budget and schedule.

So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid i.e. majority of energy demand then large reactors are the way to go. The actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 57 data centers of 5 GW power each.

Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs.

I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price.

Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different.

I did learn in further reading after this comment though that Westinghouse revenue will no longer include construction work, as some press releases I read excluded that from their business model when discussing the CCJBEPC acquisition. I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"Intrinsic Value Silver, like gold, has been used as a store of value for centuries. Its a tangible asset, meaning it has physical presence and cannot be easily devalued like fiat currencies. People trust precious metals during times of financial instability because they retain value over time. Hedge Against Inflation Historically, silver has acted as a hedge against inflation. When the value of paper currency decreases due to inflation, the price of silver typically rises. This is because silver, like gold, tends to hold its value as fiat currencies lose purchasing power. Industrial and SafeHaven Demand Unlike gold, silver has significant industrial demand. Its used in electronics, solar panels, medical devices, and other applications. This dual demand as an industrial and investment metal creates a unique dynamic where silver benefits both from market speculation and physical demand, making it more resilient. Historical Precedent During past economic crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis, silver and gold prices surged as investors sought out these assets to protect their wealth from collapsing stock markets and devaluing currencies.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"There is a lot of talk about lead and aluminium these days but I am not very familiar with the markets and they do appear to be extremely volatile right now. Especially Aluminium that is influenced by its industry uses growing due to on going wars, weapons, vehicles, missiles, etc. however also influenced greatly by energy prices as the smelting process is very energy intensive. Lower than usual energy prices this year means its cheaper to make increasing demand volatility. Personally I would stick to silver and gold long term as they have historical statistical backing and I would buy aluminium and lead at extreme lows watch RSI and dont hold them for long. Edit The reason I choose silver over gold right now is because it is extremely undervalued in comparison.

Reddit,2024-10-17,"I love SiC and WOLF, but I think the target within the next 612 months is a little high. Instead, I think 2030 is more reasonable. They basically doubled in the last week due to chips funding, but they need to execute. Execution primarily involves filling more orders and reducing CapEx, which they seem set up fairly well to do based on recent transcripts Ive readlistened to. They will have slightly higher manufacturing capabilities at the Mohawk Valley fab than they initially predicted. Overall, I like WOLF because they are the most experienced when it comes to making wafers of size. They are currently transitioning their wafer production from 150 to 200 mm, which is a great sign. On a more qualitative note, when I watch their YouTube podcasts, I feel that they get into the depths of the technology which I appreciate because to me, it shows that the scientists and engineers are leading the company. Other companies will for sure offer SiC in the future, but will they have the highest market share, Im not sure. WOLF is primarily focused on making the wafers, while sum companies focus on wafer production and device development. Only time will tell of course, my recommendation is to look into the tech and prepare for a moderately bumpy ride.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"Guys, if you are new to this sector, please read this message as a bit of advice from someone who has been in this investment since 2019. It is a volatile sector. Expect big drops of 20 in mid cap stocks and even more in small caps. Within a week. This happens also for the upside like we see this month for a lot of the U equities. That said, there is unbelievable valuation and immense upside to many uranium juniors and business focused on the fuel cycle enrichment etc. This sector moves at a glacial speed, and many stocks do get ahead of themselves. Do lots of homework on companies that are developers of mines. The only producers that need to be considered for a newbie is Cameco, Uranium energy Corp, boss energy and energy fuels. If you want more then look at Sprotts Uranium information on their website. Dont listen to hype on YouTube, X, and other sources. Its a great opportunity to buy a non fungible, scarce and undervalued commodity, but dont expect to make life changing money if you consider yourself an average investor, much of the easy money has been made already in the sitting and waiting. Now is the time to look for value, performance and the companies that are actually going to be able to mine this resources at significant quantities well into the future.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"The uranium market is already seeing a mix of tight supply and rising demand for nuclear energy, especially as countries push for clean energy solutions. Kazakhstans recent production cuts and the U.S. banning Russianenriched uranium are only going to add more pressure to an already constrained market. On top of that, demand for uranium is expected to grow as China and other nations continue to build nuclear reactors. Prices have been fluctuating, but many experts believe they will rise again due to these supply and demand dynamics. Whats also interesting is how big tech companies are now getting involved. Microsoft recently signed a deal to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power its data centers, while Oracle is building small modular reactors SMRs to fuel its AI data centers.

Basically a breeder reactor that uses a cheaper and more abundant fuel source. This style of reactor was designed in the 1950s and I honestly believe the main reason this hasnt been developed further is more due to proliferation risks than cost or feasibility. Since the Protactinium233 can be extracted rather easily and would be of high concentration, it would reduce a lot of the work needed to make a nuclear weapon.

The mine is running now, can be scaled, and is run by seasoned professionals.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"TL,DR from ChatGPT Summary Uranium Market Report Price Trends Since 2020, uranium prices have surged from 21lb to 106lb in February 2024, currently stabilizing at 83lb. The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected. Uranium Overview Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U238 used in military applications and U235 used to fuel nuclear reactors. U235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal. HALEU and Enrichment Highassay lowenriched uranium HALEU is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives. Supply Challenges Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 1015 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30 by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap. Demand Growth The U.S., China, and France account for 58 of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28 increase in demand from 20232030 and a 51 rise from 20312040, driven by global clean energy goals. Global Production Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43 of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward selfreliance. Investment Insights The report suggests that mining companies are wellpositioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector. Conclusion The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uraniums role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"no because unlike with other forms of fuel, uranium costs are a tiny portion of the overall cost of building and operating a reactor. the majority of the cost is the upfront capex for building the reactor 10s of billions for big multireactor plants. then, the marginal cost of loading them with reactor is almost negligible in comparison. due to how expensive reactors are to build, countries cant afford to let then sit idle regardless of uranium prices. It was calculated that 700lbs is the cutoff at which point it becomes uneconomical to keep running the reactors. this is 8x the current price. due to these factors, uranium supply is priceinelastic",Neutral,0,0.951222836971283,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-16,Its not about disagreeing. Its about being a better solution. Even in the winter solar just wont even generate enough energy nor will wind. And if we create enough windmills to have enough energy in the winter then theyll be sitting on their arses whole summer. It is not a solution for baseline energy it is a complementary solution to the baseline. Then you fill in with renewables and batteries which can also charge from overproduction of a nuclear facility. Furthermore I think energy production should be more decentralized which reduces the scale of some energy plants and makes it more cost effective. See SMR which china is already starting production of. If we can streamline and make the production of it more efficient itll probably even cost less money than all other energy sources.,Positive,1,0.9504442811012268,Reply

If youre really interested in the companyplay it wouldnt be a bad idea to listen throughwatch the investor conference they had along with this earnings. Im tentatively bullish on the company still. I think Lemonis has a lot of good ideas and has reformed after giving too many overly optimistic projections. He seems to be making much more conservative promises. I think having physical towel stores again is going to be a great thing for the company, letting people out in the world know that the brand still exists. Lemonis bought 1.5m in shares after the earnings reportthe stock tanking, which was by far his largest buyin to date. That unfortunately for me did absolutely nothing to move the stock up. I think the market is waiting for tangible results before theyre going to reprice. Shorts are probably still hoping for the bankruptcy. There was a lot of other bullish news before and after earnings, and again, none of that did anything to positively impact the price of the stock. That said, I think the stock is still highly undervalued even for the current situation. The company has a good balance sheet and other valuable assets. If you take the market cap and subtract their assets then the market is essentially valuing the company at 0. Lmk if you have any other questions though. Happy to chat despite the pain this has caused me. Edit I do also still have a very small position on. Calls for next June and Jan 2026.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Some minor details in need of correctionclarification. Radar and lidar are also capable of detecting and classifying pedestrians either by themselves or as part of a multimodal sensor suite. In fact they can be better than cameras in some circumstances, low light as you mentioned. Some lidars also give Dopplerrelative speed not sure if Waymos does but I know AURs does. Video processing is necessarily a much more resource intensive task than processing lidar or radar data. Now everyone I know that has radar and lidar also has cameras, so that may not be important but there are probably some optimizations that having multiple sensors allows a reduction in the amount of video that needs to be processed. Rapid iteration is not a differentiator, everyone doing self driving Waymo included can push updates whenever they want. Most also use Continuous integration pipelines. Regulatory hurdles are mostly propagandafake news auto companies self certify for safety, other than FMVSS rules which are testable requirements NHTSA can verify. FMVSS rules are very easy to comply with and say nothing about autonomy. There are some FMVSS changes required to remove steering wheel pedals and other things but those changes have been in process for years and should be done soon if it hasnt already happened, not familiar with the latest status. The easy work around is to simply not delete these until the rules change, theres also a waiver process that some companies I believe have successfully completed to delete these components. The real regulatory hurdle is liability, and needing to pay out millions in damages when a court determines your product killed someone and the manufacturer is liable. In other words the only real barrier is tech readiness. Regulatory hurdles are just an excuse that wallstreet types tend to buy.",Neutral,0,0.9974735379219055,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-08,"Ok, Ill play the devils advocate. And I hate doing this Just assume, that China built up a giant real estate bubble. That bubble went close to bust, so China did, what any reasonable regulator would have done and created a giant credit bubble, which it injected into the real estate bubble, in order to stabilize that one. People got loans, which, even if they didnt miss their payments, they wouldnt be able to pay off in their lifetime and their heirs would have to take over. Then Beijing did an actually reasonable thing It tried to let the air slowly out of that bubble. This led to some collapses. Nothing to serious for the system. But the economy slowed down. And cashflows dried up. And money started fleeing the country in trillions. The main reason for this was not the government action, but the Corona lockdown and ripple effects. Those, who still invested in the country chose a secure investment 10 year chinese treasury bonds. They bought so many of them, that the state begun discouraging it, because banks going to long led to the collapse of the SVB and they saw that threat if there was a run on chinese banks. But the economy slowed further and the real aconomic data they saw became troubling. So the state did, what any good state would have done They set up a big stimulus package. And everything was great. Except it wasnt. Because now there was a stock market rally and everyone everywhere who did not want to miss the boat suddenly needed liquidity to buy stocks. And the approximately 4.000 small to mid cap chinese banks who are to long in their investments get in trouble providing that liquidity. So they do, what every good bank does Instead of rolling over the loans they give to local government, they want repayment. But there is an issue. While the central state of China has massive reserves, the local governments are 34 trillion Dollar in debt. And they cant pay. So the central government declares to loan a couple of dozen billion Dollar to local governments. And everybody thinks, thats just another stimulus. And they cheer. And they draw more liquidity from the banks with the 10 year treasuries. To invest in the stock market. Which is financed by the banks. Which hold the bad mortgages. And whose liquidity is locked up. Im not saying China is going to crash. I atill dontwant to believe it. I hold some ETFs myself. But everything I wrote is more or less the case according to various different pieces of financial reporting. So in order to fix this, China will have to do a lot more that what has beend announced so far. I suppose they will. They might be less dogmatic about letting the market regulate itself, than the US was back in the day. But there is an element of risk involved in China investments.

Reddit,2024-10-07,Missteps? Right...and the Titanics maiden voyage could have been a little smoother. Most companies dont make it back from major blunders. DEC was 2 computer company in the world from the same time period as Intel. They missed Unix and the PC. Gone. Silicon Graphics were 1 in graphic workstations. Gone. Sun was 1 in Unix. Gone. Wang was 1 in word processing systems. Gone. ICL 1 in computers in UK. Gone. Sperry. Burroughs. Gone. Lotus used to dominate spreadsheets and email. Gone. Netscape used to dominate browsers. Gone. The list goes on in the IT field. The only exception is Microsoft which languished for decades at 40 and then transformed in the last 15 years. IBM is going through the same process but the jury is still out. If you want to bet on a resurrection knock yourself out but most legacy companies do not make successful transitions. Intel dominated AMD but got fat and lazy. There are many new companies with much less baggage. My bet is on one of those.,Negative,-1,0.9905161261558533,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Update 2 This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Neutral,0,0.9939711689949036,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-28,"Eh, I have no real comments on the shorts reports, but VTOL is an extremely difficult thing that military has spend hundreds of billions and 80 years trying to make work with not much reliable success. Helicopters are considered mature technology yet also still very dangerous. Energy density of oil is still vastly superior to any batteries available which puts some hard current limits on things like range versus capacity. That said, theres some key differences between those and evtol. From a risk management perspective, All its going to take is one highly public Kobe Bryant or a Troy Gentry and the whole things going to crater.

Reddit,2024-09-28,I dont have patience to write long DD like this but can claim that I have done extensive research on this. My personal position is 100 LEAPS for Joby and 2150 in stock. I only believe in Joby and I strongly feel Archer is going to fold or go bust in 4 years or less. I will give reasons for this in short as I dont have patience n dont have time or care to convince anyone. 1. Joby truly developed eVTOL from scratch and have complete new new design. Archer is just electric helicopter where they are assembler of aircraft where why may have just swap the engine with electric motors. Due to this their aircraft is almost 1200lbs heavier than Joby. This in itself going to kill then in operating cost and cannot compete with Joby which will multi fold efficient n cheaper to operate thereby cheaper on pricing 2. Archer is mostly style n less substance. Their flight has yet to do extensive flight testing. They are flying empty . So currently its just baloon with no payload. Once you add payload most likely their design will go bust. The design is too heavy n bulky 3. Dilution Archer is going for extensive dilution every quarter against plant setup and labor supply from Stellantis . Moreover they plan issue more shares. 4. Archer certification in time is very difficult given they need to integrate number of desperate components n technology. Joby developed almost 8090 IP inhouse so they integrate seamlessly with common software language. 5. Archer is led by businessman vs Joby is led by technocrat 6. Joby has successfully tested hydrogen flight. In 56 year they will have it approved. Then they will have huge cost advantage and unparalleled technology edge 7. Autonomy only Joby has full autonomous rights to their own plane. Archer sold it to WiskBoeing. Robo AirTaxi. This is where real money is. Believe me Robo AirTaxi will happen before TeslaWaymo or Aurora. Once you do in depth study you will uncover few more obvious reasons why archer is way behind and over priced at current valuation. Overall Archer is not gonna pop its gonna poop soon.,Neutral,0,0.9943521022796631,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Nice DD, thanks for taking the time and effort to make it. Ive looked into Archer a few times now and while Im tempted to buy in, I have a couple of hurdles Im struggling to get over. First of all Im having a hard time seeing a scenario where they arent just acquired by another megacorp. Boeing going ballsdeep and consolidating them with Wisk makes a lot of sense both companies are functionally the same, it merely seems to be the case that Archer want to push a more VIP and militaryoriented aircraft lineup while Wisk is designed much more in the mould of an airtaxi Uber. Stellantis might also be interested in a direct acquisition if they can envision a more profitable return by cutting out other major investors like United and Boeing, as well as gaining them exposure to valuable US military contracts. Im also not fully convinced by the eVTOL airtaxi concept. As a means of rapid transportation it does have potential is there anyone who doesnt want to reach their destination not just in style but also half an hour earlier?? but I need to know exactly how theyre going to make it affordable for people that arent just highincome earners, because otherwise it will ultimately be an unprofitable service due to the complexity of the technology and the lack of a large clientele base.

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Oh its time. I knew it was time. I feel it. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. ... However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. ... While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Neutral,0,0.9955098628997803,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-28,"Good DD I have no issue with Joby but there are a few counter points to your DD that should be understood. 1. You make a big deal about creating their own IP but Archers counter point is that their parts are industry standard and can be purchased and produced more easily. Personally, I think both have a fair point. Archer also has their own IP in the most important parts which include the drive train. 2. I really like the look and feel of Archer way more than Joby. Joby looks like they took a drone from DJI and scaled it up to a person capable aircraft. Not necessarily a bad thing but as far as style goes Archer definitely has that edge. Also, they will soon have their pilot test certification soon. So thats no really a great argument against them. Their fortest certification is coming soon and will be a major announcement. 3. Nothing really to say here as this stuff aint cheap. Raising capital is something they both have to do. Its not like you can make the argument that Joby doesnt have to do this too. Both are have delivered aircraft to the military and both are set to deliver more. Again, both will be players in this arena and thats a good thing. Competition is a good thing. Dont forget a short report and subsequent short float on Joby is a thing too as their short is about 19. The reason why I chose Archer however is that their current market cap has much deeper value than Joby at these current levels. Currently Joby is valued at 3.74 Billion while Archer Aviation is valued at only 1.09 Billion with a much higher float. So, with all of that I have to think Archer at this moment is a better buy. Both of their market caps can easily be in the 50 100 Billion range in the 4 6 year future which will be a substantial gain for all those invested. In the short term, if Archer keeps pushing and gets their certs a 3x increase will be a 3 Billion market cap and that seems completely justified. That would also be a 300 increase in the stock price from 3 to 9 a share. I say this is an easy bagger if you ask me. Deep fucking value if there ever was one.",Neutral,0,0.9411562085151672,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"As of September 2024, the West continues to impose heavy sanctions and restrictions on imports of many Russian goods, particularly in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"That will be an interesting time. Current Starship estimates are 100 to 150 tons to LEO. So 6.6 to 10 times more than Neutrons barge landing LEO capacity. I am not sure about the price though. SpaceX already spend 5 billion dollars on the starship development. And the first few years the starships are already sold Artemis mission, Musks Mars mission etc. Another important aspect if you deploy a constellation like Starlink you do not put every satellite into the same orbital plane. You need to insert the satellites into different orbital planes so launching 100 or even 150 tons of satellites into a single orbital plane does not make sense. You could of course solve that with orbital transfer vehicles, but that adds weight and cost. So lets see how that plays out long term. If Starships becomes dominating RocketLab positioned Neutron well to scale it up. Instead of Merlins gas generator engine they went with a ox rich staged combustion engine. One can expect performance gains over time look at how much Blue Origin gets out of a ox rich staged combustion engine of similar size. If satellites and payloads in general become significantly larger and heavier due to Starship RocketLab could use the same engines for the heavy lift rocket and maybe even use the Neutron 1st stage as a 2nd stage of the heavy lift rocket. Starship is 50 meters high and 9 meter wide. Neutron is 42 meters high and 7 meters wide. Plus the tank parts are potentially stretchable.",Neutral,0,0.9998407363891602,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,Fair points. Especially that Starlink is an amazing cashcow. And RocketLab does not have the funds yet? to replicate that. SpaceX launch frequency is impressive. But RocketLab scaled Electron faster to 50 launches that SpaceX scaled F9 to 50 launches even with reuse. If they can replicate that and also scale Neutron faster than SpaceX scaled F9 it could get even in that regard interesting. Not handing your competitor cash Amazon Kuiper vs. Starlink is a big incentive to go with the maybe slightly more expensive option. SpaceX is still clearly ahead. And by a margin. But that competition gets more interesting by the day. And the valuation difference is too high. SpaceX is valued at 200 billion in private. In public it would probably be 500 b. It doesnt make sense that RocketLab is only valued at 5 b. So far they are 2nd behind SpaceX. They are scaling their revenue impressively. From 60 m to 400m in like 4 years. With positive gross margins. They should be valued higher already in my opinion reason for me to buy in.,Positive,1,0.9999942779541016,Reply

The space systems side of the business is fully profitable, and the electron launch part of the business is fully profitable, theyre just net cash flow negative because a big rocket costs a lot to develop and build, but some of the most costly elements of developing neutron are already out of the way.

Archimedes is also a good starting point for a starship like vehicle. Unlike Falcon 9s engine it is a high performing staged combustion engine. In 10 years they are maybe already almost done developing a starship sized vehicle. There will be a need for a lot of 1 way trips to Mars and maybe the carbon composites are cheaper than stainless steel if you do not reuse the vehicle. Starlink is a great example of whats possible in the satellite space. RocketLab isnt able to start with something like that. But they could get their overtime.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"Thanks for explaining your strategy, it makes sense. What I mainly meant with democratizing space access is that the cost to get things into space has been dropping. Havent found much up to date examples but this data from 2019 shows that the cost per kg has dropped from about 10 000 to 1500. And we see due to that all these constellations starting to pop up. Since this makes it more affordable companies will pop up with new and novel ideas. And since Rocket lab can provide the engineering and servicing to design and build these payloads, that is a market that will grow. I agree there is danger of a bubble forming, especially since we have ridiculous ideas like a company that wants to put giant ass mirrors in space so you can order sunlight via an app And I obviously glanced over the fact that RKLB is not profitable yet, but if they would stop all neutron development they would be profitable. And hopefully with neutron flying they will swing to profitability. I admit all these space stocks are risky and an obvious gamble. Personally I believe in RKLB and also ASTS.

Until you start looking at it was from 20192023 and not in one year This should have been a red flag for any one reading. Then you have to look at the thing the article didnt talk about which is how much did inflation and cost of living rise during that sametime. Food prices 25 increase Housing 40 Rent 20 Inflation CPI increased by 1520 with energy up 3040 by 2023, So again while great it rose 13 it has not kept up with the cost of living.

As it was, they were still burning that money printer basically ever since the financial crisis until COVID. Imo, that was wildly irresponsible and unnecessary. They could have eased off to better prep. Tbf, thats not all on Powell its also on Yellen.
