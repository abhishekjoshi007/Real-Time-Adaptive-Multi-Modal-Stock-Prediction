From my perspective, its conservative mgmt that has always beat and raised and outpaced analyst expectations theyve also called out in regards to 26 guidance that it didnt incorporate any new products which theyve had new launches since this guidance was released and will inevitably have more. I also personally disagree that a high growth fintech should be valued as a legacy bank most of which have sub 10 rev growth. If their tech platform really accelerates and gets deals with large financial institutions itll be hard to ignore its part of the valuation delta vs banks. Theyve also leaned into originating for other companies no capital loan origination and loan servicing revenue where they dont take on risk. Its possible that growth completely stagnates in 27 but I dont think itll be that mature of company by then. Right now massive tailwinds for company with interest rate cuts, regulatory changes driving demand for tech platform, significant demand for loans for higher income individuals which is Sofia bread and butter. Im extremely bullish over next year , not necessarily beyond that as there wont be as much comparative tailwinds."

The reason you want to park money into staples is precisely that they have a high likelihood of being around in 40, 60, 80 and 100 years and they are very likely to keep growing the entire time. This is why staples are powerful. For instance, pull up a sector market share chart. If you do that you will notice something interesting. Techs market share has actually gone no where since the late 60s. It peaked in the .com bubble and is again in a slight bubble now, but overall, not changed since then. What has changed is the companies within. Lots of boom and busts and big time consolidation and concentration of value. Staples havent really changed much either in terms of market share but like I try to describe above, its very easy to pick winners from staples precisely because they are not boom and bust. At worst, they get bought out but they will never go obsolete. This low risk characteristic is extremely valuable because even a dummy can pick winner 90 of the time. You cant say that about picking tech or finance or even energy stocks. Are the big tech giants of the 60s still around? Some yes, but mostly no. Are all those popular fracking companies from the 2000s still around? Most went under in the financial crash. And banks are like revolving bankruptcies even if they dont go under entirely.... Folks need to start respecting risk and practice risk mitigation. There is a total disregard for that on this channel in favor of getting rich quick on the next double or 10 bagger. Every portfolio posted is like 90 tech... many are 100 tech... its like everything thinks they will time the market just right to get out at peaks. It wont work. A few people will get rich, but most will look back and wish they bought KO instead."

Its possible because im no genius, but i can read financials, 10ks and have an imagination of the future. New sectors are transforming and popping up. Like i said, im 29. No one in their 20s should be buying coca cola stock if they want to get rich. 10 revenue growth is okay. But is it the best place to park money? Most companies if you are into msrket research and you are decent, will exist in 30,40,50 years. I also didnt say select companies. The nasdaq and schd all have companies that will be around and carry the index overbthat same time horizon versus KO being a single company yet will surpass KO in price appreciation by 5x over 20 years, 10x in 30 years. And you want to throw in risk mitigation. Coca cola will not exist forever. Perhaps that is the best some can do. But i said what i said to have other readers who aspire for more to challenge their approach. Why are we in this game? To make good moves. To make big moves. If youre 6065 and this a simple way to play the game and you cant do research or dont want to consult an FA, sure KO all the way with procter and gamble and the like."

That was BS of newsmedia translation to fool retailers. With yield jumping from 3.7 to 4.2, the Yieldcurve inversion is 0.41 today. FED reduces two rate cuts, this will very likely uninvert to lead a recessionary crash. Bond market is silently doing and newmedia wont report anything they do not know until after the fact."

Feds biggest worry is wage price spiral which was a problem after pandemic due to labor shortage, now it does not seem to be a problem since companies are not hiring aggressively. That said, I dont think Fed is going to cut rates aggressively, rates are not very high at the moment, we do not want inflation to come back again, that will set things back. They will go slow and easy, 25bps cuts, unless inflation is really down below 2.5 consistently, at the moment it is not below 2.5 and it is too early, we had only like 45 months of inflation below 3."

Deflation is bad for the economy because it discourages spending, investment, and consumption at the macro level. Sure, deflation would benefit inelastic essentials like food, but in a service based economy that relies heavily on capital investment and consumption, 8 deflation over several years would have disastrous effects. Deflation increases the purchasing power per dollar, which on the surface sounds good until you realize it also means wages will go down. It also discourages investment at all levels since rampant deflation would create a sentiment that its better to hold off since you can get more for your money later on. Why take the risk investing in the market or investing in RD if you could earn 8 just having the money sit in a bank account. High deflation would also decimate people with mortgages or loans since the payments on the loan remain the same while the purchasing power per dollar and their wages would be going down. So their monthly mortgage payments would be going up over time in real terms. High inflation is also bad, but a small amount of inflation like 2 benefits everyone because it means spending and investment is encouraged since money is losing 2 of its value if its doing nothing, and payments on mortgages and loans go down in real terms over long periods. Overall, deflation or zero inflation creates a culture of saving like in Japan and a small amount of inflation creates a culture of spendinginvesting."

                    "text": "Kind of disagree. The consumer is sick of the Starbucks ripoff. Theyre looking for value, not sweet drinks that cost as much as a meal. Id been skeptical that just tweaks could fix that. I do believe making some big and fundamental and newsgenerating changes could fix Starbucks business. I also believe the small tweaks wont do anything. Seeing that 4 point letter from Niccol screams tweaks not true fundamental change. Its as much BS corpospeak as what Laxman was putting out. Empower the barista. Please. Ive read the employeedominated sub, and the theme is theyre sick of being worked to death and it sounds like many dont even like the customers. Understand the market isnt exactly a forensic fix for China. Customers tired of being ripped off dont need to be told the Starbucks story. The name on cups gag is played out. Making Starbucks a community coffeehouse isnt really what consumers want, and isnt necessarily good for the business. They want better value and they want to get in and out quickly. The 25 pop was the market assuming Niccol could make the inandout quickly thing, and the perceived value thing happen. This letter sounds like he doesnt even understand the problem. And the market annointing him as universal problem solving saint may be misguided. Yes, CMG stock had incredible growth and the brand became widely loved... for the first half of his tenure. But the second half is not as pretty. When problems started to appear, he seemed incapable of identifying and addressing them proactively. Chipotle is now widely perceived as being a ripoff and too bland. Bad portion sizes. Skimping on ingredients and quality. He seemed paralyzed and clueless about that. His last big public appearance before abandoning the ship was him goofily claiming the portions were consistent, as big as your head, and that if you ever felt you werent getting value, you should personally try to shame the worker into topping up your plate. Thats out of touch, not problem solving. So a perhaps more sober assessment of Niccol is that he was present while CMG rode the advantage of the stock being pummeled from killing customers with unsafe food, and then when the time came to actually solve problems, he couldnt recognize them let alone solve them. And now hes the one walking into a problemfest at Starbucks. I took my 24 gains and am waiting to see what happens. If I were given that job, instead of issuing that bad, pithy letter, heres what Id do acknowledge the deep problems which are a consumer no longer willing to pay luxury price for sugary milkshakes, employees placed in unfulfilling situations, operational inability to have quick, high volume output. fixes would be in the form of Big Bang changes and candid humility. Look to the dominos model where they apologized and acknowledged cardboard level pizza. Fix the bad, burnt coffee taste perception. look also to McDonalds who knows you have to keep volume going even when consumers are strapped and sick of you, and they do that with inarguably value through literal value menus. Id have some newsgenerating low priced options as a form of Starbucks value menu look also to McDonalds who figured out how to massively pump out drive through where your order is prepared in the time it takes between ordering and paying and pickup window, and then making that parallel with two or more lanes. Id overhaul the operations substantially. Despite what coffeehouse baristas think, efficient machines can make most of a drink just fine. Weve all had delicious mass produced smoothies, Nespressos, etc. Id lean heavy on such automation and preparation to massively ramp up how much and how quickly a location can pump out the drinks, and let the baristas be more of a presentation element. Let them use their time and personalities with the customers instead of tamping away and washing seives in the back. Yes, Id be fine with a scenario where premade or machine made drinks are pumped out under a counter and a charming baritas focus on pretending they made it and making the customer feel happy and that theyve been served quickly. Make it globally known that the long lineups are over and that you can get a plain coffee for 3 from the value menu. this would address both the biggest consumer deterrents plus make life liveable for the baristas. it turns Starbucks back into a perceived affordable treat, an attainable piece of luxury at a good price. Theres more, but you get the point. Sure, theres a halo on Niccol, and a whole ecosystem of Wall Street and financial news media that is invested in claiming Starbucks is great regardless of the truth. But in terms of actual transformational change, my plan seems to have more substance than tell the Starbucks story"

First, you get the algos and other short term traders who are more interested in momentum and volume.

Other long term buyers might disregard the report and see opportunities to buy and hold as it falls, thinking it will come out of this a stronger company. Btfd Big institutional sellers can not sell large amounts of a company quickly without losing a significant amount of the value.

Everyone is targeting kids for more money. Not sure why you think the burden of raising children is the job of roblox. Not every kid has social media apps or unfettered access to all of this stuff. Im not sure why you assume Im thinking the burden of raising kids is their job. The fact of the matter is when you make a product for primarily kids, you take on the responsibility to make it safe. Adding social features meant they took on that moderation responsibility. If they cant handle that then parents will just stop allowing their kids to play it. Also, nobody is slinging CP except for feds, has nobody figured that out yet. Unfortunately thats just not true.

If they were just losing money on the transition capex, Id be with you. But they arent, theyre losing ungodly amounts of money on their actual COGS. Just to display the severity of the situation, Ford is unable to make a car as good as the Model Y even with 3x the production cost. And thats on top of having to spend billions to retool their factories into much less efficient factories than Teslas. Theres no coming back from that. Theyll be lucky to still be operational as a niche player selling under 1M cars a year by 2030."

Nike could seriously sell 2 million pairs of those for 180 instead of 150k for 150 and make a fucking killing. I could go on for hours about ways to fix Nike, but they seem too stupid to get out of their own way. I entered 9 fucking raffles from various retailers to get those shoes and tried on Nikes SNKRS app, which has no bot protection by the way. Couldnt get a pair. I have never bought Reps before but Im sick of Nikes shit and may look at it in some of their hype shoes. Some Reps are honestly higher quality than the real deal. Nikes Quality Control is dog shit.

For instance, on the conservativelibertarian side, you can easily make the argument that total benefits are a large cause, where large portions of wage increases are simply being swallowed up by larger health insurance premiums employers are covering behind the scenes. Or that marriage isnt as common, so greater numbers of single person households are weighing down the household income numbers. Most leftleaning sources Ive found never take into account job benefits at all, and also tend to zero in on income classes rather than total dollars. Allinall I feel both sides likely have points to be made and the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle wages havent been horribly stagnant, but they also havent fully kept up."

The shelf space gives them an advantage against other start ups but is still tied to their own performance and bigger brands can still just substitute old products with new ones and be an immediate treat due to the low entry barrier. 23 of the category sales is through retail, so ecommerce is also not that important for snacksbars I would be really cautious about your assumption of a health conscious consumer. While I would agree that healthier eating is on the raise it doesnt mean plant based alternatives are also winning. Actually we know from trails at McDonalds and the evolution of plant based brands like Oatly that the demand might be limited. Simply Good Food does seem to be managed well as they are decreasing debt while increasing margins but for a growth stock the falling revenue growth is still a warning sign. Which seems to be reflected in the current stock performance. In general, I dont see a point in creating a 20 year strategy with single stocks. What might be a good stock now can be seen completely different in the 510 years because of bad management, macroeconomics, regulatory changes or consumer behavior shifts. If you believe in the category its probably more of an ETF or managed funds opportunity."

The Fed should ask that the government use fiscal policy to do something about the housing shortage, so they can cut rates to help the goods industries. But they probably know that the government doesnt want the price of housing to stop going up. Both liberals and conservatives want housing prices to keep going up. Dont listen to what they say, only look at the results of what they do. If the Federal and state government wanted to do something to make housing affordable, they could enact these four changes to the housing policy Enact incentives for home builders so they can intentionally overbuild even when prices are in decline. Enact incentives for home buyers so then can move to where housing is affordable, safe and insurable. Enact incentives for employers to locate jobs to where housing is affordable, safe and insurable. Enact new taxes to punish employers who dont pay their workers enough to live near where they work. If all four of these changes were made in the housing policy, cities who have codes that prevent home construction would notice that employers and home buyers are leaving the area to buy better affordable housing. Simply if they fail to do new home construction, people would leave in search of affordable housing instead of trying to out compete the rich people and investors and corporations. Also if codes are so lax that new houses are not insurable, not energy efficient, built in unsafe areas or built as sprawl in the middle of nowhere, the builder wouldnt want to build because they wont make money if houses wont sell. Cities that let builders build good quality safe and affordable housing would have a lot of growth and prosperity.

I would allow everyone to own 3 houses, and after that tax the fuck out of them so that it makes no fiscal sense to own more than that. But if this leads to fewer people wanting to buy houses, that would be a good thing as it would drive down the cost of homes. Also, youd still be incentivized to buy because of the magic of locking in a price. I bought my house in 2009, and 15 years later I have a 2009 mortgage payment in 2024.

Little Bit of wasted work for Man United but fundamentally good Analysis and solid quality post. We need more of this here."

I cant speak for MANU specifically, but in the U.S. there are often ways that the owners benefit financially from owning a team that will not show up on the company books. For instance, they might own most of the parking near the stadium but privately or in a separate entity. In a publicly traded company like MANU that doesnt help shareholders any but it does mean that owning the team is more valuable to a buyer than simply being able to show off."

I read many interviews with former players complaining about the infrastructure, work ethics etc. The club is also far behind when it comes to use of technology and data. Imo Man United is still capitalizing on thier popularity that was build during their best years 19952013. It is definitely not the club that is going upwards both as a sport club and as a company. Also whoever came up with the idea to give it the ticket MANU clearly doesnt know club history. Google ,,why not to call Manchester United as Man U."

Uh....dude, you value them the way you normally do and, no, dont use GAAPbased Net Income.....saw you flagged a bunch of noncash expenses that can generally be ignored during a valuation exercise.... by looking at historic actual operating cash flow and EBITDA values consensus broker estimates on the next two years worth of cash flows 5.0 There is no value? So, is there no value? Is one of the biggest clubs in the world worthless? For a company the generates 100mm to 200mm in organic cash flow per year? Yeah, Id say theres a good bit of value in there. This fact is further backed up when looking at MANUs trading multiples which all are in a fairly reasonable range of 18.0x 13.0x on an Firm Value EBITDA basis and 17.0x 8.0x on a Market Cap OCF basis..... Id argue that Manchester United, like other sports clubs, arent valued, as theres no significant positive free cash flow. Instead, they are being priced. They are in the same group as Pokemon cards, antiques, and art paintings. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Except, the beholders are billionaires, and theyre likely going through a checklist. I think this line of logic is flawed since a weve shown that MANU does consistently generate cash flow no, cash flow accrual income and arent valued based on greaterfool or bag holder theory like noncash yielding investments like Pokemon cards, Beanie Babies, Crypto, etc....."

As these numbers grow and people live closer to service centers the sales numbers will continue to grow. They have a unique product unlike anything on market now.

They were lucky to go public at that valuation, but shareholders who piled into that bubble got obliterated. Looking forward, RIVN probably is one of the few smaller companies that went public in 202021 who will get through this period but I dont think thats ultimately as exciting as people think. Too many people still treating the EV theme like its the 202021 bubble and trying to pick the next Tesla. Meanwhile, a number of 202021 EV ipospac names are already 0s some of which are 0s for the second time. The automobile business with a couple of exceptions is not a great business I mean, again multiple EV companies that went public a few years ago already 0s and Tesla made everyone think it is, despite Musk frequently going on about what a difficult business it is over the years. So, can RIVN bounce? Sure. Is it going lower if there was a recession in the next couple years? Absolutely. Do I think it can be one of the few smaller names that ultimately gets through this period? Yes, but I think the market has gone back to the idea that automobiles are not a great business and people keep wanting them to be something they arent. So, I think RIVN could bounce on any good news, its going to be a tough hold through whenever the next recession is and on the other side of that will probably do fine on the upturn but I think people still expect too muchis it the next TSLA!?!?! from the theme."

I heard battery might be commoditized .. so maybe battery recycling. Think what changes in the car architecture.. more motors more copper more high voltage electric lines and interconnects .. companies like molex amphenol comes to mind. Then semiconductors that focus on power conversions and controls like nxp infineon renesas will also win irrespective of who sells more EV. Then there are utility companies which should see more demand along with data centers. There is massive work in EV infrastructure and charging but again focus on the vendors and not necessarily blink or charge point. Along with ev.. there will be a shift to automation .. the players making the cameras lidar chips and software would make more profit than waymo Tesla or gm who are competing to bring the vehicles. It doesnt mean that Rivian or Tesla is a bad investment but its no longer a first mover environment... I have no idea of knowing if they will or will not but if I trust that EV is going to be the future.. then I would bet on the supply chain. Solar might be a big winner in EV . Not so much in data center case. Think ancillary issues... Charging time is still a problem... Land is limited... You want chargers in strategic location. Who has land that might become useless with ev chargers.. think the gas stations... So they will transition there with scope of commercial real estate developing. Else the grid will transition to micro grid with battery storage becoming more critical."

Theyve subtley commoditized and collapsed the nascent LLM startups, while gaining a decade long lead in the hardest hardware development ever which is indeed those next gen Orion glasses.

Its impressive that they could get a 69 degree FOV with waveguide technology. The big downside is that you have 3 things that go together with this device. The power puck, the glasses and the wristband thing. Its not just glasses. Its 3 things. The glasses are too thick for prime time. They will have to figure out how to chop that thickness almost in half, which could be impossible. They also need to dramatically increase the resolution. Increasing the FOV would be great, but I think theyre pretty much hitting a hard limit with it. Still a solid decade away from a real AR glasses contender"

Its also more compact and therefore doesnt feel as heavy. Those factors mean more comfort overall and less headaches with extended use. There are some nice looking games coming out soon as well. The big problem I have so far is the lack of good and functional apps built for the devices. Like, why do we not have a Hulu or Disney plus app? Thats really my big complaint the developers of apps arent supporting the devices, which means they become niche and people would rather have their smartphones.

And that makes the weight issue described above even worse. 4 What if I already wear glasses? Do you expect me to just wear two pairs of glasses at once? Or pay extra to get my prescription lens in a pair of AR glasses, only to then not be able to wear my prescription glasses when its charging its battery? And on top of all that a smartphone can already do all of the good things you mentioned, without all of the flaws that I mentioned."

Like the AR on Google maps but no need to hold your phone up. 95 of my driving is between my workplace, my home, my familys homes, and stores I like. I go out of town and need to GPS to a location maybe once or twice per year, and that involves glancing at my dashboardmounted phone for a singular microsecond about 5 times per hour for the duration of the drive. Automatic text translation just by looking at foreign text. Neat, sounds pretty SciFi. But were already in a world where I can aim my phone at the same text and have it translated in 3 seconds without putting any adspace directly on my eyeballs. Automatic vocal translation. See above. It will work just as well as your phone already does. Youre paying a 300 premium to avoid looking at your phone for 20 seconds. AR art displays. Youre going to see a black box unless you pay to unlock it. Exceptions with complex context like the Never Hike Alone movies aside, no one makes unmonetized creative work. No one. Even if someone tries, Zuck will slap an ad above it. Where do you think youre seeing an AR art display for free? Public AR profiles that others can view, displaying achievements or whatever. Wow, how useful for society. Leaderboards are never toxic in video games, so sure, why not bring them into real life? All the obvious gaming, photography, and video use cases as well. Hooray, more entertainment! Thats great, I was just thinking I didnt have enough access to TV shows and video games and shit. Basically anything you currently do with your phone but never having to take out your phone. Lmao. This device can do everything that 4 other devices you already own can do. 300 please. Dont forget the protection plan, insurance, and monthly payment for Plus content. 419.35 12.99mo please. What do you mean is Plus worth it... dont you see the obvious benefit to constantly consuming different content on each lens? Youll also only have to see 1 ad per hour, where normal users have to see 5, and 2 of them are video! OF COURSE PLUS IS WORTH IT!!"

Unfortunately the passthrough is just not quite there yet to make it usable for long periods of time for me personally. Thats why Meta is making glasses so you dont need passthrough. Even though theres benefits, its hard to convince people to do their entertainment, exercise, and productivity inside of VRAR when the drawbacks are so apparent. Again, I love my Quest 3 though and recommend it to people, but theres a ways to go before it will get widespread adoption. Itll get there, Meta is doing a great job imo in innovating in this space."

It likely wont even get the original language right. The AR art displays is an interesting idea though. I could also see it being used as an enhancement for Pokemon GO style games. The other thing you have to think about is that a lot of this processing would need to be done locally by the glasses. If it requires too much processing and has to be sent to the cloud and back, the lag is going to mess with you pretty bad.

In conclusion, the Fed has sacrificed the last parts of the fight against inflation to protect employment because they believe in a number of fallacies shelter lag, monetary policy is still tight, unemployment is worse than inflation.

In a nutshell, The system is designed to concentrate wealth to the rich by repeating the same cycle over and over. Print a fk ton of money, tell the people we need to raise interest rates to tame inflation so businesses cant afford loans and families cant afford to refinance their homes. This results in the rich buying homes for a discount and small businesses dying which monopolizes every sector. Because the purchasing power of the dollar plummeted from the printing, companies have to raise their prices and lay people off the regain previous margins. This leads to your money buying fewer goods and you having less to spend because you were laid off. Less spending as a consumer leads to lower margins for companies. This spiral continues until a recession. Then the fed prints more money to stimulate the economy and the cycle continues. All by design."

The home Im living in, is made with the great technology of probably earlymid 1800s the house itself is from 1950 maybe 40s out of adobe a clay like material, very good insulator, and apart from repaints and shit doesnt really have any problems thatd require fiddling with the walls. Bricks also tend to not go bad. HOAs are designed to help boost home prices, but thats dumb as shit, if you just buy one and live there till youre old. I guess in this bucket could go the weird thing that some countries do where you buy a home, and its starter home, and replace it later. So, people moving around can and should also put pressure on prices, as everybody wants or need due to loans to sell for profit. From what Ive gathered, fewer homes are being built, and the ones being built, are more expensive ones. Now, for those thatd say what do I know Im not American, I invest my money in the USA markets as I think its the best place to invest in therefore i need to be plugged in with whats happening over with you guys, that doesnt mean USA is without fault. I genuinely hope that Americans will be able to solve their housing price problems, as I think its totally fucked that you need to be a debt salve to a bank for 30 years if you want to buy a house.

Slate roofs, Stone homes, made the last generations. The United States basically creates very nice garden sheds to live in with heating and cooling, oh and usually halfway decent plumbing. A lot of things in the United States are based on some very good idea 100 years ago. Even many of our cultural customs. So over here, when the country was first being developed, there is an excess of timber, it made sense because you could put up a stick built home really quick. The tradition continued and the profits have been immense for all the home builders. Its not really sustainable because a lot of the things that go into a home especially these stupid asphalt roofs dont have a long life and they use a lot of resources to create. Its also a lot of lost money. It takes more skill, more time, so on and so forth to build a European style home. America is basically a giant corporation and these are our worker quarters The only thing youre a little wrong on is the HOAs. Those were actually designed to reduce the load on the local municipal government. It shifts the burden back to the homeowners to take care of the properties. So you create a board of unpaid people to manage how homes should look and cleanliness and other various tasks that used to be on the county government. This is not to help the homeowner, its so the government can spend less on things that municipalities used to do"

There is not a single private data provider in the marketplace which implies anywhere near that. In fact, private data providers might only have one or two metros nationwide with shelter inflation that robust in late 2024. At this point, shelter inflation is basically just tracking the CaseShiller home price index YY. That does not make sense. Also, if shelter is really still inflating at that rate, the only possible remedy is a major recession to completely obliterate home values.

Land inof itself isnt a positive see also TRC. Produce is a commodity and agribusiness like this is inconsistentvolatile. Water rights are a plus. If you have land and you dont have great management and there isnt some sort of end goal to monetize the whole thing, youre going to have a stock that looks like this or TRC is another, similar example. For all the Ackman presentations and various discount to NAV stories about Howard Hughes HHH over the years, its still way under where it was when there was the Baby Buffett Forbes cover story from 2015 about Ackman potentially turning it into his Berkshire. Real estaterelated companies like the above three that are real estate companies with a mix of assets and that arent REITs often have difficulty attracting an audience and for all the look at the land! they continually trade at some degree of a discount. I think Ive read dozens of HHH sum of the parts thesis reports over the years and yet, after all that, it wasnt bought by Brookfield or Blackstone, its Ackman who has been the one buying it up in the last year or so and maybe he eventually does turn it into his Berkshire, but if thats the case the purchase price will still probably be under where it was when that article was written. Nothing against it and hope you do well, but this has basically been volatile within a range for almost 20 years. IMO, that will most likely continue to be the case as a public company they need to look at a sale. As a public company, all of the assets will likely continue to trade at a discount detailed discussion of NAVdiscount here , so best case at this point is a compelling sale to someone else. As that link notes, being a public company the only reason why they became a public company in the first place was because they eventually had enough shareholders to require reporting hasnt really benefitted it much. The CEO who has been the CEO now for 20 years said pretty much the same last year when it was announced that they were looking at strategic alternatives The value the market perceives we have versus what we believe is the intrinsic value theres always been a big difference between those two things, said Harold Edwards, who has been Limoneiras CEO since 2004. The idea is that maybe theres a better way for us to operate. Maybe theres a better ownership structure that isnt public. Maybe its private, or maybe its merging together with another public company. TLDR As a public company, the next 10 years will probably resemble the last 10 years. Its better off as a private company and if they can get a good offer, some of the value that has been discounted in this for eons will be unlocked. That said, the strategic alternative discussion started late last year and has been reflected to some degree in the move that has occurred this year. If a sale doesnt happen, this is going to go lower again."

Below 140 I would start treating it as a leverage BTC play again. But thats all short term. Long term, I think COIN will replace a lot of the functions of traditional banks.

If Solana were the currency people used, for instance, I could send Solana right now, any amount, as many times as I want, to anyone I want, for fractions of a cent. And they would get it instantly. And it will be fully recorded and trackable forever. I work in real estate and dealing with fiat currency is a constant headache by comparison. To pay bills in the amounts and frequency I need I have to use my banks billpayACH system which costs 25 per transaction, takes 36 days to process, and only processes during banking hours. My only access to the history of those transactions if I need it is within whatever limitations my bank puts on their online reporting sometimes as little as 30 days depending on the bank. If my bank doesnt like where Im sending it to or how often Im doing it they can just decline to let the money be sent, at any time, because they feel like it. ZelleVenmo arent real things here, as they are just essentially loans from banks that cover the processing time of the actual transfers, and from a feasibility standpoint if youre moving around money frequently or in high amounts ZelleVenmo will shut you down real fast or put cooldown periods on your account where you cant use it for a few weeks. Were talking about a few thousand dollars here. And god forbid I need to transfer 6 figures or more not uncommon in real estate. Then Ive got to go into the bank, during banking hours, and show ID. All of this to access and move around my own money.

One of the only cases where crypto kind of has some uses is to avoid taxes when sending money to people in shitty countries I live in one. People here sometimes take payment in crypto so they can then cash it via some random crypto exchange, they dont pay any taxes and even if fees are high its still worth it. Of course, the use case here is based on committing a crime, if they didnt avoid taxes it wouldnt be worth it. A reality most people need to accept is that if something hasnt seen major adoption after almost 2 decades theres a reason for it, and thats that it fucking sucks."

Also, way to ignore every part of the comment except the last clause of the last sentence. I agree that you should drill down into the portfolio of a REIT before investing in it. I do this to come up with estimations of future vacancies. For example, if a major company in the portfolio went through a downsizing andor is still fully remote, I put them at a high probability of not renewing. On the other hand, if the company is stable and has returned to office, then I put a low probability on vacating, and instead project a 20 reduction in FFO upon lease renewal based on the assumption that the lease will be negotiated and concessions would be made. You appear to be greatly overstating the return to office and conversion to residential trends. There are very few workplaces that still offer 100 remote work that didnt do so before the pandemic. Conversion to residential isnt super common, but a LOT of vacant office properties have been demolishedsold off to developers to be made into something else."

He wrote an article saying the Fed should do 50bps cut last Friday. I highly doubt its a tip from the Fed, and more just him expressing his opinion in an article he wrote. Its very unlikely that Powell will be able to convince all the FOMC hawks to agree to a 50 bps rate cut, and Powell definitely doesnt want to see dissent votes on the first Fed cut, just 2 months before an election. He wants to be able to defend the Fed decision if he gets pressure by Trump, and a decision with dissents doesnt really make it easy to do that."

As the market realizes the smaller cut, bond prices could decrease, allowing you to profit from the short position. If you expect a 50 bps cut and bonds are too cheap Buy Bonds Go Long If youre certain that rates will be cut by 50 bps, and bonds are currently undervalued too cheap, bond prices are likely to rise after the announcement. You can go long on bonds, expecting a price increase. Using Leverage Leverage allows you to amplify returns. If youre confident in your prediction, you can use leverage to increase your exposure to the trade. However, keep in mind that leverage also increases the risk of losses if the trade goes against you. For example If you expect a 50 bps rate cut and bonds are undervalued, you could borrow money to buy more bonds than you could with your own capital. When bond prices increase, your returns will be multiplied based on the leverage used. Similarly, if you short bonds expecting a 25 bps cut and prices fall, leverage can increase your profits from the price decline. Risk Considerations Certainty Be cautious about being 100 sure of rate cuts, as central bank decisions can be unpredictable. Misjudging the rate cut could lead to significant losses, especially if using leverage. Market Reactions Sometimes, even when you predict the rate cut correctly, the market may have already priced it in, or there may be other factors influencing bond prices. Always consider these potential risks. By timing your trades based on rate cuts and leveraging your position, you can potentially generate large returns. However, proper risk management and a solid understanding of bond market dynamics are essential."

The bull case for NVIDIA, despite the potential cracks in the AI scaling hypothesis, remains compelling due to a number of factors 1. AI Beyond Scaling Diversification of Architectures While the scaling hypothesis may face limitations, NVIDIA is not solely reliant on larger models for growth. The shift towards diverse architecturessuch as edge computing, federated learning, and more efficient, adaptable modelsstill heavily depends on advanced hardware. NVIDIAs innovation in custom AI chips and specialized GPUs for varied workloads ensures that it continues to dominate, even as the industry pivots away from pure scale. 2. AI Software Ecosystem NVIDIAs CUDA platform, AI software stack, and Deep Learning SDKs offer essential tools for AI developers. These tools are deeply integrated across the AI research and enterprise ecosystems, which means that even if scaling slows, NVIDIAs software dominance secures its position as a key player. Moreover, AI companies are dependent on NVIDIAs endtoend platform, from training to deployment, and this dependency is unlikely to change even if the emphasis shifts from scale to smarter, more efficient architectures. 3. Enterprise and Data Center Expansion Even beyond researchdriven AI, enterprise adoption of AI is growing rapidly. Companies across industriesfinance, healthcare, and logisticsare integrating AI into their operations, and this trend fuels continued demand for highperformance computing HPC solutions. NVIDIAs foothold in data centers is a major asset, as demand for AIpowered insights and automation continues to grow. The company is positioned to benefit from AIdriven automation, which is expected to scale massively in the next few years. 4. AI in Autonomous Systems NVIDIAs leadership in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and other AIdriven automation solutions offers another strong growth avenue. The companys Drive platform for autonomous driving and its investments in industrial robots and AIpowered edge devices place NVIDIA in a favorable position as automation accelerates across multiple industries. 5. Gaming and Virtual Worlds Metaverse While AI remains the main growth driver, NVIDIAs core business in gaming is still robust, and its investment in the metaverseparticularly via its Omniverse platformis positioned for future growth. The convergence of AI, VR, and GPUpowered graphics in virtual worlds will open up new revenue streams, ensuring that NVIDIAs hardware remains in demand across various sectors beyond traditional AI use cases. 6. AI Custom Silicon and Competition NVIDIA is investing heavily in custom silicon AIspecific hardware. The Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchip, alongside nextgen H100 GPUs, cater to evolving needs in AI and HPC. These chips optimize AI workloads and enable costeffective scaling, keeping NVIDIA ahead of competitors like AMD and Intel. 7. AI as a Deflationary Force The massive potential of AI to create efficiencies across industries means that the macroeconomic environment will continue to favor companies like NVIDIA. As AI proves its worth in reducing operational costs, improving supply chains, and automating workflows, NVIDIAs role in supplying the necessary infrastructure will keep demand strong. Conclusion Bull Case for NVDA Despite possible challenges to the scalability hypothesis, NVIDIA remains a key enabler of the AI economy. Its leadership in hardware and software, expansion into new markets like autonomous vehicles, and diverse revenue streams provide a strong foundation for continued growth. Even if the AI bubble bursts in some areas, the underlying technological advancements and enterprise applications are likely to sustain NVIDIAs trajectory."

Of course, that now looks very stupid in hindsight really, it was looking possible it was wrong by the time we had FOMC in June, but it was absolutely a thing. Folks got duped by the new year effects twice in a row. Otherwise, these calls are all very wrong and posts like these popping up makes me really hope the record from July is not an intermediate top for the Nasdaq that lasts for a year.

Even the less glamorous companies like Oracle or IBM Id rather be acquired by. ServiceNow even. Unicorns are often tech companies so a even the less popular tech compaines like ServiceNow would provide more resources to take a business to the next level than a retailer with a brick and mortar albatross"

Newer developments would be the Candycon controllers, huge success, they sell out online and in stores almost immediately every restock. I personally have 2, and they are the best controllers Ive used in a long time, high quality. With customizable faceplates, they recently teamed up with Disney to provide limited edition face plates with new game releases. Possibilities are endless when it comes to these. PSA graded sports and trading cards is another huge market they tapped into. eBay literally is selling multiple PSA graded cards every second, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ranging from 15 to 250,000 per card. As a previous eBay buyer and seller, I know the pain when it comes to dealing with eBay and the scammers out there, so that development is looking promising. Just one last thing to add, Ryan Cohen doesnt get paid a salary, nor given stocks or bonuses to work a fulltime job as CEO. He is heavily invested into GME with his own money, so that alone shows that he is 100 dedicated to the company. Do you know of any other CEO who has done this? Share price has already gone up 2000 since Ryan bought in. Hes the CEO now... Im not sure whats next, but Im looking forward to whatever may come!"

Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base. This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that dont exist. Is it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, its true.

People stating that the absence of action is evidence of no plan existing can assume at their own peril. For investors that are dialed in, this was another step in the right direction regarding the chief concern for the companys health they continue to contain the negative impact of the legacy business. A profitable Q2 means more evidence that money is flowing in the proper buckets. The gaming space may not be where GameStop ends up when all is said and done, which is why DFV referred to it as a legacy business in his livestream as well. I have other reasons, but my biggest one is that this company is about to have 5B all cash and it has one of the firmest brand presences on earth.

Something else worth noting, which has interestingly been omitted from this post headline is that GameStop posted Its first Q2 profitability, a notoriously bad quarter for the retailer, in years. That was only possible because of the dilution of the float. It wouldnt have been profitable if not for the interest earned on that giant pile of cash. Of course, thats a double edged knife. Declining revenue is not good for a large retailer. Avenues of profitability have to be opened at some point. But at the same time, it proves that GameStop doesnt even need to be profitable in its business dealings to post profits. What an insanely bullish position to be in, when the actual turnaround of the company hasnt even begun yet."

Says the one that gets all defensive and upset when people talk critically about your favourite video game pawn shop... your lack of selfawareness fits in well with your lack of financial sense."

They have opened up pilot stores with LAN gaming lounges. They have entered into branded partnerships less than a year ago with manufacturers of game emulators and headphones.

I never said anything of the sort. Diluting does increase the value of his investment. GME is worth its cash on hand. Maybe a little more, maybe a little less.

Over two years 1H24 to 1H22, net income of US public nonfinancial companies declined by 1.5 at par and fell by 7.9 on an inflationadjusted basis. Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading Amazon factor, profits collapsed 18 at par and 23.3 when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 36003800 range with a break to 3500 points 1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24. Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success the difference in capitalization now and then. Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality its stagnation with a downward slope on a high base. This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that dont exist. Is it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, its true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports Trading 10.7 yy and 43.5 for 2Q24, and for 1H24 11.6 yy and 44.2 for two years further in the sequence shown.

Spotify Swedish was the number one music steaming service with pretty much a monopoly at some point. Apple is the only one competing. Why? Because they can bundle with their dominant phone position. You see this a lot, where large dominant companies start bundling, pushing their own services or simply take a loss for years and years to push others out. This is a massive factor worldwide that prevents proper competition with these massive tech companies now from new and local players. Its no coincidence the only other country that is able to make massive tech companies is China, the one that decided to just lock out US firms in this space."

This is the behavior our government apparently wants to punish? Now granted, the demand for Nvidias GPUs came on so suddenly and in such an overwhelming amount that the company had to pickandchoose who got allocation that the company may have preferred companies it was invested in, or who only bought from Nvidia, or who were willing to host DGX cloud is hardly a crime its the reward for building a product that people want. Its nuts to me that the DOJ is even considering this case. ....Huang and Nvidia made a massive bet on the future, they were right, and because they were right with no other meaningful change in their strategy our government wants to investigate them.

Nvidia locking the software and hardware bundle? Do they expect Nvidia to pour millions in making Cuda work natively across all architectures including competitor ones? Nvidia isnt really preventing competitors to write their own drivers or translation layers for cuda applications in fact, theres two projects for that, ZLUDA and SCALE. The real question here is why competitors havent spent more money for having their hardware make most of the the ML software stack? Like alternative backendslibrariesdrivers for anything from Pandas to whatever. They have slept for a decade while Nvidia was gifting their GPUs to any research laboratory asking for it, it was only natural most of the ML research was built on Nvidias stack. Im not sure whether Nvidia is now cornering customers with monopolistic behavior and I dont fully believe it either. They should obviously leverage their position, but no ones preventing Microsoft from having a huge deal with AMD or Intel and rewriting whatever they need in the stack to work better with that hardware. Nvidia did pull already such shit in the past think of physx and their lame excuse that it could only run on their hardware, when it run on CPUs mostly anyway and some other stuff. But why should they have the incentive on opening their software stack to competitors? Again, there are both financial and technological incentives for third party players to provide their own libraries. MLAI isnt magic, its really just about lots and lots of matrix calculations."

It might be tricky initially, but I dont think it will be a problem in the long term. In Arizona, we will comply with local regulations and pursue similar industry design standards for water management. Two important aspects of our approach are water recycling and water reclamation At startup, approximately 65 of the water used in the Arizona operation will come from TSMCs inhouse water recycling systems. The recycled water will be used in systems such as our air scrubbers and cooling tower systems. To achieve our goal of 90 water reclamation, We will build an advanced water treatment facility Industrial Water Reclamation Plant at our Phoenix operation with a design goal of achieving Near Zero Liquid Discharge. This means the fabs will be capable of using nearly every drop of water back into the facility. This is a process of converting industrial wastewater into water that can be reused for a variety of purposes."

Intel was behind its competition and had inferior products which put them behind. At least though the company was profitable and had decent cash flow. Now it doesnt even have that. When Gelsinger took over in the beginning of 2021 he basically said he wanted Intel to be a company that both designs chips and manufacturers them. He was extremely optimistic to investors about that plan and started making announcements of building big factories in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon, Germany, and other places. In their original forecast in 2021 Intel said that the factories would start being constructed in 2021 and be built in late 2025 and start producing. The main problem came that not even Intel foresaw was a complete earnings collapse. All of the money was basically going to capex to develop these factories and nothing was really going towards their existing products. Intel fell even further behind and their products became more undesirable and competitors moved even further ahead. It came to a point where margins collapsed and they are basically giving away their products for a small to no profit. They also took a massive loss on their chip fab machines cause they were crap so now they have to write them off and buy new ones from ASML. Now cause of the earnings collapse they have even less money to put towards these factories and have to use every financial trick in the book to get money to fund these. One they have been using is debt. Debt has ballooned but you can only take on so much debt. Another is issuing shares. Intel has been issuing shares quite substantially but that will only get you so far especially when your stock is selling off and not desirable as is. Another is selling their ownership stakes in their factories and spinning off other assets. They basically dumped Mobileye and now they want to dump Altera. Construction was also delayed and now Intel is saying that the factories now wont be ready until 2028 at the earliest. That also assumes no more delays. So their financial situation is only getting worse and worse and the fabs are not expected to have results until 20282030. Gelsingers plan only put Intel into an even worse spot then they were already in. Their financials have been the worst in decades, their stock price is at its lowest point in a long time, his promise of having results are looking even more bleak. Its not good."

All this did was increase AMD chip sales and accelerate the switch to Linux for servers Thought that mobilelow power computing wasnt important, ignoring it for years before the iphone came out and made them realize maybe they should take it seriously. Then instead of focusing on a low power chip, theyt tried to make some x86 behemouth that no one wanted Saw IOT coming, released a few interesting chips, and completely shat the bed on software support. Getting an OS up and running literally took hours of work and that was just bootstrapping the stupid things. They continued the bs where there all sorts of proprietary hooks so it was damn near impossible to make work with common toolchains. Realized general purpose computing was a dying trend for cloud providers and learned that many were switching to custom IP blocks and other solutions. So, they purchased Altera and then did jack shit with the purchase. A few years later, they sold the company at a loss. Literally screwed over their major cloud partners MUTIPLE TIMES over multiple generations of chips. We had Intel lie to us that they sold a competitor chips with an additional core like we wouldnt find out. We had them lie to us for over a year about a major silent data corruption bug. They famously had numerous security bugs that severely impacted performance and they flat out refused to characterize the performance impacts or let us do the characterization ourself. Created a GPU divisionchip about 10 years after everyone else in the industry realized how important memory bandwidth and high core count architectures would be for cloud computing. When they launched the GPU, they focused on gaming, with no clear advantage in price to compete with AMD or performance to compete with Nvidia. Heres the real issue with Intel. Their leadership is full of perpetual fart smellers. The company is full of people who think they are Gods gift to engineering and if a product isnt successful, its the markets fault for not realizing their genius."

I work every day but if I need to go run errands in the middle of the day I go do it. I dont even ask. If I want to take a brief nap I just do it.

If I am not a morning person I am generally free to do very little in the morning other than a few meetings and basic communication and then I can use my best hours 300pm 800pm to do tasks that require my brain like coding and writing terraform for distributed infrastructure and testing out new ideas I have that will help the team. Also, do you care about promotions? I only care about raises...who the fuck cares about a title rofl? I tell companies I work for that they can call me a data janitor if they want as long as they pay me what I want. Literally nobody cares about titles. Ive interviewed tons of engineers and not even a single time have I ever given a fuck what their title was at their last job...I care about how they think and problem solve and if that fits in with what our team needs. I dont need a mega rockstar senior ninjaneer...I need a talented motherfucker that has a slightly sarcastic bad attitude because they have done linux adminautomationcoding for years and get it and can just get shit fucking done. If somebody made a big deal about what title they will be given or keep harping on their past title like it makes them special I assume they arent that good because nobody good actually gives a fuck about that shit. we just want to be paid for the work we do and paid well.

If these bottlenecks elevate or are not scaled up soon, NVIDIA would have to lose out on revenue 2. Power infrastructure Blackwell run data centers are power guzzlers. On the demand side hyperscalers, things are still not figured out as to how exactly will this power be supplied at scale. So any misses on power infrastructure build out might cause some risk as well"

Weve barely seen 1 hardware generation so far, and to suggest the nth limit is at 2nd or 3rd generation is... very likely incorrect. Model collapse theory isnt even strong as synthetic data is already useful for distillation at worst, selfplay at best. My thesis for NVDA is very simple Machine learningaccelerated computing MLAC is extraordinarily powerful, more so than anyone thought for the preceding decades before chatGPT the Alexnet surprise was met with criticism of the dataset well before acceptance of the methods, and that is already over a decade ago. MLAC outcomes are directly associated to scale nothing exciting happens at small scales, everything we will ever want is behind scalewalls read Suttons The Bitter Lesson. MLAC infrastructure at SOTA scales is an extraordinarily hard problem from every angle processingdesign, heat, energy, networking, manufacturing, assembly, etc. Those who wish to leverage the capabilities of MLAC and DO NOT want to deal with the infrastructure problem vastly outnumber those who would welcome the challenge basically only Mag7 will consider it, and the markets those who DO NOT want to deal with it are trying to address are essentially infinite cant list and count markets that dont exist and could never exist without the new technological capabilities MLAC unlocks. And NVDA has owned this moment not due to luck at least not due to luck to the extent that those who call them lucky believe Jensen et al have been squarely focused on this no later than alexnet and they used this conviction to spend serious manhoursresources developing for 0billion dollar markets. Cuda, omniverse, isaac lab, drive sim, etc. So when you consider the tangential opportunities this nextgen MLAC is growing towards we can just choose robotics as one example you have all these firms competing at the edge to be the first with the best solution dropin bluecollar replacements as the TAM of these applications is on the order of 100BT, NVDA is the only viable option, with all others requiring further efforts on the enduser that are irrelevant to their problem. Theres a reason pretty much every newly minted robotics firm is using NVDA robotics platforms. This is exactly why Google still buys so much NVDA they are squeezed by their endusers who demand the platforms NVDA has developed as the maturity of the platforms is directly related to the rate of progress they can make. If Google had the same ecosystem around their TPUs I would not be nearly as singularly bullish on NVDA as I am. NVDA is so far ahead here that even their competitor AMD isnt competing with them look at the earnings growth deltas between these two over the last 2 years it is an empircal truth the best kind of truth in MLAC. And for AMD to seriously compete, they would need to operate in a manner antithetical to how they operate read theyd need to spend billions on software development that their earnings cannot support. The reason AMD wins most console bids is the same reason they dont have the ecosystem they are a bargain option for those willing to do more software leg work. And there are a lot more opportunities than LLMs and Robots just try and count them. If matrix math is really the secret sauce here, the winner in the chip space will be whoever has the most plush redcarpet all the way to the endusers. And it will be a compounding win for at least 35 years due to the complexity of even existing in the space."

If they shrink those margins for a reasonable cost to themselves their share price will likely take off once their investors see cap ex either going down or getting more for their money.

Even if capex spending stopped growing next year, Nvidia is looking at 150b per year revenue with 75 margins. Not bad. Btw, this is already being priced in by Wall Street. This year the forecast is 100 year on year growth, dropping to 50 next year, then 15 in 2026. No one is expecting perpetual hyper growth. On the flip side, any growth above expectations would be a tailwind for Nvidia. 2. Big tech are able to afford massive capex on AI because they are insanely profitable. Cutting capex would just go to their bottom line, resulting in a higher dividend, more stock buy backs, or more investment. Not bad either. People keep making circular arguments about Nvidia when their time would be better spent reading the financial statements of the involved principals. One last point assuming Capex plummets, Nvidia is sitting on a pile of cash and can just buy back stock to prop up its valuation until spend increases again."

Ai has not been over invested because its literally currently changing the world and how people work and do things around the world, you probably only think its funny generated texts images videos and thats is buggy but its not and I cant prove it to you in this answer, you will have to search for what ai is doing thats revolutionary on Google note I use ai every day at my job and its day and night.

What also remains is the question why you would put a multiple this high in your estimate. Your reasoning is that its a typical multiple for NVDA, but naturally one would expect a lower multiple as growth eventually will show signs of slowing and growth potential will get smaller. As I said, your estimates would put NVDA at a 5.5T market cap, and theres only so much growth that is actually possible.

The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors.

The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years.

Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way."

If youre familiar w the enterprise software space, that is very rare, almost unheard of. 3. Theyre making good choices with their acquisitions. Theyre not quite there on BI dashboarding yet, but theyve effectively created a fully integrated vertical data stack that you can move into piecemeal. Their approach encourages you to use multiple pieces without tripping the vendor lockin fears that can hold up projects. 4. Their GenAI approach includes multiple model options, including their own. That will make them less fragile as the space matures. Their differentiator is how theyre defining hooks to feed warehouse data into GenAI wo a lot of wrangling. Overall very happy with the selection 1yr in, and I dont see an obvious path for SNOW to reclaim momentum within the space."

If youre a global company, I find it unlikely youre successfully running on BQ or Fabric at scale although the technology on both has improved. I read from an insider that Google are actually shifting away from BQ product investments to focus fully on AI which is good for SNOW. Regardless, GCP and Azure are far behind in the cloud race compared to AWS. Completely agree on SBC. Slootman ruined the progress and momentum of the company with this and bad hiring. 10x revenue valuation is tiny in the big dataAI space so I dont get the concern there when they are on the high side of growth rates and customer satisfaction. Also, they havent projected their new product revenue into their guidance yet. This could add an additional 100M to revenue this year. Might not be a moonshot but its certainly not the downfall of a company like the short sellers want you to believe so you sell the stock."

Today I sold the 57 put with the 823 expiration date. I got 0.37 in premium and the trade lasts one week. So I divide the 0.37 in premium by the 57 strike and I get 0.0065. Then I multiply that by 52, because Im risking the money for one week, and I could do a trade similar to this on this or another company 52 times over the course of a year. And I get an annualized return of 33. Im doing this with one tranche of what Im willing to put into OXY, and I already have three tranches of OXY with a total cost basis of 52.74 per share. This put option reduces my cost basis down to 52.62 per share. If I get assigned the shares at 57 Ill collect the dividend on 910, then sell a covered call at the 57 strike. Heres an example"

My general thesis is just everyone is wrong about inflation, and we are careening into outright deflation, as a result of the yield curve being inverted for this long, destroying dollars as people pay their debts back, that other people need to pay their debts like a game of musical chairs, and therefore there should be eventually massive defaults and unemployment, and thus deflation. Because The Fed uses the unemployed as a buffer stock unemployment must go up, that is The Feds job. With this much public debt, as interest rates go down, that income that will go away will be bondholders income which will be deflationary, and no one will want to borrow still probably now simply because prices are still just crazy, and we will have to start bailing out entities on the fiscal side, so the trade will go fast. Also The liquidity trap Tldr inflation will probably be a nonissue, although, fiscal policy could really screw things up for this trade, which seems to be the case. The only thing I got lucky on was that I mostly loaded into FRNs as a hedge which seems to have been almost the right move outside of prehaving a bunch of Ibonds back then before moving on it or Id be straight fucked, I was far too early, and really believed they would never actually raise rates, and just keep threatening to lol. But now that rates have gone up, and are now finally coming down, things have only actually gotten crazier and crazier. So who knows. I was also trying to barbell a portfolio of bitcoin and 30 year treasuries to min max returns, they moved far more correlated than I had liked they wound up both going down, though at one point I could have sold my bonds for more than my bitcoins had dropped, I should have just took the 15 arbitrage and left the trade then, Im now down 50 on my TLTBTC trade, at least the gains have outweighed the losses the bonds though, and the interest on my FRNs eclipsed my losses as well as a function of how glacially long this trade has taken, so it still kinda all worked. All that to say, just buying SPY probably would have been less heartache for pretty much the same result, and much better for my mental health as things just keep getting crazier and crazier. lol Although, maybe matching it with bonds and bitcoins is a feat in itself, who knows."

I dont quite remember the details on that front though to be honest, it wasnt the primary motivation for the trade, the primary motivation is the monetary system is having a persistently hard time maintaining inflation as a result of being broken in some way I suspect too high global demand for dollars relative to the amount we need to actually print and distribute to satisfy the implications of the Triffin dilemma with our position as the global reserve currency. Allegedly when people short things like TLT, I recall it is actually pretty dangerous Ill try to dig up why. I didnt hear no bell. To think it will behave like those did is a fools errand I would implore you to look what was going on with it into the March 2020 crash, it most certainly can behave that way. When people think the world is ending, one way or another, theyll be back, and I will be there ready to sell. It is not natural for the yield curve to be inverted this long."

It is not natural for short term rates to be above long term rates. what next, short squeeze and quadruple witching on TMF ? I assert, the speculators are those shorting TLT and betting interest rates are going to keep going up in line with The Fed holding up the short end of the curve expecting it to normalize, not me. Long term rates must go down, because the monetary system needs more larger longer loans. Im probably not wrong overall, the market is just more irrational and likely more fraudulent than most people expect. Im betting I can stay liquid longer than the market can remain irrational. Shit, Ill sell some FRNs and buy more TLT. My average price is currently only 114.17, I can get it down really easily here. Just another 1000 shares will put it down to 106.79, 5000 would bring me down to 98.40, those are exitable, especially when investors realize how fucked shit is, it is only a matter of time, and it isnt exactly the sort of trade you can chase when it happens. You have to already have the position. Slap those badboys together, and swap them to percent change from a year ago. It wouldnt surprise me if long term rates went to 0 is all Im saying, and neither should you be, it should unwind those who were holding onto cheap mortgages increasing supply of housing although, if it gets as bad as I think, no one is going to want to borrow anyways to relieve those trying to in mass sell, for obvious reasons. They have to go low enough to get people to borrow and spend in a big way, and they have to go much much lower, lower than they were previously to accomplish that I hope. Its also the reason Im not worried about real estate prices or speculators or institutions allegedly buying up houses, I think a lot of people are in for a lot of heartache when their overpriced house isnt worth what they had hoped.

Second thing, if you have a workplace pension or potentially SIPP it might be covered preferentially through the tax treaty between the UK and US, I havent worked this out yet myself. If they are, PFICs might be fine through your pension. Id recommend getting tax advice on this. Third thing, agree with Berkshire Hathaway, agree with people saying pick big stocks in the index. Other options Ive considered is investing in stocks whos returns match the market maybe some listed investment funds?, that way you hold a few assets that mirror the market all be it with a lot more company level risk. Fourthly, would recommend against advice in the comments to invest in the US like a US resident, youll have tax obligations to HMRC if you do that, and UK taxes are higher than US generally. SS ISA is still probably a good option in spite of US taxes Finally, come up with a rebalancing strategy, indexes are great because the companies might change but the market increases, if you invest in single stocks youll need to manage allocations over time."

I have considered using a SIPP to invest, but to be honest I really want to see some of my money before Im 5560 years old and I think my pension contributions currently will give me enough of a payout at that age anyways. Also, I tried looking into how the US treats SIPPs, and there was no clear answer. Meaning to my understanding, its very uncertain how the US treats UK personal pensions. Generally, distributions made out of the SIPP can be taxable in the US found here So if I cant withdraw any money until Im much older and the US taxes it anyways, Im not too keen on opening a SIPP, but I do understand your point. Other options Ive considered is investing in stocks whos returns match the market maybe some listed investment funds? Yes this is my current line of thinking as well. I am confused what you mean by listed investment funds? It was my understanding that I couldnt really invest in any types of funds? Edit Also, Im thinking Berkshire Hathaway is definitely my best bet especially as the lack of dividends simplifies tax even further, but I am unsure how to diversify my portfolio as I dont really want to go 100 into a single stock even if it is more like a fund."

Trust me I want what youre saying to be right, it would make my life a hell of a lot easier. I understand that I may be able to open a US brokerage account and never get into trouble, but the issue is it would technically be an illegal account. Its different when people live and open accounts in the US and move over here. I actually asked about this exact topic on the US Expat Taxes subreddit because my initial plan was to go 100 into total world stock ETF on a US account, here are some of the responses I got Doing this could violate the brokerages terms of service. Under U.S. securities laws, such as Rule 10b5, providing false information or omitting material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of securities is considered fraud and can lead to legal claims and penalties. As a practical matter I cant imagine anyone would actually care. If you claim to be a resident to the brokerage firm and then claim otherwise for tax purposes, that could certainly look sketchy. You will be asked for your residence address for kyc know your client purposes. If you lie and use a friends address, and the back finds out they will close your account. They will likely also close the account of everyone else at that address. Theres no recourse for this courts have held that a bank has a right to refuse business. Dont do it .. youll put everybody in a bad situation. So, Im sure practically Id be fine doing this, but I feel extremely uneasy about putting all of my savings into a sketchy account and Id forever be worried about the IRS coming to charge me penalty fees for things I dont understand. But I do really appreciate your help, and honestly opening a US brokerage account is still one of my top options. My other option being investing in large holding companies such as Berkshire Hathaway as they are essentially single stock ETFs and I could ensure no dividend payout to simplify taxes even further."

If dividends dont inherently add value, why is this the case? Life is not just about numbers. And the differences between dividend payments and stock buybacks involve a great deal more than math. Dividends are usually distributed in a systematic way, and cutting dividend payments is seen as a very bad sign. So, a dividend is in effect a statement by management that they believe the company can perform and continue to deliver into the future. Boeing is a case study. Prior to 1998 investment in new aircraft programs and the companys reputation was seen as a way to protect investors, and the dividend, well into the future. Post 1998 the Jack Welch school that came to control the company was focused on short term results and stock buybacks.

Assumptions like management will always spend money in good faith to maximize earnings are useful if you want to make a world that is spreadsheetcompatible, but massively off the mark from the real world. In the real world management has incentives like getting the stock price to a certain number by a certain time to get a payout, future be damned. Creating unrealistic narratives about future earning to justify or increase PE ratios you know are excessive. Tech is a huge part of the SP500 and these problems are very common in tech. Around the dotcom crash this all got so bad that nobody could give out any dividends at all, for fear of demonstrating that they dont have endless golden geese lined up that the money would be better spent on. These days theyve gotten a little better about this and your Apple, Microsoft, and Google at least pay out a nominal dividend of like 0.51. Investors regularly get their money pissed up the wall like this in tech, when they would have been much better off just receiving it as a dividend than having tens of billions wasted on the metaverse with promises that all life would revolve around this concept in a few years, only to have them say actually never mind its all fake after a few years of stock options vesting at high valuations. Of course, were in the middle of a similar bubble with AI, so this all seems quaint now, but trust me, in a few years there will be a lot of people saying I wish they had just given me the money. So yeah, I like a small dividend, just to maintain a culture that this is my money they are playing with, and if they dont have a good use for it then Ill take it. A lot of this applies to share buybacks as well, although theyre prone to more bad incentives as they work through share price, so management is incentivized to do them even when the stock is already overvalued, and the personal incentives mentioned above etc."

Whether profits are retained or distributed, the firms underlying valuation remains the same. I highlighted the key phrase in that paragraph you wrote. That lines says taxes, law changes, wares, natural disasters, and diseases, and criminal activity are Irrelevant. Clearly that is not the case if you look through history. The resent a pandemic and hurricanes and Russias invasion of Ukraine have all had massive impacts on society and many businesses did not survive. Looking further back Enron was seen as a great investment until it was people discovered that the executives lied about the companies performance and illegally manipulated energy prices in california. A tariff war was initiated by US government in 1929 resulted in in an about 60 drop in trade and the SP500 loosing 13 of it value in about 2 days. Add in WW2 and the economy needed 14 years to recover. That one assumption in the theory make it it invalid. Things beyond the control of the company can quickly turn it from profitable to a money looser and eventually kill the company. Look at the dividend return and capital gains earnings of the SP500 seperately 74 of of the funds performance comes from reinvesting the dividends Only 26 came from capital gains. Clearly the dividends from the index, as small as it is, are important. Clearly the divided irrelevance theory is not a valid theory. this video also explains the problems with the theory."

During your accumulation phase you would be wrong to have any allocation other than a diversified portfolio that is spread between growth and value with some adjustment for whether we are in a Value or a Growth phase in the market. In the Early Accumulation phase you should be heavily invested in equities as you dont much care about down cycles as you have little money at risk. In the late accumulation phase you start to build in a strategy for up and down markets as you now have some principal to protect. In the Preretirement stage you start to worry more about beta and less about alpha particularly if you have done a good job of accumulation. In Retirement your goals are preservation and income, so less beta is more important than excess alpha unless you are late to the party. Assuming you have hit your goals, then joining rdividend and forgetting a growth allocation makes total sense. In that stage assuming a good number, you can use the dividends and leave the kids the equities at whatever value they may have when you are gone.

So in my opinion a minimum portfolio for long term investment t retirement is 50 divided and or bonds and 50 growth with a once per year rebalance so each fund stays at50. If the dividend are consisitan try above 5 you fund will still grow even if capital gains are close to zero. But it capital gains are very good you lock that gain in by investing in dividends.

And maybe I want to keep my equity for the upside, but at a lower effective cost basis. I work in private credit and recapitalize businesses all the time in dividend recap transactions where PE literally takes on expensive debt just to take money off the table. The only benefit for them is derisking their investment by returning capital, they are actually destroying equity value with the debt service but its worth it to them to take money off the table."

In that case they will be exactly identical before tax, and different depending on each countrys tax system, eg in Switzerland where I live theyll be identical because real or estimated dividends are taxed the same. In other countries VWCE may come out on top. I am fully aware of all that. I just prefer VWRL because I want to see that somethings happening. Its psychological."

So if you generate 100m in cash flow a year, a lender will most likely be willing to extend 300 400m or 3 to 4x cash flow. The primary reason being is a company will trade at some much higher multiple say 7 to 20 times depending on business so if youre only lent 3 to 4, you are safely inside a potential EV of the company. Secondarily, the lender wants to ensure you generate enough cash flow to cover the interest expense of the debt. There are other underwriting metholdogies though, multiple on recurring revenue or pure asset based lending against liquidation value of assets are two other common ones"

Ideally you would be one of the key personal and make a salary along with that. It sounds like you have some good skills maybe use some of the 100K to take some business classes so you can learn the basics of what is needed to operate a successful business. Personally I have always worked for myself and never had an employer, but not everyone is okay having that level of risk. The best advice is to start up a small business on the side and transition to doing it full time when you no longer have the ability to work both your other job and run your business. One thing for certain is you need to fit your skills into a business where there is a market for a service or product that you can facilitate. You dont start a business because thats what you know how to do. If there is not a definite need for it you are wasting your time and money."

Move max amount to IRAs each year in both your names so it can grow tax free. Only go Roth when you make too much income to contribute to IRA. The rest of it put in cash investment account from Schwab or some other low cost investment platform literally free to open and get started Also start studying stocks and try 15k in a company you like wait for it to drop buy it and hold till its high.

Im not into making that gamble personally but to each their own. Ive looked into different passive ideas same stuff you mentioned real estate, ecommerce, buy a business and keep coming to the conclusion that the only truly passive side hustle is automatically putting money into an index fund because theres literally no work involved in that.

Too stressful and along comes a pandemic and you are expected to give free housing and pay their utilities, too. Maybe you could try taking care of another kid when youre up to it, and see how it goes, before buying your dream home. School districts are so important and being in a good one is expensive. But, theres a shortage of daycares. You may be qualified to get the new business money, if Kamala gets elected. I wonder if there are any incentives out there to start daycares. Maybe look into the small business bureau in your area. Or the chamber of commerce. In the meantime, I would keep the money in your money market fund or HYSA or even 4week tbills on treasury direct, and set them to keep reinvesting, since you arent sure what to do with it yet.

In tech you can often find higher pay jobs by switching employers comes with proscons who are willing to pay more for your time. Good investments help, but 100K in anything safeish isnt going to say half your time to retirement or anything dramatic like that. You could run a business, but if you werent considering this beforehand receiving your inheritance, how is 100k going to make it any easier or you any more likely to succeed? New businesses are tough, and it requires good leadership, intuition, a lot of consistent hard work. And even then, it may still fail. If that challenge excites you, go for! But my questions would be, why does it excite you more than now that you have 100k? Im not sure where you are in the world, but 100k doesnt go very far in terms of buying a house these days. Im in Vancouver BC and I doubt youd be able to buy or possibly even qualify for a second mortgage.

Like with any investment, you have to accept the risk associated with it. Could you potentially start again from square one if you lose whatever money you invest? If the answer is no, shelf the business venture for the time being. If the answer is yes, then I have a success story to keep you inspired... My uncle moved to Hong Kong when he was 20 during national military service. He moved from a rural village in France with virtually no practical experience in business. Irrespective of this, he started his first business and worked super hard and really believed in his vision, despite being broke for a long time. He failed many times. His relentlessness is something that should be studied. Anyway, one of his ideas paid off and he became the richest French man in Hong Kong back in the mid 2000s. Its absolutely doable. Of course there is a massive amount of luck involved. And I wont quibble with anyone that addresses the fact we live in a different time now, however starting a business and being successful can without a doubt allow you to achieve your dreams. One thing I will say your dream has to be to run a successful business, not just to get rich quick and chill. I spent some time working for him as a kid and observed some of his business practices. The key ones were 1. Take small steps. Seems painfully simple but this is often something people forget to do. They get over excited with an idea and allow themselves to make silly, costly errors. These errors can really take the wind out of your sails and sales. 2. It all comes down to your margins. To be successful every dollar has to be accounted for. Eking out every cent you can in areas which seem frivolous may make all the difference later on. Not putting the hard graft in now will always cost you somewhere down the line. 3. Be lucky! A lot of what running a successful business comes down to is hard work. Its also important to be clever with how you manage several overarching areas of your business e.g funding, costing, manufacturing, if required, marketing, sales etc. But sometimes it does just come down to being in the right place at the right time. Like with my uncle, he was in the right place at the right time and it paid off massively. Of course he might argue he was there by design, so maybe its more in our power than we realise . The trick to this is to always be in a position to take an opportunity in business if it presents itself. To achieve this, you must live and breathe your business. Know your shit and try not to get scammed too many times when starting out trust your gut, youll soon realise if you have the stomach for business or not. This is all anecdotal, of course its not proof that anyone will certainly make it. Its simply a reminder that running a successful business makes it possible. Either way, dont half shoot it. Really tear off a chunk of whatever you decide to do. Theres no use in half arsing it."

But they generally wind up being worse than a REIT and also more complex to own, are illiquid entirely illiquid or limited opportunities to sell and some in the past have gated withdrawals for temporary periods. This seems like it framed itself differently but seems very gimmicky in terms of the kind of things you got and has the same core issues limited liquidity, etc. Never heard of the company mentioned but crowdfunding, EREITs which feel like what were previously nontraded REITs an asset class that lead to a lot of complaints over the years in a different wrapper, stuff like that I just really dont recommend. Edit The site is kind of underwhelming. It focuses on the message which is nice but who is running the operation and what is their background? I see some people listed but no biographybackground. It shows the number of properties it owns in Atlanta but no examples that I can see. Apparently this is some sort of RegA nontraded REIT theres just very little information from an investment standpoint on the website, which is focused entirely on the message really. Id have to really go through filings to try to have a better understanding of the investment yes the message is nice but what do these houses look like? who is running this and what kind of qualifications do they have? the CEO of this was apparently previously CEO of some sort of automotive company?, which imo shouldnt have to be done. What are the specifics of withdrawals, given limited liquidity? Is there the ability to gate withdrawals? It doesnt really say on the website. Looking at one of the filing offerings, theres a long list of risks including our manager and its affiliates have no prior experience managing a portfolio of assets to comply with REIT requirements and detailed conflicts of interest between the manager and the sponsor. Edit finally found it after looking through filings. They intend to limit the number of units to be able to be redeemed during any calendar year to 5 of the weighted average number of units outstanding during the prior year. The manager can gate withdrawals at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason. Theres a lot of other specifics, but its like all the other nontraded REITs yes there is quarterly liquidity, but not if a lot of people try to redeem at once. Again, not really familiar with this beyond just starting to look through filings, but I just think that anything investmentwise needs to have more information than this does on its website. These kinds of offerings sell themselves very basically on their websites but imo theres a lot more to it I mean, just looking at one of the offering filings its nearly 100 pages and theres a lot of noteworthy thingsrisksconsiderations on these filings that should be under an FAQ section on the website itself, not something that people have to go through a filing to find when considering this sort of investment."

So, I gave it the bare minimum investment unit and thought Ill give them a year. I invested in Zekhaus, which is a similar platforminvestment model almost 10 years ago and I have doubled my money, which isnt bad.

That said, since 2022 it just alternates between lagging the sp500 and catching up, then lagging again, rinse repeat. I do hope it continues outperforming the sp500, as it has done historically, but Id rather not bet too much of my portfolio on it. I just could never do a giant move like OP did, all at once. Today, selling at 232, it looks like you dodged some minimeltdown before close, but what if the stock blows up in january after a good Xmas season?

Youd also be taking on uncompensated risk of single country I can pay links explaining this if needed, since both are US only. Theres been plenty of times where it was the US trailing international. Are VTSAX and VFIAX diversified enough for a longterm strategy? Id say no, in fact it is less diverse than VTSAX alone. But even VTSAX, Id pair with VTIAX.

Since you will have enough for your own retirement dont draw from the Roth IRA. Just let it keep growing tax free from the point of contribution. There are no minimum required distributions even when you are well into retirement age so it can keep growing. When either spouse passes it goes to the other but let it keep going. Finally when the last spouse passes the kids can inherit it.... AND THEN they can let it keep growing tax free for another 10 years.

They are young enough that it would provide you with tax benefits on the capital gains. I would put in at least as much as the state tax benefits give you. You could open a custodial account for their gifts. Whenever a grandparent or friends give them cash, you can put some away. After a while their account will grow and it teaches them the value of saving a part of their gift. You could also gift to a trust. This is where the estate attorney comes in. Im not sure what trust type is best for your family. Maybe a grantor trust. In any case whatever you gift them is out of your estate. In 2026, the lifetime exemptions change and will most likely be halved unless congress does something. If that were to occur it makes sense to move money out of your estate now and let the returns compound outside of your estate. Depending on how much money youre saving you could easily pass the lower lifetime exemptions. Of course if you spend most of your income this wont be a problem. I would recommend for you to avoid getting advice on Reddit lol I know Im on here. Go hire a professional financial advisor and a trustestate attorney. It will be worth the money.

He gets us is a prime example of it. AI can take complex data and be able to create a dangerous conversion rate boosting sales and revenue.

I dont know their model well though but revenue growth is worth the risk. It still could go to 0 or be 10 but Google hasnt had to handle competition outside of how YouTube has handled it.

If everything is valued perfectly fairly, AKA if the market is perfectly efficient, then the best investment is going to be a total market index fund weighted by market capitalization. When people deviate this by overweighting certain funds, sectors, or stocks, basically what theyre doing is betting that they see a market inefficiency where others do not. Theyre betting that their decision will help them outperform the total market index fund basically. So if you have a specific reason to think that something is undervalued and you know something that other people dont, then thats the nature of stock picking. Most people suggest against it though, since they say statistically most people suck at it. A large part of investment is measuring potential risk, which can be difficult. Lets take as an example the total stock market index versus the SP 500 index. The total stock market index has an 80 overlap with the SP 500, because the SP 500 is the top 80 of the total market. That means that if you invested half in a total market and half in the SP 500, you would be overweighting the top 80 of the market. This actually slightly reduces the diversification of your investment, theoretically introducing uncompensated risk."

To be honest, I dont know how much to put into each but I do want VOO to have the biggest percentage You have tons of overlap with zero international coverage and little to no US extended market. Factor investing would actually favor small caps and value, not large and growth, for long term investing. I understand VTI is more diversified but I dont see how that matters as VOO has been slightly outperforming it. While large caps have favored US large caps, that isnt always the case and long term smaller caps actually come out ahead. I get the concept of overlap, but Im still unclear on why its considered a drawback It may make it hard to understand the weight of everything youre invested in for one. whether I should aim for more diversification. I would. In addition to what I mentioned above, theres plenty of times where favor is outside the US. Are there any YouTubers I should check out that arent a getrichquick channel type?

Both of these assumptions, common in academic finance, fail to a meaningful extent in practical reality. Volatility is not risk. Risk is likelihood of permanent capital impairment, which prevents you from achieving your goals. Path dependency on the way to an outcome is irrelevant if you have no liquidity needs and your assets are not going to get wiped out to 0. Over a 2030 year period, who cares if I experience more volatility if Im compounding at 10? Id argue volatility is the price of achieving excess returns and should be welcomed, not viewed as some proxy of risk and thus minimized. As for the correlation point, this is both less true than often stated just observe crisis periods when correlations go to 1.0 and, for the needs of long term investors, not very relevant for the same path dependency reason cited above. A 100 bond portfolio for a young investor planning for eventual retirement is astonishingly risky, because they probably wont achieve their goal. Its not somehow low risk just the squiggly lines dont squiggle up and down as much as other assets do."

I agree with most of what you say but think its misses the point of the concept slightly, if you dont like the use of the word risk here then replace it with volatility exposure and the points still stand. The information is still valuable in that it provides information on how volatility is not directly linked to expected return and that balancing a portfolio in different ways can allow for similar returns with less volatility exposure. This is a good thing to understand. The trade off of increasing expected return in exchange for volatility exposure is not always 11. The point is not to minimize exposure to volatility completely, or even to maximize return vs exposure to volatility. It is to find out how to minimize your exposure to volatility given a desired expected return, and the mechanisms with which people do that. Its an explanation of why people incorporate bonds in a portfolio, Im not telling people they should. Its also the advice echoed in The Intelligent Investor as well as Warren Buffet, and the subject of a lot of research. So its quite a bold claim to dismiss it as nonsense."

Classical cryptographic methods work well, and we have alternative classical methods for those that could be broken by a general purpose QC eg those based on Prime numbers. IMHO the interesting application is Quantum Annealing. Global solvers are useful in pretty much every industry you can think of. So Im tempted by firms like Dwave NASDAQQBTS. However, Dwaves current tech only solves a very specific subset of objective functions quadratic forms over binary variables, and further, theyve only got about 5000 qubits at this point, so they have not yet reached the scale where they can offer something that a Classical computer can not. So the price could go down quite a bit before going up, and if some other player has breakthrough, then it might never go up. I guess an ETF isnt a bad idea if you want exposure to the sector, because IMHO it is difficult at this stage to pick who will be the winners and the losers. If eg latest crop large language models started using an architecture that could be phrased as quadratic forms over binary variables, then Id be buying Dwave in a heartbeat, but as it stands, I still havent seen that killer application to warrant a purchase."

Here are a handful of links I found helpful investingforaliving.us20170616mappingthetopeconomicindicatorsjune2017 I used Python and the FRED API to pull and analyze data, fit classification models and evaluate which data provided most accurate recession predictions. In the end I used individual logistic regression models on each economic data signal, then aggregated the individual model output into a ensemble logistic regression model for an overall prediction of current recession probability. Logistic regression models have a naturally probabilistic output signal and you can shrink the coefficients of the model to make it less certain to reduce impact of overfitting. One of the biggest hurdles in this kind of modeling is that data publication is significantly lagged and that initial data releases are often revised multiple times up to a year after initial publication. But you can access original release dates and original release data using ALFRED through the FRED API and run historical backtests with actual publication lag and data in the state of revision that would have been actually known at the time. Also, you have to be extra careful with how some data is recorded by FRED. For example, Q1 data is often recorded with a date of January 1 start of Q1 but is actually published weeks or months after the end of the first quarter AprJune. If you use the dates as is without adjusting for actually publication date you are essentially peaking into the future by 36 months. You can build a model that seems to work really, really well in backtest but in reality you would need a time machine for it to work in realtime. My model uses the following data series UNRATE, ICSA, CCSA, PAYEMS, USCONS, RRSFS, CSCICP03USM665S, IPDCONGD, INDPRO, GACDFSA066MSFRBPHI,AWHMAN, HTRUCKSSAAR,PERMIT, MSACSR, HOUST, T10Y3M, T10Y2Y, NFCI, ANFCI, NFCICREDIT, NFCIRISK, NFCINONFINLEVERAGE, SP500."

This report is crucial for gauging AI demand, especially as AMD competes with Nvidia in the GPU market. Key highlights include expectations of record data center revenue at 3.52 billion, bolstered by demand for AMDs Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. The recent launch of the Instinct MI325X AI chip adds further interest. Goldman Sachs notes sustained growth in AI infrastructure spending and a significant rise in AMDs server CPU market share, now at 34. This could be an opportunity for AMD to close the gap with Nvidia, especially if their results align with market expectations also if youre looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation"

Well run, shareholder orientated, have great risk management and tech to back them up etc. Theyre also growing quite well geographically. However, so far this business lives and dies by the interest rates, the vast majority of their incomeprofits come from interest, they stand to lose approx. 350 million per 1 decrease in interest. They would need to massively compensate for the projected decrease in interest rate with commission fees. And I dont think they can grow fast enough in the short term to compensate. Maybe the boost from elections will help in the very short term but I think IBKR is better held for a long time, and I would enter at approx 100 , current price point is too high for me.

JPMorgan analysts told clients after field work and discussions with management, they cut their estimate for VFs fiscal 2025 earnings per share. The analysts pointed to wholesale challenges with The North Face, and ongoing traffic headwinds across brands. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients that after recent fieldwork and management access, they cut their fiscal 2025 earnings per share EPS estimate to 65 cents, which they noted was 35 below the Wall Street consensus. The analysts based that on an 8 yearoveryear decline in revenue, also worse than consensus forecasts. Ill add that Im not saying just because JPM says its bad, its bad. But wanted to get your take on why its not bad. Why not just wait till after Q2 print to buy to see where things shake out. How did you get comfortable.

Corp has experienced fluctuations in its financial performance over the past four fiscal years, showing growth in revenue but facing challenges with declining net income. The companys EBITDA and operating income have varied significantly, while balance sheet metrics have seen declines. Margins and ratios have been mixed, with a notable drop in net profit margin. VFC has faced both positive and negative news in the market and is exposed to diverse risks across operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG factors. Key Financial Insights Revenue increased from 9.24 billion in 2020 to 11.61 billion in 2023 but declined to 10.45 billion in 2024. Net income dropped significantly from positive figures to a loss of 968.88 million in 2024. Gross profit margins remained stable, ranging from 41 to 52. Positive free cash flow in most years, except for 2023. Historical volatility of 58 indicates moderate stock price volatility compared to the market. Risk Factors Operational risks from supply chain disruptions and quality control issues. Regulatory risks related to trade policies, labor regulations, and environmental standards. Macroeconomic risks including economic downturns, currency fluctuations, and inflation. Competitive risks due to industry competition and evolving consumer preferences. Technological risks from cybersecurity threats and the need for digital investments. ESG risks impacting brand reputation and consumer perception. Conclusion Given the mixed financial performance, market sentiments, and diverse risks facing V.F. Corp, it is recommended to hold the stock for now. Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports, risk management strategies, and industry trends before making any significant buying or selling decisions."

I agree that TNF is currently the revenue driver hence this delayed winter in the States could affect sales. But keep in mind 60 of the sales comes from Europe Asia. Only 40 of it comes from the US. One thing this analyst Matthew Boss didnt add in his thesis is the thriving backpacks business of TNF, this and international sales would likely offset the decline in the US. One more thing is that the CEO has already guided TNF revenue downwards for the coming quarter last earnings call. The stock also has retraced since this negative catalyst watch, so you could argue it is priced in. The problem with holding off the purchase because of this one negative catalyst is that when all the other brands show signs of turning Vans, Timbs, Dickies of which the latter two and he announces two more brand sales Jansport Kipling and completely brings us back to optimal capital structure, we would be off to the races, being potentially valued at 1x PS which would be 10B in market cap."

What Vans has that Adidas and Nike doesnt is the relentless support from subcultures punks, alts, creatives, skaters, lgbtq, surfers, etc... And guess what, this portfolio of brands are trading less than an individual brand like Crocs or Birkenstock.

However, challenges in managing cash flow, increasing debt levels, and low liquidity ratios pose risks to the companys financial health. Despite facing operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks, LLY remains a key player in the pharmaceutical industry with opportunities for growth through innovation and expansion. Investors should carefully consider these factors in their investment decisions. Key Financial Insights Strong revenue growth from 24.54 billion in 2020 to 34.12 billion in 2023, representing a 39 increase. Healthy profitability margins with Gross Profit margin at 79.2 and Net Profit Margin at 15.3. Total Assets increasing steadily to 64.01 billion in 2023, reflecting a strong asset base expansion. Focus on revenue diversification, cost optimization, and debt reduction for sustained growth. Operational efficiency improvements and innovation investments are crucial for longterm success. Risk Factors High debt levels with Net Debt growing from 12.94 billion in 2020 to 22.41 billion in 2023. Negative Free Cash Flow in 2023 signaling liquidity challenges. Low liquidity ratios Current Ratio 0.94, Quick Ratio 0.92 indicating potential cash flow constraints. Operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG risks impacting financial performance. Moderate Value at Risk VaR of 0.45 pointing to a moderate level of risk associated with investing in LLY. Conclusion Given the companys strong revenue growth and profitability trends, coupled with the risks posed by cash flow management and debt levels, investors should exercise caution. A hold recommendation is advisable at this juncture, allowing for further monitoring of operational improvements and debt reduction strategies to better gauge the companys longterm financial stability and growth potential."

In the UK. Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is. The value is added by gas centrifuging UF6. Only governments can do that."

That was V C Summer 23, another pair of AP1000s. Westinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt. Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US. Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK. Among nonauthoritarian countries in the last couple of decades, only South Korea has managed to build large nuclear reactors on a reasonable budget and schedule. Id be very wary of all the hype around nuclear, be it uranium, SMRs, or large reactors."

So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid i.e. majority of energy demand then large reactors are the way to go. The actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 57 data centers of 5 GW power each. That would take roughly 35 large power reactors. And they are just talking about what OpenAI wants. Microsoft just struck a deal to reopen a nuclear plant in NY as well."

The completion of Units 3 and 4 made Vogtle the largest clean energy generation site in the US as well as the largest energy generation site of any kind in the US. The cost of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not the correct anchor point for estimating additional AP1000s given costs that should not be incurred again. Vogtle began construction with an incomplete design, an immature supply chain, and an untrained work force the AP1000 design is now complete, there is now supply chain infrastructure, and Vogtle trained over 30,000 workers. The next AP1000s would also realize substantial cost reductions with benefits from the IRA, including the investment tax credit of 3050 and LPO loans for up to 80 of eligible project costs. From page 4th. Notice they modeled the costs of future builds with the AP1000s and not any other design because they are keen on building AP1000s.

Looking at BEPCs Q2 results nuclearWestinghouse revenues are described to fall under the Distributed Energy Storage line item, which was 61 million out of 830 million total 2024 revenue at the time of the report. I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price. Edit 2 So Ive learned in this article on the Westinghouse fraud case that they were paid 600 million for construction work in 201617.. so if BEPC gets 51 of something in that ballpark for multiple units, yeah could be huge for the SP Id imagine...

But the nuclear industry always claims that theyll learn their lessons and the next build will be smoother and on time and budget. And it never is. Basically every plant built in the 70s and 80s in the US had huge overruns, and many were cancelled after TMI. Even Watts Bar took much longer to complete than expected. Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different. This is unfortunately why the nuclear industry, which should be a perfect complement to solar and wind, and perfect for AI, is instead a sunset industry."

I did learn in further reading after this comment though that Westinghouse revenue will no longer include construction work, as some press releases I read excluded that from their business model when discussing the CCJBEPC acquisition. I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company. I wish I would have gone with my gut last month and bought CCJ 60 calls, as those would already be printing now. Instead I stayed on the sidelines smh. Still considering getting in on CCJ now though."

I dont have a specific issue to point to other than to ask why more people in the US arent building AP1000s currently and why the Vogtle units cost so much. Probably a good amount of mismanagement by Westinghouse and their construction contractors but also the costs of complying with regulatory scrutiny are high as well. Given that it is nuclear I think a good amount of scrutiny is warranted but maybe its a little overboard. Maybe the ADVANCE Act will help things along though, remains to be seen."

Its a tangible asset, meaning it has physical presence and cannot be easily devalued like fiat currencies. People trust precious metals during times of financial instability because they retain value over time. Hedge Against Inflation Historically, silver has acted as a hedge against inflation. When the value of paper currency decreases due to inflation, the price of silver typically rises. This is because silver, like gold, tends to hold its value as fiat currencies lose purchasing power. Industrial and SafeHaven Demand Unlike gold, silver has significant industrial demand. Its used in electronics, solar panels, medical devices, and other applications. This dual demand as an industrial and investment metal creates a unique dynamic where silver benefits both from market speculation and physical demand, making it more resilient. Historical Precedent During past economic crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis, silver and gold prices surged as investors sought out these assets to protect their wealth from collapsing stock markets and devaluing currencies.

Especially Aluminium that is influenced by its industry uses growing due to on going wars, weapons, vehicles, missiles, etc. however also influenced greatly by energy prices as the smelting process is very energy intensive. Lower than usual energy prices this year means its cheaper to make increasing demand volatility. Personally I would stick to silver and gold long term as they have historical statistical backing and I would buy aluminium and lead at extreme lows watch RSI and dont hold them for long. Edit The reason I choose silver over gold right now is because it is extremely undervalued in comparison. Higher risk I agree, but high risk higher reward which is what I am looking for with my current portfolio."

They basically doubled in the last week due to chips funding, but they need to execute. Execution primarily involves filling more orders and reducing CapEx, which they seem set up fairly well to do based on recent transcripts Ive readlistened to. They will have slightly higher manufacturing capabilities at the Mohawk Valley fab than they initially predicted. Overall, I like WOLF because they are the most experienced when it comes to making wafers of size. They are currently transitioning their wafer production from 150 to 200 mm, which is a great sign. On a more qualitative note, when I watch their YouTube podcasts, I feel that they get into the depths of the technology which I appreciate because to me, it shows that the scientists and engineers are leading the company. Other companies will for sure offer SiC in the future, but will they have the highest market share, Im not sure. WOLF is primarily focused on making the wafers, while sum companies focus on wafer production and device development. Only time will tell of course, my recommendation is to look into the tech and prepare for a moderately bumpy ride. After two years I project itll double and be around 3035."

Expect big drops of 20 in mid cap stocks and even more in small caps. Within a week. This happens also for the upside like we see this month for a lot of the U equities. That said, there is unbelievable valuation and immense upside to many uranium juniors and business focused on the fuel cycle enrichment etc. This sector moves at a glacial speed, and many stocks do get ahead of themselves. Do lots of homework on companies that are developers of mines. The only producers that need to be considered for a newbie is Cameco, Uranium energy Corp, boss energy and energy fuels. If you want more then look at Sprotts Uranium information on their website. Dont listen to hype on YouTube, X, and other sources. Its a great opportunity to buy a non fungible, scarce and undervalued commodity, but dont expect to make life changing money if you consider yourself an average investor, much of the easy money has been made already in the sitting and waiting. Now is the time to look for value, performance and the companies that are actually going to be able to mine this resources at significant quantities well into the future. Alongside the companies involved in the other services in the sector. This bull market is not a flash in the pan. This time for the nuclear industry, its game on."

On top of that, demand for uranium is expected to grow as China and other nations continue to build nuclear reactors. Prices have been fluctuating, but many experts believe they will rise again due to these supply and demand dynamics. Whats also interesting is how big tech companies are now getting involved. Microsoft recently signed a deal to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power its data centers, while Oracle is building small modular reactors SMRs to fuel its AI data centers. These reactors are expected to deliver over 1 gigawatt of electricity, showing just how critical energy demand has become in powering AI growth. This could lead to even higher demand."

Personally, Im more excited by DoE funded research on converting tailings. All of your cost is in processing ore thats already dug up, and the potential for government funding is huge if you can clean up an area with historic minerelated hazards. Whoever is able to get that first contract in with clear buyin from the government and a new processing technique will cause a new gold rush."

This decays into Protactinium233, which further decays into Uranium233. Protactinium233 can be removed from the liquid salt of a tworegion MSR by reductive extraction into liquid bismuth. Basically a breeder reactor that uses a cheaper and more abundant fuel source. This style of reactor was designed in the 1950s and I honestly believe the main reason this hasnt been developed further is more due to proliferation risks than cost or feasibility. Since the Protactinium233 can be extracted rather easily and would be of high concentration, it would reduce a lot of the work needed to make a nuclear weapon. Mainly removal of neutron emitters and other purification steps to get to 95 purity of Uranium233. Uranium233 is a fissile isotope."

Sure theres a nuclear renaissance currently ongoing but micro reactors are micro e.g. small meaning less required fuel and many are far from being deployed in the coming years. If mines are actually going to reopen then its more than reasonable to assume that theyll open in time before demand surges. Also historically the price of uranium varies between 20120 and this isnt the first time weve had a nuclear renaissance. Realistically, we have near infinite uranium on earth.

Also because of the Olympics Dam Project which along with stupendous amounts of copper and gold has enough Uranium to supply the entire worlds current demand for thirty to fourty years. The mine is running now, can be scaled, and is run by seasoned professionals. Also, BHP is cheapish with a dividend yield of about 5 partly because of a class action suit for a tailings dam failure If you prefer juniors, buy AMLI because I own some of them too and they have a stake in lithium mining in the US as well as a big uranium prospect in Peru."

Have since watched Microsoft, google and Amazon have their positive takes alongside the governments actions to speed up SMRs. Only thing is a lot of stocks have run up pretty big already, I am holding oklo 8 average and over the past couple weeks it has doubled. Still plenty of plays out there but dont be dumb and buy something right after It goes up over 100. Also FYI nuclear energy costs 34x as much as solar or wind, given a large amount of that is bureaucracy still pretty expensive atm."

                    "text": "TL,DR from ChatGPT Summary Uranium Market Report Price Trends Since 2020, uranium prices have surged from 21lb to 106lb in February 2024, currently stabilizing at 83lb. The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected. Uranium Overview Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U238 used in military applications and U235 used to fuel nuclear reactors. U235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal. HALEU and Enrichment Highassay lowenriched uranium HALEU is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives. Supply Challenges Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 1015 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30 by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap. Demand Growth The U.S., China, and France account for 58 of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28 increase in demand from 20232030 and a 51 rise from 20312040, driven by global clean energy goals. Global Production Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43 of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward selfreliance. Investment Insights The report suggests that mining companies are wellpositioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector. Conclusion The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uraniums role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.

It was calculated that 700lbs is the cutoff at which point it becomes uneconomical to keep running the reactors. this is 8x the current price. due to these factors, uranium supply is priceinelastic"

There are over 100 million lbs of enriched uranium used by reactors yearly, so to pump the market in any meaningful way OP would have to buy literally millions of pounds of physical uranium.

And if we create enough windmills to have enough energy in the winter then theyll be sitting on their arses whole summer. It is not a solution for baseline energy it is a complementary solution to the baseline. Then you fill in with renewables and batteries which can also charge from overproduction of a nuclear facility. Furthermore I think energy production should be more decentralized which reduces the scale of some energy plants and makes it more cost effective. See SMR which china is already starting production of. If we can streamline and make the production of it more efficient itll probably even cost less money than all other energy sources."

Theyve been cutting costs, sold their HQ for 50m which hasnt shown on a Quarterly report yet. That will also reduce spend in the future. This will also be the first quarter in which the added revenue from the Overstock dot com relaunch will be included. Youre right, they definitely arent out of the woods yet. A lot of work to do. But from how it looks to me, not even the potential for a turnaround is priced in as of now. Their EPS is negative so PE is null, but the price to sales ratio is like 0.3 now. Market cap is not much higher than a single quarters revenue."

If youre really interested in the companyplay it wouldnt be a bad idea to listen throughwatch the investor conference they had along with this earnings. Im tentatively bullish on the company still. I think Lemonis has a lot of good ideas and has reformed after giving too many overly optimistic projections. He seems to be making much more conservative promises. I think having physical towel stores again is going to be a great thing for the company, letting people out in the world know that the brand still exists. Lemonis bought 1.5m in shares after the earnings reportthe stock tanking, which was by far his largest buyin to date. That unfortunately for me did absolutely nothing to move the stock up. I think the market is waiting for tangible results before theyre going to reprice. Shorts are probably still hoping for the bankruptcy. There was a lot of other bullish news before and after earnings, and again, none of that did anything to positively impact the price of the stock. That said, I think the stock is still highly undervalued even for the current situation. The company has a good balance sheet and other valuable assets. If you take the market cap and subtract their assets then the market is essentially valuing the company at 0. Lmk if you have any other questions though. Happy to chat despite the pain this has caused me. Edit I do also still have a very small position on. Calls for next June and Jan 2026. I think that will be enough time for them to sort their shit out for the online stores as well as have a decent number of physical stores spun up."

Radar and lidar are also capable of detecting and classifying pedestrians either by themselves or as part of a multimodal sensor suite. In fact they can be better than cameras in some circumstances, low light as you mentioned. Some lidars also give Dopplerrelative speed not sure if Waymos does but I know AURs does. Video processing is necessarily a much more resource intensive task than processing lidar or radar data. Now everyone I know that has radar and lidar also has cameras, so that may not be important but there are probably some optimizations that having multiple sensors allows a reduction in the amount of video that needs to be processed. Rapid iteration is not a differentiator, everyone doing self driving Waymo included can push updates whenever they want. Most also use Continuous integration pipelines. Regulatory hurdles are mostly propagandafake news auto companies self certify for safety, other than FMVSS rules which are testable requirements NHTSA can verify. FMVSS rules are very easy to comply with and say nothing about autonomy. There are some FMVSS changes required to remove steering wheel pedals and other things but those changes have been in process for years and should be done soon if it hasnt already happened, not familiar with the latest status. The easy work around is to simply not delete these until the rules change, theres also a waiver process that some companies I believe have successfully completed to delete these components. The real regulatory hurdle is liability, and needing to pay out millions in damages when a court determines your product killed someone and the manufacturer is liable. In other words the only real barrier is tech readiness. Regulatory hurdles are just an excuse that wallstreet types tend to buy."

If you really understand the underlying tech needed for Fully Autonomous Vehicles, you would know that Tesla needs the actual FSD, not the scam they have been selling for years. Also, how is this announcement different from the original Cybertruck announcement and the original FSD announcement which was supposed to run on HW3 and be backwards compatible?

That bubble went close to bust, so China did, what any reasonable regulator would have done and created a giant credit bubble, which it injected into the real estate bubble, in order to stabilize that one. People got loans, which, even if they didnt miss their payments, they wouldnt be able to pay off in their lifetime and their heirs would have to take over. Then Beijing did an actually reasonable thing It tried to let the air slowly out of that bubble. This led to some collapses. Nothing to serious for the system. But the economy slowed down. And cashflows dried up. And money started fleeing the country in trillions. The main reason for this was not the government action, but the Corona lockdown and ripple effects. Those, who still invested in the country chose a secure investment 10 year chinese treasury bonds. They bought so many of them, that the state begun discouraging it, because banks going to long led to the collapse of the SVB and they saw that threat if there was a run on chinese banks. But the economy slowed further and the real aconomic data they saw became troubling. So the state did, what any good state would have done They set up a big stimulus package. And everything was great. Except it wasnt. Because now there was a stock market rally and everyone everywhere who did not want to miss the boat suddenly needed liquidity to buy stocks. And the approximately 4.000 small to mid cap chinese banks who are to long in their investments get in trouble providing that liquidity. So they do, what every good bank does Instead of rolling over the loans they give to local government, they want repayment. But there is an issue. While the central state of China has massive reserves, the local governments are 34 trillion Dollar in debt. And they cant pay. So the central government declares to loan a couple of dozen billion Dollar to local governments. And everybody thinks, thats just another stimulus. And they cheer. And they draw more liquidity from the banks with the 10 year treasuries. To invest in the stock market. Which is financed by the banks. Which hold the bad mortgages. And whose liquidity is locked up. Im not saying China is going to crash. I atill dontwant to believe it. I hold some ETFs myself. But everything I wrote is more or less the case according to various different pieces of financial reporting. So in order to fix this, China will have to do a lot more that what has beend announced so far. I suppose they will. They might be less dogmatic about letting the market regulate itself, than the US was back in the day. But there is an element of risk involved in China investments. And everything related to that."

Anyways, tons of pedos on there, and they were always so obvious, but I was crafty. I had a fake name, fake phone number, fake address, and a whole fake identity I used on the internet from age 915, because my parents warned me about creeps.

Lunar Lakes only redeeming quality is that it uses the least amount of battery power but thats only because they have such worse processing power."

IBM is going through the same process but the jury is still out. If you want to bet on a resurrection knock yourself out but most legacy companies do not make successful transitions.

There is the issue of revenue recognition too, sometimes based on degree of progress in projects, I think I read on IonQ. A bit shady to me, but I might be completely wrong. Just wanted to mention because I noticed you dont say anything about this, and maybe I can learn something new today if someone more knowledgeable can comment."

Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations."

Helicopters are considered mature technology yet also still very dangerous. Energy density of oil is still vastly superior to any batteries available which puts some hard current limits on things like range versus capacity. That said, theres some key differences between those and evtol. From a risk management perspective, All its going to take is one highly public Kobe Bryant or a Troy Gentry and the whole things going to crater. Thats very hard to predict but its still immature and early enough is thats all it going to take to eat massive losses. Its cheap enough Ill go ahead and put down some funny money on it in long, but its money Ive accepted could instantly go down in flames if a Kobe happens"

I only believe in Joby and I strongly feel Archer is going to fold or go bust in 4 years or less. I will give reasons for this in short as I dont have patience n dont have time or care to convince anyone. 1. Joby truly developed eVTOL from scratch and have complete new new design. Archer is just electric helicopter where they are assembler of aircraft where why may have just swap the engine with electric motors. Due to this their aircraft is almost 1200lbs heavier than Joby. This in itself going to kill then in operating cost and cannot compete with Joby which will multi fold efficient n cheaper to operate thereby cheaper on pricing 2. Archer is mostly style n less substance. Their flight has yet to do extensive flight testing. They are flying empty . So currently its just baloon with no payload. Once you add payload most likely their design will go bust. The design is too heavy n bulky 3. Dilution Archer is going for extensive dilution every quarter against plant setup and labor supply from Stellantis . Moreover they plan issue more shares. 4. Archer certification in time is very difficult given they need to integrate number of desperate components n technology. Joby developed almost 8090 IP inhouse so they integrate seamlessly with common software language. 5. Archer is led by businessman vs Joby is led by technocrat 6. Joby has successfully tested hydrogen flight. In 56 year they will have it approved. Then they will have huge cost advantage and unparalleled technology edge 7. Autonomy only Joby has full autonomous rights to their own plane. Archer sold it to WiskBoeing. Robo AirTaxi. This is where real money is. Believe me Robo AirTaxi will happen before TeslaWaymo or Aurora. Once you do in depth study you will uncover few more obvious reasons why archer is way behind and over priced at current valuation. Overall Archer is not gonna pop its gonna poop soon."

Ive looked into Archer a few times now and while Im tempted to buy in, I have a couple of hurdles Im struggling to get over. First of all Im having a hard time seeing a scenario where they arent just acquired by another megacorp. Boeing going ballsdeep and consolidating them with Wisk makes a lot of sense both companies are functionally the same, it merely seems to be the case that Archer want to push a more VIP and militaryoriented aircraft lineup while Wisk is designed much more in the mould of an airtaxi Uber. Stellantis might also be interested in a direct acquisition if they can envision a more profitable return by cutting out other major investors like United and Boeing, as well as gaining them exposure to valuable US military contracts. Im also not fully convinced by the eVTOL airtaxi concept. As a means of rapid transportation it does have potential is there anyone who doesnt want to reach their destination not just in style but also half an hour earlier?? but I need to know exactly how theyre going to make it affordable for people that arent just highincome earners, because otherwise it will ultimately be an unprofitable service due to the complexity of the technology and the lack of a large clientele base. The stock has a lot of potential but the hurdles are really fucking big, I aint gonna lie."

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywells Advanced Air Mobility AAM Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation SFAR for poweredlift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the next month. I think youll see it is quite responsive to industry comments, Coes told attendees. It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers. The SFAR was a hot topic at last years summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like poweredlift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. ... However, at this years summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. Theres great anticipation for the rule, which were told is coming in just a few weeks, said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association NBAA. If the FAA can deliver the rule in just a few short weeks, itll be a major accomplishment for the agency. ... While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM for unmanned aerial systems UAS operating beyond visual line of sight BVLOS be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFARs timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations."

You make a big deal about creating their own IP but Archers counter point is that their parts are industry standard and can be purchased and produced more easily. Personally, I think both have a fair point. Archer also has their own IP in the most important parts which include the drive train. 2. I really like the look and feel of Archer way more than Joby. Joby looks like they took a drone from DJI and scaled it up to a person capable aircraft. Not necessarily a bad thing but as far as style goes Archer definitely has that edge. Also, they will soon have their pilot test certification soon. So thats no really a great argument against them. Their fortest certification is coming soon and will be a major announcement. 3. Nothing really to say here as this stuff aint cheap. Raising capital is something they both have to do. Its not like you can make the argument that Joby doesnt have to do this too. Both are have delivered aircraft to the military and both are set to deliver more. Again, both will be players in this arena and thats a good thing. Competition is a good thing. Dont forget a short report and subsequent short float on Joby is a thing too as their short is about 19. The reason why I chose Archer however is that their current market cap has much deeper value than Joby at these current levels. Currently Joby is valued at 3.74 Billion while Archer Aviation is valued at only 1.09 Billion with a much higher float. So, with all of that I have to think Archer at this moment is a better buy. Both of their market caps can easily be in the 50 100 Billion range in the 4 6 year future which will be a substantial gain for all those invested. In the short term, if Archer keeps pushing and gets their certs a 3x increase will be a 3 Billion market cap and that seems completely justified. That would also be a 300 increase in the stock price from 3 to 9 a share. I say this is an easy bagger if you ask me. Deep fucking value if there ever was one."

Dont forget, Archer first started off with the Maker which was a smaller aircraft. The hydrogen thing is not really important right now so lets get these guys flying first and then we can advance to more payload, larger eVTOLs in general and further distances. I think the pipeline for both of these companies will be great. They just need to get off the ground first. Literally. Again, one has a current market cap of 3.47 B and the other only 1 B.

Also how does an eVTOL pilot cost less? They still have to be trained to the standard that the FAA requires and since they are flying a vehicle that can fly like a helicopter or an airplane, they need to have training in both, something that is certainly not cheap. Being quieter might be nice but it offers not much of a benefit. Any aircraft that is within the noise limits will work, you dont get bonus points for being quieter. And using nontraditional fuels isnt really a flex when most airports dont have the chargers for them. Also being cool doesnt mean useful.

Currently they have approval to fly only for insight conditions so they need to first cross that barrier Agree that Waymo is ahead than Tesla. Honestly these are two diff markets. I see with autonomy more traffic will be on road increasing congestion so we will have to go to air. Biggest problem I see with eVTOL is it would be 3 rides to get to destination to heliport, air ride and then from heliport to final destination. eVTOLs have use cases diff than road travel flying from JFK to Long Branch NJ, between islands in Caribbeans, city centers to outskirts suburban mansions etc before they go full main stream. Not in 10 but in 20 years they will be mass produced like cars today and folks will have this in their backyard or walkable garages. Sounds unbelievable but thats the future I see."

However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions. Admiteddly, severed all ties is a bit excessive, severed most of them is more accurate."

Developing their own heat shield material Lockheed later on bought that heat shield material. Beck simply didnt have the money to start with a real rocket program right away.

I am not sure about the price though. SpaceX already spend 5 billion dollars on the starship development. And the first few years the starships are already sold Artemis mission, Musks Mars mission etc. Another important aspect if you deploy a constellation like Starlink you do not put every satellite into the same orbital plane. You need to insert the satellites into different orbital planes so launching 100 or even 150 tons of satellites into a single orbital plane does not make sense. You could of course solve that with orbital transfer vehicles, but that adds weight and cost. So lets see how that plays out long term. If Starships becomes dominating RocketLab positioned Neutron well to scale it up. Instead of Merlins gas generator engine they went with a ox rich staged combustion engine. One can expect performance gains over time look at how much Blue Origin gets out of a ox rich staged combustion engine of similar size. If satellites and payloads in general become significantly larger and heavier due to Starship RocketLab could use the same engines for the heavy lift rocket and maybe even use the Neutron 1st stage as a 2nd stage of the heavy lift rocket. Starship is 50 meters high and 9 meter wide. Neutron is 42 meters high and 7 meters wide. Plus the tank parts are potentially stretchable."

So doesnt matter if spacex is so cheap, if there rocket is full and has a backlog months out...your gonna cough up all the money you got to get on the second cheapest option neutron. It also wont surprise me you see a neutron heavy or something else and expand in scale 57 years down the road okay. And rocketlab works with a superior material. So if they make a rocket the same size as spacex, itll be a better rocket because one works with a 20th century material and the other works with a 21st century material."

But RocketLab scaled Electron faster to 50 launches that SpaceX scaled F9 to 50 launches even with reuse. If they can replicate that and also scale Neutron faster than SpaceX scaled F9 it could get even in that regard interesting. Not handing your competitor cash Amazon Kuiper vs. Starlink is a big incentive to go with the maybe slightly more expensive option. SpaceX is still clearly ahead. And by a margin. But that competition gets more interesting by the day. And the valuation difference is too high. SpaceX is valued at 200 billion in private. In public it would probably be 500 b. It doesnt make sense that RocketLab is only valued at 5 b. So far they are 2nd behind SpaceX. They are scaling their revenue impressively. From 60 m to 400m in like 4 years. With positive gross margins. They should be valued higher already in my opinion reason for me to buy in."

So yeah its true they are losing money faster than they are gaining it, this is not a problem with their business model or a sign of a dying business no one wants to buy stuff from, which I think is an important factor that people overlook.

My concern with RKLB is theyre fighting the last war, so to speak, and at best will be competing for third place in the launch market. We can debate the size of that market and how valuable third place is, but theres a ceiling."

Not only the economic development of the company, but also the changing sentiment due to politics, the general perception of the company and the industry etc. 10 years is a long time. And you asked for the ceiling, so I will list ambitious goals In 10 years I expect them to have developed Neutron into a major vehicle. As capable or more capable payload and pricekg than Falcon 9. Archimedes is also a good starting point for a starship like vehicle. Unlike Falcon 9s engine it is a high performing staged combustion engine. In 10 years they are maybe already almost done developing a starship sized vehicle. There will be a need for a lot of 1 way trips to Mars and maybe the carbon composites are cheaper than stainless steel if you do not reuse the vehicle. Starlink is a great example of whats possible in the satellite space. RocketLab isnt able to start with something like that. But they could get their overtime. They may even merge or cooperate or share revenue with ASTS. I think a reasonable ceiling I do not think that this is the most likely, but a certainly possible outcome is 500 billion."

And long term they made some smart decisions to potentially undercut F9. Minimal ground infrastructure. Better aerodynamic form like Starship, because not designed with road transport in mind. Ox rich staged combustion instead of gas generator also easier scale up to large vehicle like New Glenn Attached fairings saves cost in marine assets. Lets say how this plays out until 2030."

TQQQ, SQQQ, SPXL, SPXU, UVXY, and SVIX are my most traded stocks, and this year Ive been fortunate. The democratization of space may lead to more opportunities, but thats too much of a gamble for me to hold RKLB long term, personally. And to be frank, I dont know what you mean by the phrase. Do you mean everyone will have access to space, rich and poor? Because thats what the words would indicate, but I dont know if I see that happening within the next twenty years, given current technology. Id like to reiterate my previous point in a new way, given your thoughts on the imminent takeover of space by the plebes Even if everyone did have access to space, what would they do up there? What goods would they produce and sell, besides existing technology? What new business would come to RKLB, from what sector? Add to it this unfortunate fact Profitability still escapes them. 320 mil in revenue could be better, and it would be better if they sold a good that appealed to a broader market, but they do not.

Havent found much up to date examples but this data from 2019 shows that the cost per kg has dropped from about 10 000 to 1500. And we see due to that all these constellations starting to pop up. Since this makes it more affordable companies will pop up with new and novel ideas. And since Rocket lab can provide the engineering and servicing to design and build these payloads, that is a market that will grow. I agree there is danger of a bubble forming, especially since we have ridiculous ideas like a company that wants to put giant ass mirrors in space so you can order sunlight via an app And I obviously glanced over the fact that RKLB is not profitable yet, but if they would stop all neutron development they would be profitable. And hopefully with neutron flying they will swing to profitability. I admit all these space stocks are risky and an obvious gamble. Personally I believe in RKLB and also ASTS. They are still at a low market cap but high risk that a payoff might be worth it. Thanks for the discussion! I definitely enjoyed it!"

Distilling recession data down to jobs vs cpipi is absurd, especially when the real issue is money inmoney out and debt. It is wage inflation that combats price inflation. The metric I would be most concerned about is total personal debt which has skyrocketed and loan defaults home, auto, cc For reasons I will never understand, most people dont change their lifestyle when they experience financial stress, they go to their credit card. Food, fuel, rent, insurance, etc.. It all doubled. I would time the crisis a hot minute after enough people hit spending limits on credit cards, or lose credit for nonpayment that the news takes notices and starts talking about it.

So they flooded the economy with mass new wealth to defeat inflation...Corporations lend on longer rates anyways. Not only that but that consensus is conditions didnt tighten sufficiently, unemployment didnt spike up, so therefore Feds tool didnt work. They didnt do anything. to demand side inflation.

Until you start looking at it was from 20192023 and not in one year This should have been a red flag for any one reading. Then you have to look at the thing the article didnt talk about which is how much did inflation and cost of living rise during that sametime. Food prices 25 increase Housing 40 Rent 20 Inflation CPI increased by 1520 with energy up 3040 by 2023, So again while great it rose 13 it has not kept up with the cost of living. So the reality is everyone actually just got a pay cut. It is like when you get a raise of 3 but inflation went up 5, did you really get a raise then?

As it was, they were still burning that money printer basically ever since the financial crisis until COVID. Imo, that was wildly irresponsible and unnecessary. They could have eased off to better prep. Tbf, thats not all on Powell its also on Yellen. And, its probably not only on Trump, but also on Obama, even though it didnt come up near as often under Obama because the economy was cruising along just fine. Edit I appreciate your link, tho.

You might like some games better but Ghost of Tsushima for example has had the very same problems almost pretty much every open world game has Its mission design is repetitious. To me the solution is Make games shorter but more intense. 20 hours of gameplay is more than enough and quit implementing those fing sidequests I skip in every game but have to pay for. If I wanted to grind myself to death Id do more hours at work and would even get paid for that."
