And it feels like almost every other big game release lately has been plagued with issues that get sorted out eventually, but they probably would have been better off delaying and launching a more polished product in the first place.

Its obnoxious. It has no emotion. It doesnt understand how to pause for drama, how to use inflection properly to emphasize things. The same is true for visual art. If you ask AI to draw you 100 character sprites, youre going to get like 70 different art styles that dont look cohesive together. Sure....you can try to reign it in with parameters. You can give it a color palette. You can train it on a data set that is all of a similar style that it will try to replicate. But youve removed the human element and made everything cold and samey. REAL artists know when they can break the rules like using something outside of the standard palette for artistic effect. When you remove the artist, you remove all the complexity that makes people feel something when they look at it. The same is true for code. You can go to school and learn best practices all you want. But there are times in code when it absolutely makes sense to do things that are antipattern. Things that go against the grain of common sense. But an AI trained on nothing but textbooks that say DO NOT EVER DO THIS is never going to reach that unique solution. People who are not software engineers are not qualified to tell me a degree holding engineer when or if AI is going to take my job.
