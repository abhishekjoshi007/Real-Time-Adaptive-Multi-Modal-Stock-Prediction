Seasonal content makes sense for some games, but theyve been getting shoehorned into everything lately as a revenue source, to the detriment of the games. And it feels like almost every other big game release lately has been plagued with issues that get sorted out eventually, but they probably would have been better off delaying and launching a more polished product in the first place. For these reasons alone, I hope AC Shadows is good and does well. Hopefully the gaming industry will take note and will start moving back towards quality over cashgrabs."

If theres only 100 variable values that control the physics system, hiring 300 devs and 500 testers to get it right isnt going to do you much good.

Your customers hate it anyway assuming you avoided bankruptcy from no revenue for years Or do you cut some things out so you can at least get something out earlier, with a hit to reputation but at least you survive? Your customers might dislike it but less than the first option Obviously, best case scenario is always deliver projects on time, to quality and under budget. But youre very, very laughably naive if you think that happens all the time Time cost quality sacrifices are made all the time it doesnt mean companies hate their customers. It means they overpromised and underdelivered"

Its obnoxious. It has no emotion. It doesnt understand how to pause for drama, how to use inflection properly to emphasize things. The same is true for visual art. If you ask AI to draw you 100 character sprites, youre going to get like 70 different art styles that dont look cohesive together. Sure....you can try to reign it in with parameters. You can give it a color palette. You can train it on a data set that is all of a similar style that it will try to replicate. But youve removed the human element and made everything cold and samey. REAL artists know when they can break the rules like using something outside of the standard palette for artistic effect. When you remove the artist, you remove all the complexity that makes people feel something when they look at it. The same is true for code. You can go to school and learn best practices all you want. But there are times in code when it absolutely makes sense to do things that are antipattern. Things that go against the grain of common sense. But an AI trained on nothing but textbooks that say DO NOT EVER DO THIS is never going to reach that unique solution. People who are not software engineers are not qualified to tell me a degree holding engineer when or if AI is going to take my job. You have absolutely NO concept of what it cancant do in terms of code, you dont have the skills to analyze it appropriately. You can tell it to write you a bunch of code, and it will spit out a bunch of complex looking stuff. And you, as a noncoder, will look at it and be like wow thats wild. But you dont know if it gave you anything useful because you arent qualified in this field to judge it. Just like I can give ChatGPT a list of medical symptoms and it will spit out a bunch of medical jargon that looks really smart. But I am not a doctor. I am absolutely not qualified to determine whether or not ChatGPT made up a bunch of shit that isnt true. I dont have the skills or knowledge to make that determination. The type of people who think AI is going to take over have a very tenuous grasp of how it even works. It shouldnt even be called intelligence because it isnt doing ANYTHING smart. It works EXACTLY the same way as the predictive text on your phone keyboard. It takes its best guess as to what the next word in the sentence is. Nothing more. Nothing less. It isnt capable of reasoning and we arent anywhere near making a breakthrough to change that. AI also isnt capable of understanding the nuances that make people feel emotional over artistic content. And it never will. At best it is a tool to let existing engineers speed up certain parts of their workflow. Im not losing my job to AI. Not in one decade, or two. Probably not in my lifetime."
