Its like buying a company built on a Native American burial ground. Your calls will be cursed. According to Wikipedia Zarnuqa was depopulated on 2728 May by the Givati Brigade during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War. One account in Al HaMishmar described how a soldier fired with a Sten gun at three people one old man, old woman and a child and how the villagers were taken out from the houses and had to stay in the sun, in hunger and thirst, until they surrendered the weapons they claimed they did not have. They were then expelled towards Yibna. In total, six died and 22 were taken prisoners. The day after, the inhabitants returned and recounted that the Yibna villagers saw them as traitors. The Zarnuqa villagers saw their village being ransacked by Jewish soldiers and nearby settlers. They were expelled again and the houses were demolished the month after.32 The family of the Shaqaqi brothers, Fathi one of the founders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the political scientist Khalil Ibrahim, was from Zarnuqa.33 They fled in the face of rumours of massacres of Palestinians by Yishuv troops and expected to return after the hostilities ended. They were not permitted to come back.5 Haidar Eid, Associate Professor at alAqsa University in Gaza, states that his parent were evicted from the village by members of the Haganah and Stern gang who told them Leave your homes or we will kill and rape you.34"
