From my perspective, its conservative mgmt that has always beat and raised and outpaced analyst expectations theyve also called out in regards to 26 guidance that it didnt incorporate any new products which theyve had new launches since this guidance was released and will inevitably have more. I also personally disagree that a high growth fintech should be valued as a legacy bank most of which have sub 10 rev growth. If their tech platform really accelerates and gets deals with large financial institutions itll be hard to ignore its part of the valuation delta vs banks. Theyve also leaned into originating for other companies no capital loan origination and loan servicing revenue where they dont take on risk. Its possible that growth completely stagnates in 27 but I dont think itll be that mature of company by then. Right now massive tailwinds for company with interest rate cuts, regulatory changes driving demand for tech platform, significant demand for loans for higher income individuals which is Sofia bread and butter.

Reddit,2024-10-29,"If Crox didnt buy HD the stock would probably be 300 right now from buying back 13 of their shares instead and having no debt. But it is what it is, cant change the past. Outside of the poor decision to pay so much for HD, the business is still strong and they are positioning Hey Dude for positive impact long term. They are focusing on DTC for Hey Dude similar to Crox which is a strategy that has increased gross margins and brand loyaltyengagement and to me is a better measure of consumer demand. The of revenue thats DTC for Hey Dude has gone from about 30 to nearly 44 TTM. DTC revenue is only down about 9 while the big majority of HDs revenue drops are from wholesalers. With Hey Dudes branding it makes way more sense for them to focus on digital marketingsales and DTC. Their strategy is not off it will just take time after they pretty much completely reset the Hey Dude strategy a year ago. My biggest gripe with CROX right now is the ballooning SGA expenses. I hope that gets sorted out because they had it down to about 27 of revenue but now its gone back up to 34 of revenue. That needs to slow down, which I think it will. The combination of Hey Dude stabilizing, SGA growth slowing, and a reduced interest expense could give CROX a huge profit boost even without much revenue growth from the crocs brand. Those things are really masking the big gross margin gains over this same period. The bears are constantly waiting for Crocs brand to fall and prove its a fad and the Bulls are waiting for Hey Dude to stop contracting so much and start recovering but the results just kind of keep happening somewhere in the middle. Enough in either direction that you can convince yourself of whatever you want. I increased my CROX share count by a measly 3 today, will probably buy more if it drops another 4 or 5. My long term thesis in the business model of Crox hasnt really changed since I first bought shares in 2020.",Positive,1,0.9170185923576355,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-28,"I would strongly advise against this. Equity in a private company is not what it seems. The reality is usually that while they may say that you own, say, 50k in equity value, you simply do not have anyone to sell it to. The partners are probably low on cash, hence them offering you equity instead of money. That means that even if you wanted to monetize that equity, there is no way to do it. How much is worth shares of a company that is not making money and is illiquid? Pretty much zero. I would not necessarily advise against having a part like 10 to 20 of your compensation being in the form of equity. Thats a gamble that many people who work for startups make if the company succeeds, you might be looking at early retirement. But in the meantime you have bills to pay and a life to live. Being paid solely in equity is a recipe for exploitation. Before you know it youll be asking for them to pay you some of that equity for pennies on the dollar just so you can feed yourself and will feel like you have to keep working for them without limits, lest their company fails altogether and you end up never seeing the color of this promised value. A startup is all but guaranteed to go through multiple financial restructuring and you can expect early equity to be diluted or wiped out one way or another. So even if the company is ultimately successful, theres pretty high chance that the equity will still be virtually worthless. Its a terrible position to put yourself in and tbh, any serious startup with management worth their salt would not expect the people who work for them to do it without getting paid actual money.",Neutral,0,0.9997634291648865,Reply

Everyone already pointed out why you shouldnt do that. I would turn the tables on them and ask them for cash compensation and award you the stock as options. That essentially puts the power in your hand by giving you the money and then letting you decide whether you want to purchase those options. As a contractor you might not be privy to as much information as an employee, but this way at least you can opt to keep the cash. Otherwise, yeah, if theyre paying you only in preferred stock, I would treat this opportunity as unpaid. If youre at a point in your life where that makes sense, go for it!

After a while I told him that I dont think I have time to do this unless he paid me. We agreed to void our agreement and part ways. 6 months later he actually paid someone to build the website and when I asked how much he ended up spending, he was like, A lot.

That said to get the answers to these questions you will need to see a data room that has their financials. How else can you confirm if the valuation of the stocks they are giving you is fair? Also almost all of these stocks will be dilutable. Basically getting these requirements are going to rule out 98 percent of the I will pay you in stocks situations.

Reddit,2024-10-28,"I dont have a lot of contracting experience, but from what I know and have been told by others...For any contracting role, youd probably want to do some research to see how much theyre paying for similar roles for fulltime employees in the area, back into an hourly rate, and apply 50 on top or more as a starting point for negotiations. Going off YOE, youre probably in a senior role. In the US, the tech industry is still in a weird spot, but you can expect 150,000 to 250,000 a year depending on the company. Lets go with 204,000 as a halfway point to make it divisible to 17,000 a month. 20 work days a month, 8 hour days, translates that to 106.25. With that in mind, if I was contracting Id ask for at least 150 an hour. However, in the US not being an employee costs you A LOT in benefits, particularly health insurance. So theres a much larger premium for contractors since they have to cover all that stuff outofpocket. Some of my contracting buddies prefer to do daily rates rather than hourly. It lets them smooth out their earnings as the project ramps up and winds down. I definitely see the value in that I was once contracting by the hour and it was great in the beginning because I was pulling in 60 hour weeks and getting 1.5x on anything over 40. Then as the project was finishing up and I was doing maybe 30 hours a week, I was making a lot less.

But if you read the actual case, and FTCs mandate, then its quite clear why they were right to pursue it and why every qualified panel and judge who has looked it at in careful detail agreed wholeheartedly. Its not just about having choice and capitalist consumerism for handbags or jackets. And its not just about protecting the interests of the employees, tenants, suppliers, and coretailers. Its about blocking the deliberate and patent creation of a exploitive monopoly, something thag is in FTCs mandate to prevent. And by doing so, with unanimous confirmation by every qualified expert, it sends a proactive message to other corrupt opportunist in any sector or business who might have wanted to try their luck at flouting our antimonopoly laws. Some who understand this deeper reasoning may still complain that truly big monopolies or oligopolies are not being held to account as strictly.

I think theres a decent chance of moderate outperformance of VOO, and a decent chance of underperforming, and very little chance of vastly outperforming. If I were going to buy MSFT, it would be one of my safety plays, not a bet on particularly good returns. I think psychologically its a bad idea to choose only one stock also. Is it worth the negatives which also include missing out on alternative investments, and being so attached to the fortunes of a single company. If its 2 or even 5 and its not moved after a year or two or even down a little, well you can live with that, but with 30 that wouldnt be nice to underperform even VOO with that percentage over that time.

From the ER from earnings. Backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 5.68 billion as compared to 5.77 billion as of June 30, 2024 and 4.29 billion as of September 30, 2023.

Mr. Lane continued, Backlog continues far above the levels of the prior year and bookings were remarkable even as we are burning through work at a record pace, with samestore revenue higher by 18 on a quarterly basis, and by 23 yeartodate, compared to the prior year. Entering the fourth quarter, samestore backlog is 21 higher than it was at this time last year, and we are experiencing unprecedented strength in our pipelines.

Reddit,2024-10-25,I honestly think Nvidia is undervalued since its hard for us to fathom what kind of market theyve created. They are revolutionizing computing and everyone will rely on GPUs moving forward. They basically have infinite scale and Ive heard Tom Lee say theyre on track to eventually do 1T in annual sales. Could they become a 10T company? 20T? 30T? Who the heck knows. Amazon has been a slow mover since the pandemic and sells off everytime its about to make a run. I think Jassy will finally pivot to profitability but the days of 50 growth are behind us. Also Trump winning will cause this stock to randomly sell off over the next 4 years as he berates Bezos in public and works behind the scenes to screw Amazon over. He interfered on the Pentagon cloud procurement process which cost AWS a 10b contract. Hell also come at their retail business and keep the antitrust suit going. Google is definitely undervalued but antitrust and perceptions of complacency and other AI companies taking share from them will keep it weighed down. Investors like Meta because of the perception Zuck is hungry to innovate and win.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Teslas net income is down 32 yy through the first three quarters of the year. Not good. Their original guidance was 50 CAGR from 2020 2030. They were above 50 through 2023. Through 2024, their CAGR looks like itll be dropping to around 38. If they maintain a similar unit sales volume in 2025, itll drop to 30. Not good. Tesla has a forward PE of over 72 right now, which will be even higher tomorrow. Other OEMs, who have performed far better than Tesla recently, are sitting around forward PEs of 57. Teslas valuation heavily relies on the idea of constant future growth. Their robotaxi event was generally scoffed at. Not good. It was fairly expected theyd beat estimates, and given how shit the stock has been lately, that often leads to a short term pump. I could see a 61.8 retracement by the end of the month from wherever its high is over the next 12 days probably right around 240, dropping to 222. Then I imagine itll pop back up to a lower high around 250255. Then, its likely all down from there, likely back down to around the 160175 area by beginning of next year... lining up with quarterly sales figures which I dont expect to be spectacular. Maybe it beats last year, but that isnt saying much when they were previously claiming a 50 CAGR. Why this stock is worth so much more than other auto OEMs is probably a question a lot of major investors are asking themselves. A lot of them were betting on autonomous taxis... but Musk can only claim its 12 years away for so long before they eventually start to wise up. 10 years... hes been claiming that every year for 10 years straight now The stocks a dog, Meme investors just dont know it yet. Its been in a long term downward trend, no doubt supported by a core of buy and hold forever insiders and cultists, and of course SP index funds that will only sell if everyone else does.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Regulatory credits are 100 income 100 corporate profit. Comparing the first 3 quarters of the year, their regulatory income is approximately 700 million higher than the previous highest year. Theyve pulled in about 1.7 1.8 billion in regulatory income in each of the last two years. Theyre on course to pull in 2.5 billion in regulatory income in 2024. Its a pretty massive chunk of their total net income for having to do absolutely nothing to get it save sell the cars they were going to sell anyways. Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus 7.069 billion last year, or 32 lower yy. Remove the 700 million extra in regulatory credits yy, and it would have been closer to 4.1 billion or a 42 drop in income yy on their actual product sales. Theyre on course to just about match their total unit vehicle sales yy theyre still a bit behind last year through Q3. The problem is that their long term guidance which helped lead to the run up overvaluation in the stock price is 50 CAGR between 2020 and 2030. They rescinded that guidance in Q3 23 because they dont believe its possible anymore. To stay even with the 50 CAGR in 2024, theyd have need to sell over 2.5 million vehicles, but theyre on course to sell about 1.8 million. 2025 could see little if any sales growth versus 20232024. However, to maintain the 50 CAGR in 2025, theyd have to hit 3.8 million vehicle sales. Starting to see the problem? Their forward PE is based on crazy growth guidance, which even Tesla has admitted they cant hit, yet the stock is still trading at a forward PE of over 80. Most of the major OEMs across the world trade a forward PE of between 5 and 7. Teslas sales arent growing, their revenue isnt growing, and their income isnt growing, which means their PE is based on nothing more than a hope and a dream.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Regulatory credits are the carbon credits they sell. Its not the federal state EV tax credit. They dont count EV tax credits anywhere since they dont receive them directly. Although... Im not sure how that applies to leases, tbh. Their regulatory credit sales, counted as 100 profit margin, are 700 million higher than last year through the first 3 quarters. In Q3, regulatory credit sales accounted for 34 of their total net income. Tesla once again lives on subsidies, whether theyre paid by the government, or other OEMs are forced to pay them to Tesla through regulations... which essentially points out just how excessively Teslas vehicles are subsidized. 7500 federal tax credit 1500 5000 state tax credit Hard to say how much theyre getting from EV regulatory credit sales per Tesla sold, but my guess would be around 2000 per vehicle.

There will always be hobbyist and specialty use ICE vehicles, so itll never be 100 but it should be close. If you dont believe EVs are the primary future of passenger vehicles, you probably shouldnt be in Tesla in the first place, but there are hydrogen believers. Still. FWIW, I think its a strong probabilty that they will be. China is the only real concern, I dont see any serious challenge to Tesla dominance coming from anywhere else. On the other hand, China is doing well, and a governmentbacked Chinese company has ... not quite unlimited funding for expansion, but ... a lot. There is a real risk though that Tesla is regulated into failure in the US and Europe as political revenge for Elons activities, Teslas antiunion position, or both. If not actually shutting Tesla down with red tape, then subsidizing some competition that otherwise wouldnt be a viable threat. There has also always been a real risk that Elon says something intemperate that wrecks the China relationship China has a history anyway of letting foreign companies in to learn their technology before regulating them out or subsidizing the locals enough to push out the foreigners. It didnt happen that way to Apple and may not happen that way to Tesla if they also export enough Chinesemade product to be a net benefit for the Chinese... theres reason to be hopeful. Provided that Elon doesnt retweet any Winnie the Pooh memes, of course. Anyway, Im not selling my TSLA position, and odds are IMO reasonable, but it would be a mistake to think that dominating the emerging market in any way guarantees dominating the mature market.",Neutral,0,0.8355739712715149,Reply

We really dont know what long term environmental impact the mining sites for the battery materials are having though, or what frontloading a high load of emissions is having, such as the difference in manufacturing a BEV w a large battery, versus manufacturing an ICEV Hybrid PHEV. Sure, traditional OEMs dont have to report the billions in from environmental damage, however, Teslas vehicles dont all run on 100 renewable energy, so they too benefit from not paying for environmental damage caused by the electricity production their cars use to move. Im all about carbon taxes and taxes on practices that damage the environment to level the playing field, and preferably to move more people way from owning driving personal vehicles so much. Its the only fair way to go about it IMO. Key is that a carbon tax would actually give a huge benefit to people who ride public transit, ride bikes and PEVs, work from home, or in those workers at businesses that implement 4 day work weeks. Something the EV subsidy programs arent doing. Plus, carbon environmental taxes impact all facets of life, not just transportation. From the amount of electricity we use at home, the amount of hot water we use, the foods we eat, the things we buy, etc... The government is spending a LOT of money on a solution thats doing far too little. The regulatory credit policies are, IMO, not having the impact they were intended to have.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Just to repeat from my last comment, and add a bit more info, regulatory credit isnt simple revenue... its 100 net income... 100 profits. 739 million is 33.6 of Q3s net income. Keep in mind, a massive chunk of their remaining net income comes from government subsidies. In the US for example, theyre still seeing 7500 federal tax credits on a large percentage of their total sales which allows them to maintain higher MSRPs, translating into higher profit margins. Most of their sales are in states with state EV tax credits as well, often in the 15002500 range. Some as high as 5000. Their energy sales are even more subsidized than their car sales. The federal government subsidizes something like 30 of the overall cost of a solar panel home battery storage installation. States with the highest rooftop solar adoption rates often have additional incentives on top. Overall, it can reach up to 50. Im not sure on their grid scale power storage, but Im guessing the subsidies andor the amount theyre charging the government, which often has mandates written into law to have storage installed, are lucrative. Like 2023... if Tesla were to exclude regulatory credit income and government subsidies from their income, theyd likely be reporting a loss for 2024. I guess this doesnt technically matter unless there were a risk that the subsidies were going to disappear in short order.. which theres no sign of. Some headwinds for Q4 Theyve removed their lowest priced trim model 3 near the end of Q3, which had the imported Chinese LFP battery. That could hit their overall sales numbers in Q4. It also means theyre not going to sell cars with the significantly cheaper LFP packs, which likely generated some decent profit margins. These units didnt qualify for the full tax credit on sales although I do believe they still qualified on leases, which Tesla would have had to roll into the lease price. Not sure if they did or didnt do that. They significantly cut the price of the Cybertruck and still dont seem to have a backlog after the price cut per their estimated delivery dates on their site. Theyve significantly cut the prices on their inventory vehicles. Model 3s Ive seen have up to 3k discounts applied. Model Y has as much as 4k discounts applied. Model Y accounts for the majority of their sales. That said, they were also aggressively discounting inventory vehicles last year in Q4. Theyre offering 0 financing offers which I believe is new this year. While this wont impact their unit sales, it will mean additional losses of up to 5k per vehicle over the course of the loan that they otherwise would have made on interest. I do expect Tesla to break their sales numbers from last year, if only because theyre so deeply discounting their vehicles. However, I expect their revenue and net income to be down in Q4 yy as a result of their deep discounting.",Neutral,-1,0.8489641845226288,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-23,"I used to work for a guy at a global logistics company. We were tasked with building something that had never been built before, using Machine LearningTM. The idea is simple.

Now we were a motley crew to say the least most of my coworkers were Serbian and frankly not very intelligent. Nevertheless, I dont foresee the brightest minds solving the problem. I equate the problem of having a computer do human tasks like driving a car to putting a man on the moon, curing HIV, or harnessing nuclear fusion. The THEORY is straightforward. The implementation often requires the literal invention of new elements and materials in the case of NASAs Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. So we know at a high level how to build FSD. I guarantee the guys at Tesla working on it have the theory nailed down. The implementation is what they are struggling with. Like driving, perfection is required to get people to and from space safely, cure HIV, or harness nuclear fusion. This is not shit that can be wrong half the time or even 20 of the time like ChatGPT.

When the investment community stops believing and the markets stop considering Tesla an AI stock. I dont know exactly when or how that could happen, but at some point, people could lose faith and Teslas 800 Billion market cap would deflate. I can see some scenarios A competitor like Waymo achieves FSD first and takes over the space entirely. Tesla itself writes off Billions of dollars of AI training hardware if it becomes apparent that current Neural Net software methodologies are insufficient and the datacenters they set up are useless. Ive seen similar writedowns in the biotech space a company finds that their path on a project is on a dead end and they sell off all the equipment for that project. Governments deem Teslas AI projects to be dangerous and either regulate them out of existence or seize them outright. I believe that for the next few years, TSLA will continue to inflict psychological and possibly financial harm on everyone TSLA bulls with blind faith in Musk will insist that the company is much more valuable than its market cap, and be continually upset by erratic earnings and uncertain progress with no guarantee of success. TSLA bears who hate the company will keep harping on its market cap as overinflated and be continually upset by the multihundreds of Billions valuation.

While the IBM case is more complex they survived the PC era thanks to their mainframe business and supplying PowerPC for Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony game consoles, and lately Quantum Computing has made them to be relevant again, whoever invested in them and kept it during this time, in the end they have been rewarded. And looking at the graph now, from an ATH of 200 they went down to 100 in 2020 and they are now at 230. Not too bad. And considering they are one of the most important actors in quantum computing, they will probably continue growing at a good pace. Blackberry is a completely different story. It is true that before the turndown, no one saw it coming. Essentially, no one saw the iPhone coming. Once the iPhone was out, it was clear from the first day that it was a gamechanger. Every possible actor had to react very quickly or die sooner or later. The most evident victims were Nokia and BB. Google was able to react quickly by removing the keyboard from Android. The first versions did not support virtual keyboards I guess everyone remembers Steve Ballmer laughing at a phone that cost 500 and didnt even have a keyboard. It took them a few years to move to Android, and by then, it was way too late. I didnt have any shares on BB back then, but I would have dumped them shortly after seeing that the only BB business model was no longer relevant and that they were not reacting to the changes. With Tesla, although it is clear they will not keep growing the way they did before, it seems unlikely that today they will follow the path BB took.

I specifically noted the high front loading of high emissions. Why did I mention this? The planet can only sequester so much carbon over a given period. What happens if we significantly increase the amount of carbon we produce in a given year on account of a manufacturing process that spikes the levels of emissions? What are the impacts to the environment? Does it result in more ocean acidification, because the CO2 is sucked up by the oceans instead of the forests? Thus leading to devastation of coral reefs and oceanic plant life, and styming the Oceans ability to sequester more carbon? Again, not something covered in cradle to grave assessments.. Sure, power grids are changing... slowly... and will continue to do so over time. That doesnt mean there arent significantly better solutions to the environmental problem than simply MOAR CARS!. Were to the point where every bit of CO2 we inject into the atmosphere will likely require more energy and time to suck back out of the atmosphere in the future with CO2 sequestration processes.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"CT is the third best selling EV... which isnt saying much. Its still seeing low quarterly unit sales. Teslas also recently lowered prices or at least no longer requires an expensive package which consists of software and whats essentially a few cheap pieces of plasticmetal, and its pretty clear from their order page that theres no backlog remaining for this vehicle. At least, not at these prices. We also know that CT sales seem to be cannibalizing model SX sales... or maybe SX customers are just going the way of the dodo, and new buyers came in to buy the CT. Maybe a mix of both. Either way, theyre trading two high cost potentially high margin vehicles for one. Cars still make up the lions share of their revenue. Both divisions rely on large orders of cells. One cant exist without the other. If car sales slow down, Tesla offloads excess cells through their energy division. It just so happens that their energy products are subsidized to a much larger percentage than their vehicles. How large the overall market is for their energy products is anyones guess. Frankly, Liion isnt exactly the most cost effective way for storing energy in a static location. Solar roof seems to generally be a failure of a product. Ironically, their powerwall sales would likely be far lower if they actually allowed V2L capabilities in their nonCT vehicles. Its a a conflict of interest for them to enable V2L capabilities in their vehicles, which is kind of silly when you think about it. Theyre screwing the customer intentionally to pad their own pocketbooks. I imagine Other revenue may have been FSD. Remember that near the end of the quarter, Tesla started offering 0 financing, but only if you bought FSD. It essentially made FSD cost like 1k or something after all was said and done. Early in Q4 now... Teslas removed that requirement and is now just offering 0 financing on their model 3 and Y with no need to buy FSD. Theyre also discounting their model 3 Y inventory by 2k 4k. Not listening to the earnings call so dont know what hes saying about their forecast, but I doubt it... Without a new lower priced model, or deeply discounting their existing models, their market isnt large enough. We dont know where the economy will be next year, but it could certainly worsen. It seems calls for a recession arent as large as they have been, but I can certainly see some economic troubles. Growing credit card debt, credit card defaults, and auto loan defaults dont just magically go away. The real question is where will this magic increase in volume come from? 30 volume growth is an additional 540,000 vehicles produced and sold. They have no new factories under construction AFAIK. I cant see CT sales volumes growing much without significant price cuts, and I definitely dont think theyll be selling over 100k of them next year. Much like the F150L, I think there was the initial pent up demand, but once its out, its going to be a long slog to growth in that sector. Also, where are they planning to grow their sales? The US? Europe? China? Im guessing China, where they very well may be expanding havent heard much news on that front lately. However, if theyre expanding, theyre expanding at a time when all of the Chinese OEMs are also rapidly expanding. Somehow I dont think Teslas market will grow by 440k units in China in one year. Although... I mean China just enabled their government to buy Tesla vehicles... the first foreign brand theyve ever enabled that for. China also seems to be abnormally beholden to Tesla for some reason.",Neutral,0,0.8253759741783142,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-23,"I get it, Tortoise vs Hare. The reason you want to park money into staples is precisely that they have a high likelihood of being around in 40, 60, 80 and 100 years and they are very likely to keep growing the entire time. This is why staples are powerful. For instance, pull up a sector market share chart. If you do that you will notice something interesting. Techs market share has actually gone no where since the late 60s. It peaked in the .com bubble and is again in a slight bubble now, but overall, not changed since then. What has changed is the companies within. Lots of boom and busts and big time consolidation and concentration of value. Staples havent really changed much either in terms of market share but like I try to describe above, its very easy to pick winners from staples precisely because they are not boom and bust. At worst, they get bought out but they will never go obsolete. This low risk characteristic is extremely valuable because even a dummy can pick winner 90 of the time. You cant say that about picking tech or finance or even energy stocks. Are the big tech giants of the 60s still around? Some yes, but mostly no. Are all those popular fracking companies from the 2000s still around? Most went under in the financial crash. And banks are like revolving bankruptcies even if they dont go under entirely.... Folks need to start respecting risk and practice risk mitigation. There is a total disregard for that on this channel in favor of getting rich quick on the next double or 10 bagger.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"MSTR has increased the bitcoin it owns this year by about 33 and has increased its current share count roughly 15 through convertible debt offers resulting in a current increase of BTC per share of about 18 YTD. If it continues at this rate in 4 years the amount of Bitcoin it holds per share doubles. In 10 years BTC per share is 6x higher. If this happens owning MicroStrategy will give a shareholder more bitcoin than if they just bought a ETF. This is the chance holders are taking. So they are basically taking on low interest debt and buying bitcoin giving them leverage to the price of bitcoin in both directions. Many institutions that are limited to only investing in bonds want to lend money to MicroStrategy because it offers much better returns than government bonds or any other bonds. The other thing to remember is they have a software business that is working on developing bitcoin applications and have a goal of becoming a bank as well. So the premium to net asset value also reflects the chance that any of these ventures will be profitable, much like how many magnificent 7 companies are worth 3050x times current earnings in a year. If inflation continues to accelerate and BTC continues its trend over the past 15 years MSTR will possibly be the largest company in the world in 1020 years. If bitcoin stagnates for longer than a 4 year period they could go bankrupt. If BTC starts doing 10 a year average and doesnt have any explosive years like in the past MSTR might do ok but a Bitcoin ETF would likely out preform it.

The logic goes, if someone is willing to buy stock at a market cap of 80bn today, when its BTC holdings are worth say 30bn I dont know the exact figure, but that will do as an illustration, then if BTC continues to rise and MSTR keeps buying more of it with its newly issued shares, why wouldnt it trade at a market cap of 120bn when its BTC holdings hit 40bn?

Reddit,2024-10-22,"My guess, as someone who loads up in whenever its in the 2s is as follows... Im invested on the premise that at the core, peloton is a robust subscription business with a surprising amount of customers willing to pay a surprising subscription fee. For some people, a month of classes with a sub fee thats the same as one single in person class, that is great deal for them. And peloton apparently allows 2 users on a sub I think, so it works well for couples. It doesnt matter if 98 of the population hates them, they can make bank selling 40 subs to the people that dont. I would never pay it, but there are millions of people who like to have a trainer, a coach, an instructor yelling at them. Peloton fills that niche. Anyway, for those of us invested our thesis is peloton should get out of building and shipping and selling hardware and focus on the subscription since thats working well. We like when we hear things about them lowering their inventory of bikes. So my knee jerk read of this announcement is mixed.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"I sold it all on the top tick of the day, but a large part of that is my own discipline of selling large moves that are more qualitative than quantitative. Sometimes often? when a stock has giant move like that, all of the buyers of the last several years are solid green and they tend to take profit. Long term bag holders sometimes take the opportunity to dump their holding too. I am looking to generate gains in this tax year, so I have been looking to sell it if an opportunity arose, and I didnt want to gamble with it falling back and have to sell at a lower price in December. I know full well that it could continue to surge today or next week, but I can live with that. So for me its not about whether PTON is worth this price, but that this was my long term target when I was buying it under 3. Since then, theyve apparently gotten more sensible about their overall business plan, established a partnership with COSTCO, affirmed the stable subscription business, lined up the next CEO, and gotten an endorsement from a hedge fund legend who has a hot hand David Einhorn The CEO choice is tantalizing because Apple has been rumoured as a potential buyer of Peloton. Apple buys companies this size all the time. Apple is to increase their seeking subscription business. Apple is trying to make Health and fitness their thing. So naming an Apple Fitness guy as CEO just supercharges hopes that Apple could buy it. If PTON drops in the near future, Ill scoop it up again. Its a lot less risky than it was, and is looking more viable as a takeover target too. If it shoots up from here Id have to do some hard figuring to decide what price is attractive.",Neutral,0,0.9665511846542358,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Not sure if thats what they said, but one thing Ive called out here also just my opinion, is that lower rates will actually hurt the builders, since lower rates could unlock more used inventory. Historically used homes make up a vast majority of the housing market and because of the high rates and low inventory, new homes actually have been selling at higher rates. Also, new home builders can offer things like mortgage buy downs to draw people in. We are still going to need to build a ton of housing, just as rates go lower in the future and more used inventory becomes available, people will probably buy less new homes. Not saying home builders are a bad investment, just my fear is that theyve hit their peak in terms how much units they historically move. This spring, new home sales are a more important part of the market than they would be in a more typical year, says Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist for Bright MLS. In April, new singlefamily home sales were about 14 of total home sales nationwide. Typically, sales of new singlefamily homes account for less than 10 of all sales transactions, and the last time the new home share was this high was back in 2005.",Negative,-1,0.9994646906852722,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-18,"On the longterm value of the IP... They do and they dont. I think they have some exceptionally recognisable motifs. Space Marines are phenomenally recognisable and have hit the level of cultural saturation comparable to things like Lord of the Rings. What I mean by that is that without even realizing it, so much fantasy references LotR, and in the same way look at any design of a space super soldier and its probably going to incorporate some of the visual aesthetics and concepts of a Space Marine. But on the other hand, to be frank, the lore is a MESS from a storytelling perspective. I dont blame the writers for this, to be clear. Abnet and co. were writing under very unusual conditions of having to pump out pulp fiction at a phenomenal rate alongside I think five different edition changes, each adding to the future lore. The Horus Heresy series, which I take to be the biggest contribution to the lore, has the feel of a bridge being built as the train is riding along. This isnt their fault, actually it can be quite charming, as it was a product of their writing conditions. But the Heresy as is is not accessible. Its simultaneously too rushed and too bloated. Its major moments are thematically and narratively confused. It needs a HUGE rewrite if it was ever to be told as a Game of Thrones style epic story with that level of public traction. As an example, the thematically key moment in the final book is when the Emperor decides to reject ascension to being the Dark King and stay humanish. The prophecy of the Dark King isnt even mentioned until The End and the Death II the penultimate book, he is talked down from it by a character Ollanius Persson whos introduced as barely a B plot in book 19 and not mentioned again until book 58. Its honestly a little bit of No one has had a better story than Bran the Broken vibes! Now imagine frontloading the Dark King prophecy to Book 1 where Loken encounters Sammus. We are encouraged to first of all think the prophecy is about Sammus a demon antagonist of a few books, then Horus, then were unsure if its Horus or The Emperor. It could have been a really interesting mystery and throughline to the whole series. But if you did edit all of this, fans will be pissed. They hate lore retcons. So its the classic dilemma that these kinds of IPs face when adapting for a general audience You can edit your story to be more generally accessible, but this probably changes some elements in some ways that will upset a part of your fan base.",Neutral,0,0.9983421862125397,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-18,"Its going to be a highly speculative investment basically. As a company they dont make any more and they lost around 400M the last 12 months. I dont really follow the company, but they did go public a few years ago. Usually when that happens, a lot of the insiders could just have gotten a lot of equity in the company. They havent sold a ton, which is a good sign. These type of investments are really tough, since the company could succeed or it could possibly go bankrupt. If you like them, go for it. I think if you are young, there is nothing wrong with taking risk, especially if you believe in the company. Just dont invest anything you are willing to risk. This company could go bankrupt, could just get bought out in which the share holders get shafted while the insiders become rich.

The revenue has been increasing for past 4 years with profit margin 25. Yes, I know thats what the official 10K and 10Q reports say. Unfortunately, retail investors are rarely privy to accurate accounting data.

I dont understand how the PE can go from 15 to 90. If that is indeed true then is the company is cooking up data? Im confused lol. Yes and no. The problem is with how GAAP allows companies to categorize revenue, earnings, goodwill, free cash flow, etc. They get considerable optionality in what they include or dont include. This means company balance sheets are incompatible. Even if theyre in the same GICS subindustry, they are using a different set of criteria for what are putatively the same metrics. Additionally, they get penalized when their accountants arent savvy enough to play the game properly. Mind you, for the last two decades the correlation between stock prices and earnings has considerably strengthened. Investors expect earnings to continuously grow and beat analyst expectations. It is in the companies best interests to fudge the headline numbers to make themselves look as good as possible.

Im a software engineer, so the data center stuff made a ton of sense and kind of falls into buy what you know style of investing. Never try to think of myself as an expert, but at least using a screener has taught me discipline and how to find a style of investment. Pair that with being able to think for yourself about trends, you can see success. I always talk about thats the main reason why I think people underperform the market in general. They dont think for themselves and they dont do things like screen for companies, because that takes time and research. Much easier for people to get a tip from someone or online and run with it. Like some of the newer stuff Ive been buying into is around naval companies and components for drones. The naval stuff is because we are way behind in the US in what we need and we dont build here. The United States effectively gave up on commercial shipbuilding during the Reagan administration in the name of free trade. In the decades that followed, generous state subsidies helped China dominate commercial shipbuilding, and Beijings requirement that the sector be dualuse resulted in an industry that can shift to production and ship repair for the military during a conflict, much as U.S. shipyards did during World War II. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates that China now has 232 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States. China built almost half the worlds new ships in 2022, whereas U.S. shipyards produced just 0.13 percent Rebuilding the arsenal of democracy that anchored the U.S. victory at sea 80 years ago wont happen overnight or cheaplyit is a generational project. The 20year Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program aimed at upgrading dry docks, facilities, and equipment will end up costing well over the projected 21 billion But the plan is only intended to maximize existing U.S. industrial capacity and wont do much to close the enormous shipbuilding gap with China. That would require a reconstitution program on par with the series of maritime laws passed after World War I, which supported the expansion of an industrial base eventually capable of turning out thousands of carriers, destroyers, submarines, frigates, and cargo ships for the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.",Neutral,0,0.9996064305305481,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-16,"This is incorrect and you yelling louder doesnt make you right. IBKR fills are unquestionably better. RH is selling their fills which is how they do everything commission free. IBKR is smart routing to multiple exchanges so likely to get the better fill. When does this matter? Pretty much just when trading options otherwise it probably doesnt. Fidelity and IBKR are better if you trade options but I see zero reason why anyone would choose Schwab over RH. Schwab is a disaster right now with major issues btw their backend and TOS, loss of practically all their best talent bc management has gone to shit and probably all these issues stem from how poorly they played the interest rate hikes and the massive cuts they were forced to make bc of it. RH is designed and operated for the customer and trader and its UI is nice. Schwab makes their money on managed products and the overnight float so there isnt much incentive to improve the self directed customer experience. So point is IBKR or Fidelity if you trade options and RH if you are essentially an investor or trade intermittently. As a trader I prefer IBKR and use a separate futures broker and platform. I wish IBKR would be as proactive as RH but its a completely different business model and caters to a much more sophisticated client. How do I know this?

On top of that, the fact is the more you engage in a risky activity the greater the odds of something bad happening from said activity even if the odds are really really low. i.e. the average driver could correctly boast having a 100 safety record, but obviously youd rightly laugh in their face if they insisted that means theres zero chance that theyll ever get into a car accident. Even if you have a bunch of very safe drivers on the road, the more very safe drivers you have on the road the greater the odds that one of those very safe drivers will get into an accident, it happens every day because theres millions of them on the road.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"In the case of the taxable account the tax rate my current regular rate on the contribution and a lower capital gains rate on the gains. This is not the right way to think of it. The amount your taxable amount will grow is dependent on how much you start with, and that is impacted by your tax rate at contribution time. This means that your entire final balance in the taxable account reflects the impact of the taxes you pay upfront. Then you pay capital gains on top of that. You can never outrun the impact of that initial decision to pay some taxes. Every dollar you end up with is going to reflect being taxed as ordinary income at some point of the process. Heres a simpler way to think of it. Roth is always at least as good as taxable assuming you dont withdraw growth early. Its the same starting amount and the same growth, but with definitely no extra taxes instead of maybe no extra taxes at withdrawal. And Roth is easier to compare to Traditional, because it just comes down to which end you expect a better tax rate from at contribution time, or withdrawal time.

The safest way you can invest in stocks is to go 100 into VT and make regular contributions throughout your lifetime. Its a globally diversified index fund capturing essentially all investable developed and emerging markets. You cannot be more diversified in stocks than this, and although you could add bonds you shouldnt need to do that for at least another 15 years. The two things you should absolutely do right now are 1. Open an IRA if you havent already and start making regular contributions. You can do this on Robin Hood or through any other major brokerage. Doing this now will do more for future you than any other single thing. 2. Read Little Book of Common Sense Investing and The Psychology of Money. These more than anything on Reddit should guide your investing principles between now and retirement. These will teach you how to think about money and investing and make your own decisions.

So the investor would have to be a not a lawyer and not me b someone with an interest in highrisk, smallscale loans c someone with enough legal knowledge to evaluate. Thats a tough find. That brings us to this post to see if anyone could think of viable options for where I would find such an investor.",Neutral,0,0.9986036419868469,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-17,"I have a loose set of rules to compare securities. With AI, you might be able to compare company financial records. Its hard to compare companies on stats alone because banks have different financial statements than energy companies. I find bank financial statements very confusing. You have to be a bank to really understand banking statements. If i cant understand a companys financial statements, then I dont invest in that company. My rules are based on experience of exposure to risk. I invest by mitigating my exposure to risk and limiting my exposure to risk. My rules are flexible and have exceptions. For example, I never borrow money from anyone else in life. However, there are exceptions to the rule. I would borrow for a house or car. I also have credit cards that I pay off monthly. So, I do borrow when it is beneficial to me, not the banks. I do my best to never invest on margin. I just paid off my margin account, and it was 2400. I had to borrow when the market took a dump a few months ago, and I was short on cash. Another rule I have is I invest in companies that are solvent. This means they have as much cash or cash equivalents they can easily pay off their debts if they had to today. They also should have an excellent cash flow. Investing is an art and a science. Yes, the details matter. However, if you have no goal in mind other than just making money, then the details dont make much sense. Fear drives markets, not the details or stats.

Reddit,2024-10-17,"In the first part, yes, use them as a guideline. For the second part, its more like trying to figure out where the overall market is going based on current market and global conditions. For example, during the pandemic, I looked for and invested in an oil company because I figured there would be a surge in oil demand post pandemic whenever that would be. So, when people were selling oil stocks, I was buying as much and as often as I could. That was a pretty risky move because that became my number one position in my portfolio, and unfortunately, it still is my number one portfolio position. Its still an excellent position, and I dont regret it. Ive just had to purchase other positions to balance out the volatility of the portfolio. So, you can try to calculate a direction, but its more than that. Its more about a gut feeling based on experience of living in the world knowing fear and then monopolizing on that. Figure out what people really fear, than just market expansion or contraction. Math cant quantify emotions, and thats what drives markets. Fear of missing out drives markets up, and fear of losing value drives markets down. Consumer confidence is only one indicator and indicates what people feared, not what they will fear in the future. I equate market indicators to Doordash hotspots. If you ever did Doordash as a driver, you would understand. They indicate what happened in the past, which may or may not be relevant for now or in the future. There will always be a recession and then upswings. When they happen, be prepared. You can profit from either one. I always have cash or cash equivalents laying around earning money just in case a recession occurs and buy more of what I already own. When an upswing occurs, I tend to hold more than I sell. Im getting closer to my goals, so Im thinking of dipping my toes in swing trading.",Neutral,0,0.9477242827415466,Reply

I see this with software developers , can you pay a software developer 15k USD equivalent a year in India?

She said Yes, at your point in life, dividend reinvestment is a nobrainer. Ill get that going. I then asked to reinvest the cash dividends in the stock. She said ok.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"I actually think that its the opposite. Edward Jones isnt structured as a corporation with corporate officers. Its a limited partnership. The largest partner is Jones Financial. And the smaller percentage are employee partners, there are over 20k employee partners iirc. Imo that type of structure is really hard to scale well because there is little independent governance of the company. And no external investor influence. This type of outsourcing could seriously backfire in the long term if the younger and more successful investment advisers who are not yet partners start to leave Eddiejones. l I do think that many investment advisers do care about their clients and building their book of business. And if an investment adviser isnt able to service their clients they are not incentivized to stay. When investment advisers leave often a big chunk of their book goes with them. So firms like eddiejones, etc. etc. live and die by retaining their investment advisers. And there is a lot of competition among these firms and the large wire houses to recruit successful investment advisers. And RIA platforms and TAMP services like those from Fidelity, Schwab, Pershing, SEI, etc. cater and compete for advisers who want to go independent. Its no secret in the industry that LPL have been poaching successful eddiejones investment advisers. So at eddiejones you end up with investment advisers who either are trying to become a partner or really good ones leave to become their own RIA or they join another firm with their clients. In the long run if the reason for this type of outsourcing by eddiejones is for labor arbitrage, it is likely to fail in spectacular fashion.",Neutral,0,0.9988270401954651,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-14,"Actually, I take the bond comment back if you simply want to get used to seeing them in a portfolio and how they interact with equities. Might make it easier to increase as time goes by too. Regarding international equities, they are roughly 40 of market cap so the better question to ask yourself is why exclude them? They offer diversification, the only free lunch in investing, and there are plenty of products you probably own that arent made in the USA. Why limit your exposure, and possibly risk, to one single country over a 60 year investment horizon? Material I would also personally combine your large cap growth with total stock market since they have a pretty similar exposure. Rapid growth is an interesting term to use since theres no way to guarantee rapid growth from one sector to happen. I would think more about dividend investing in a taxable brokerage too theres a good chance youd be paying more in taxes than something that wasnt spitting out as many dividends. Lastly, small cap would be a good hedge against large cap stocks as well and might improve overall returns if you have the conviction to stick with it and it makes up more than 15 or 20 of your US equities since anything less wont move the needle too much. I would make sure it either tracks the SP SmallCap 600 Value Index, or is an actively managed but well constructed fund such as the AVUV ETF from Avantis.",Neutral,0,0.9489768743515015,Reply

I researched on my own and eventually opened IRA but still was naive enough to not contribute every year. Eventually, I became more intelligent. Just before Covid hit, I was looking at investing 100k that I had been saving. I thought its a big amount, I need a FA to help me invest properly. I met few but wasnt sold on any. So, I decided to do it on my own and I am glad the portfolio has been doing good. Over the last 4 years it has been at least matching SP. We now have a brokerage account, HSA, 2 Roth IRAs and 2 401ks. All retirement accounts have 3 funds FSELX, FXAIX, and VTI in 106030 allocation.

In your case, I think it is safe to assume, between your parents, your wifes parents and your grandparents, you two are likely to get significant inheritance combined mid 6 figures or may be even more.

You cannot buy an Nvidia card and just throw it into an existing server. Sadly, they are ordered with specific power supplies and cooling to support these cards. If anyone wants to buy and run a Nvidia card for anything, it needs a new server with an Intel or AMD processor in it. To make it more profitable for Intel and AMD, you can only stack a handful of the Nvidia cards into a server and the server requires two processors minimum to fully populate the PCI bus with enough bandwidth for the cards.

Reddit,2024-10-28,I never really thought about it in terms of the greeks. I just did some backtesting and found that ATM or very slightly OTM leaps were best for average return.

Reddit,2024-10-28,"I went into a bit of detail on some of these in my reply to jwp_93 but to summarize I buy around 5 above the ATM price. Option pricing is the main reason I went for XLP. Like, a QQQ leap is the price of 11 shares but an XLP leap is only the cost of 7 shares which could theoretically make up for XLPs lackluster performance. If you meant on a time basis like stocks just went down 30 so volatility is high and options are more expensive I dont take that into account because I dont try to time the market. Never really thought about the greeks, just saw in backtesting that slightly OTM leaps performed better I wont be switching to TQQQ. I wish I could say it was for mathoptimization reasons but I have the if it aint broke dont fix it attitude at this point. I spent a long time forming this strategy 6 years ago and the thought of digging out my old backtesting scripts and updating them with the last few years of data and testing a new leveraged stock strategy against my options strategy to see if maybe its a little better doesnt sound appealing.",Neutral,0,0.9989161491394043,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-28,"Wolfram alpha is great for many situations... For many nottoo crazy equations, it can replace Matlab or Maple, while being more accessible because its less strict on the syntax. Not to mention the free version, which I suppose can be a life saver if you dont get a Matlab license from your school. I have to say, though, that when I discovered Chegg while doing my first semester in engineering physics, I got a monthly subscription and kept it for the whole 4 years. YMMV, though. We were a small program, and most professors didnt use textbooks and created their own material. On every single homework, I didnt even know how to approach 50 of the problems. No textbook in the library had worked examples of similar problems. Chegg often had one worked example of a problem that was at least remotely similar to what I had on my homework assignment. Many professors offered very little office hours, and often at times when I couldnt possibly go... So if it wasnt for Chegg, I was 100 on my own. On the other hand, I had friends in mechanical engineering, and typically the lecturer followed some textbook that contained tons of examples. Basically, they used the nonworkedout problems in the book as homework assignments. In that case, I can see how Chegg is either not worth it, or used by lazy people to have someone else do their homework. As I said, YMMV.",Neutral,0,0.9997096657752991,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-26,"Yeah, I agree, Ive built some models for our sales team thats really great fitting to the past data, but generally is mediocre at predicting future sales results. However, creating dynamically weighted ensemble models while making future forecasts more conservative tends to help with longer term accuracy for us. Our precision tends to be low on a weeklymonthly basis, higher on quarterly, but weve achieved 90 accuracy on year long projections. There is a massive difference though between forecasting something like sales versus the stock market returns, because forecasts can have an impact on the return itself selffulfilling prophecy. Its much better in my opinion to create more narrow projections and model outcomes based on other indicators.

Very few here hedge. your bullet points are cool, but not going to read them. Go buy some Puts if you dont want to take your profits at 141. That will give you the ability to make some money in the event of a decline. IE, buy the 126 put and you can sell your shares at 126.

Something that alot of people dont know is that Redwire is also helping Xbow systems with the SRM production by supplying the company with structures for their bolt family of rockets. 3. Moon Mars. Redwire has lunar and martian optionality, they have multiple different lunar contract like MASON with NASAtipping point which is for building landing pads and roads using regolith VSAT which is a partnership with the company astrobotic where Redwire is providing ROSA arrays of various sizes to provide power for the lunar surface.
