Finally knocked out some of my higher priced shares and Im in a better position with AMD than I was a week ago. The drop so far is now down back below my average. I will scoop up some more shares down here. Mm shares below my average mm gimme. I just trade expensive shares like this fractionally. I had worked up to AMD 6 shares usually in 0.1 increments as it dropped recently, then sold the upper half ASAP at bare minimum profit on the way back up. Now I just have 3 157 shares. Almost in the green with it still. Tempted to buy a whole share right now after hours. Edit Just to clarify since its not clear to me why Im being downvoted, my main focus is on building a strong position with shares bought below my average price. When I sell a few shares at minimal profit, its simply to reduce my cost basis by offloading higherpriced shares. This way, I hold onto shares I consider wellpositioned for gains, while ensuring my average cost remains as low as possible. The goal, really, is for every single stock in my portfolio to be green in terms of total gl, while at the same time, if things dont go well which they sometimes do not, trying to reach but not exceed 3k in realized losses. These are the incentives that have been put in place AFAIK, so Im just trying to maximize the possible utility within them."

My aim isnt to capture large, taxable gains in the short term, but to incrementally improve my position, even if that means taking some small profits to optimize my cost basis.

If it works with a lot of money, it works with a little bit of money. Strategically optimizing your positions doesnt depend on the size of the investment. I use fractional trading to test the waters and keep control of my gains and losses. You all seem to be misunderstanding my approach as merely chasing small gains when really its about building up a more resilient position in whatever I want to invest in long term. Also, no, Im not a wealthy Richy Rich type figure. I have some spare change and Im throwing it around as logically and mathematically rationally as I can."

They were above 50 through 2023. Through 2024, their CAGR looks like itll be dropping to around 38. If they maintain a similar unit sales volume in 2025, itll drop to 30. Not good. Tesla has a forward PE of over 72 right now, which will be even higher tomorrow. Other OEMs, who have performed far better than Tesla recently, are sitting around forward PEs of 57. Teslas valuation heavily relies on the idea of constant future growth. Their robotaxi event was generally scoffed at. Not good. It was fairly expected theyd beat estimates, and given how shit the stock has been lately, that often leads to a short term pump. I could see a 61.8 retracement by the end of the month from wherever its high is over the next 12 days probably right around 240, dropping to 222. Then I imagine itll pop back up to a lower high around 250255. Then, its likely all down from there, likely back down to around the 160175 area by beginning of next year... lining up with quarterly sales figures which I dont expect to be spectacular. Maybe it beats last year, but that isnt saying much when they were previously claiming a 50 CAGR. Why this stock is worth so much more than other auto OEMs is probably a question a lot of major investors are asking themselves. A lot of them were betting on autonomous taxis... but Musk can only claim its 12 years away for so long before they eventually start to wise up. 10 years... hes been claiming that every year for 10 years straight now The stocks a dog, Meme investors just dont know it yet. Its been in a long term downward trend, no doubt supported by a core of buy and hold forever insiders and cultists, and of course SP index funds that will only sell if everyone else does.

Point being that the best time to buy Meta was when it was down and they were going through struggles. Same with Netflix. Same with Amazon. Same with Palantir. Same with Crowdstrike earlier this year. Its literally just the same thing over and over again. Buy financially sound companies when theyre down and you will do well.

Its a pretty massive chunk of their total net income for having to do absolutely nothing to get it save sell the cars they were going to sell anyways. Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus 7.069 billion last year, or 32 lower yy. Remove the 700 million extra in regulatory credits yy, and it would have been closer to 4.1 billion or a 42 drop in income yy on their actual product sales. Theyre on course to just about match their total unit vehicle sales yy theyre still a bit behind last year through Q3. The problem is that their long term guidance which helped lead to the run up overvaluation in the stock price is 50 CAGR between 2020 and 2030. They rescinded that guidance in Q3 23 because they dont believe its possible anymore. To stay even with the 50 CAGR in 2024, theyd have need to sell over 2.5 million vehicles, but theyre on course to sell about 1.8 million. 2025 could see little if any sales growth versus 20232024. However, to maintain the 50 CAGR in 2025, theyd have to hit 3.8 million vehicle sales. Starting to see the problem? Their forward PE is based on crazy growth guidance, which even Tesla has admitted they cant hit, yet the stock is still trading at a forward PE of over 80. Most of the major OEMs across the world trade a forward PE of between 5 and 7. Teslas sales arent growing, their revenue isnt growing, and their income isnt growing, which means their PE is based on nothing more than a hope and a dream. It seems to me that for the second year in a row, Tesla will only see an annual profit on account of government subsidies and regulatory credit sales."

They dont count EV tax credits anywhere since they dont receive them directly. Although... Im not sure how that applies to leases, tbh. Their regulatory credit sales, counted as 100 profit margin, are 700 million higher than last year through the first 3 quarters. In Q3, regulatory credit sales accounted for 34 of their total net income. Tesla once again lives on subsidies, whether theyre paid by the government, or other OEMs are forced to pay them to Tesla through regulations... which essentially points out just how excessively Teslas vehicles are subsidized. 7500 federal tax credit 1500 5000 state tax credit Hard to say how much theyre getting from EV regulatory credit sales per Tesla sold, but my guess would be around 2000 per vehicle. Add it all up, and Tesla could be getting subsidized on 25 of the total sale price of their vehicles. EV tax credits benefit Tesla in that Tesla can raise their MSRPs to offset the value of the tax credit, thus taking an equivalent amount of revenue profit"

The question is, will Tesla still be the leader or at least a strong 2nd place when EVs are 98 of the market. There will always be hobbyist and specialty use ICE vehicles, so itll never be 100 but it should be close. If you dont believe EVs are the primary future of passenger vehicles, you probably shouldnt be in Tesla in the first place, but there are hydrogen believers. Still. FWIW, I think its a strong probabilty that they will be. China is the only real concern, I dont see any serious challenge to Tesla dominance coming from anywhere else. On the other hand, China is doing well, and a governmentbacked Chinese company has ... not quite unlimited funding for expansion, but ... a lot. There is a real risk though that Tesla is regulated into failure in the US and Europe as political revenge for Elons activities, Teslas antiunion position, or both. If not actually shutting Tesla down with red tape, then subsidizing some competition that otherwise wouldnt be a viable threat. There has also always been a real risk that Elon says something intemperate that wrecks the China relationship China has a history anyway of letting foreign companies in to learn their technology before regulating them out or subsidizing the locals enough to push out the foreigners. It didnt happen that way to Apple and may not happen that way to Tesla if they also export enough Chinesemade product to be a net benefit for the Chinese... theres reason to be hopeful. Provided that Elon doesnt retweet any Winnie the Pooh memes, of course. Anyway, Im not selling my TSLA position, and odds are IMO reasonable, but it would be a mistake to think that dominating the emerging market in any way guarantees dominating the mature market."

No disrespect, but youve unintentionally proven my point here by bringing emotions into it by calling me biased instead of just objectively looking at the company fundamentals that were released today. all of your examples had PE ratios less than 20 during their crashes Amazon had a PE of 200 during their struggles in 2013 and has never had a PE anywhere near 20. Palantir has never had a PE anywhere near 20 in their existence, and it was at a forward PE of 200 when they were struggling Crowdstrike has never had a PE anywhere near 20 and had a PE of 300 when they were struggling and dropping earlier this year. For all of my examples to have a PE below 20 its odd how most of them dont. Edit, because rereading your comment Im getting more lost Its not the same thing over and over. Cisco, blackberry, and IBM were all financially sound yet their stock prices never recovered. IBM is literally at all time highs so I dont have a clue what youre referencing there.

We really dont know what long term environmental impact the mining sites for the battery materials are having though, or what frontloading a high load of emissions is having, such as the difference in manufacturing a BEV w a large battery, versus manufacturing an ICEV Hybrid PHEV. Sure, traditional OEMs dont have to report the billions in from environmental damage, however, Teslas vehicles dont all run on 100 renewable energy, so they too benefit from not paying for environmental damage caused by the electricity production their cars use to move. Im all about carbon taxes and taxes on practices that damage the environment to level the playing field, and preferably to move more people way from owning driving personal vehicles so much. Its the only fair way to go about it IMO. Key is that a carbon tax would actually give a huge benefit to people who ride public transit, ride bikes and PEVs, work from home, or in those workers at businesses that implement 4 day work weeks. Something the EV subsidy programs arent doing. Plus, carbon environmental taxes impact all facets of life, not just transportation. From the amount of electricity we use at home, the amount of hot water we use, the foods we eat, the things we buy, etc... The government is spending a LOT of money on a solution thats doing far too little. The regulatory credit policies are, IMO, not having the impact they were intended to have. Their primary result has been to build cash in Teslas coffers and make Elon Musk the richest man on the planet, and starve other initiatives of much needed capital. Hell, we could have spent the 30 billion in subsidies that went to Tesla painting bike lanes and had a much larger environmental impact."

It does beg the question though, how can a project with an endless timeline ever truly fail? Afterall, FSD has been claimed to be 12 years away from completion for 10 straight years now. Millions of Robotaxis were going to hit the roads in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and now 2025... If they fail 2025, itll be 2026, then 2027. Meanwhile, other real services are already operating, so investors claim of Tesla instantly enabling robotaxis and quickly gaining a monopoly on not just autonomous taxi services, but all taxi services, instantly wiping out millions of taxi driver jobs...is a bit far fetched. The more we really consider the complexities, the more unrealistic it sounds. Hell, Musk is now saying that 2025 will only see robotaxis in some regions of Texas and California... not the nationwide rollout he originally claimed with a simple OTA update. Then of course theres the hardware concerns... now the claim is HW3 may not actually be able to operate the software. New cars are on HW4... and now Musk is claiming an HW5 is coming thats well beyond enough power to operate a robotaxi... the same thing he said about HW4... How about those robots though... those look anywhere close to ready to anyone? I mean, they were talking to people at robotaxi day... even if it was a human talking through a speaker... Why would I add back in 622 million in restructuring? Did they not benefit this quarter and part of last by not having to pay wages to all the people they laid off? They laid people off because their demand wasnt where they needed it to be, and had they kept those people on staff, Teslas financials would have been in far worse shape right now. As Ive mentioned in my comments, 740 million in net profits from regulatory credit income on a total net income of 2.2 million isnt a small size. It accounts for 33.5 of their total quarterly profit. And thats just the regulatory carbon credits... it doesnt include federal state EV tax credits, solar tax credits, battery storage tax credits, tax abatements, etc..."

Keep in mind, a massive chunk of their remaining net income comes from government subsidies. In the US for example, theyre still seeing 7500 federal tax credits on a large percentage of their total sales which allows them to maintain higher MSRPs, translating into higher profit margins. Most of their sales are in states with state EV tax credits as well, often in the 15002500 range. Some as high as 5000. Their energy sales are even more subsidized than their car sales. The federal government subsidizes something like 30 of the overall cost of a solar panel home battery storage installation. States with the highest rooftop solar adoption rates often have additional incentives on top. Overall, it can reach up to 50. Im not sure on their grid scale power storage, but Im guessing the subsidies andor the amount theyre charging the government, which often has mandates written into law to have storage installed, are lucrative. Like 2023... if Tesla were to exclude regulatory credit income and government subsidies from their income, theyd likely be reporting a loss for 2024. I guess this doesnt technically matter unless there were a risk that the subsidies were going to disappear in short order.. which theres no sign of. Some headwinds for Q4 Theyve removed their lowest priced trim model 3 near the end of Q3, which had the imported Chinese LFP battery. That could hit their overall sales numbers in Q4. It also means theyre not going to sell cars with the significantly cheaper LFP packs, which likely generated some decent profit margins. These units didnt qualify for the full tax credit on sales although I do believe they still qualified on leases, which Tesla would have had to roll into the lease price. Not sure if they did or didnt do that. They significantly cut the price of the Cybertruck and still dont seem to have a backlog after the price cut per their estimated delivery dates on their site. Theyve significantly cut the prices on their inventory vehicles. Model 3s Ive seen have up to 3k discounts applied. Model Y has as much as 4k discounts applied. Model Y accounts for the majority of their sales. That said, they were also aggressively discounting inventory vehicles last year in Q4. Theyre offering 0 financing offers which I believe is new this year. While this wont impact their unit sales, it will mean additional losses of up to 5k per vehicle over the course of the loan that they otherwise would have made on interest. I do expect Tesla to break their sales numbers from last year, if only because theyre so deeply discounting their vehicles. However, I expect their revenue and net income to be down in Q4 yy as a result of their deep discounting."

The idea is simple. The theory is pretty simple. The actual construction of something that is as good or better than a human at performing a job.... Very difficult. We did not succeed and the project was cancelled. Now we were a motley crew to say the least most of my coworkers were Serbian and frankly not very intelligent. Nevertheless, I dont foresee the brightest minds solving the problem. I equate the problem of having a computer do human tasks like driving a car to putting a man on the moon, curing HIV, or harnessing nuclear fusion. The THEORY is straightforward. The implementation often requires the literal invention of new elements and materials in the case of NASAs Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. So we know at a high level how to build FSD. I guarantee the guys at Tesla working on it have the theory nailed down. The implementation is what they are struggling with. Like driving, perfection is required to get people to and from space safely, cure HIV, or harness nuclear fusion. This is not shit that can be wrong half the time or even 20 of the time like ChatGPT. ChatGPT is childs play compared to FSD. Elon being an arrogant idiot failed and probably still fails to realize why FSD is more like nuclear fission than BonziBuddy."

That is denial of reality. These sources of income exist and they are not going away anytime soon. It does beg the question though, how can a project with an endless timeline ever truly fail? When the investment community stops believing and the markets stop considering Tesla an AI stock. I dont know exactly when or how that could happen, but at some point, people could lose faith and Teslas 800 Billion market cap would deflate. I can see some scenarios A competitor like Waymo achieves FSD first and takes over the space entirely. Tesla itself writes off Billions of dollars of AI training hardware if it becomes apparent that current Neural Net software methodologies are insufficient and the datacenters they set up are useless. Ive seen similar writedowns in the biotech space a company finds that their path on a project is on a dead end and they sell off all the equipment for that project. Governments deem Teslas AI projects to be dangerous and either regulate them out of existence or seize them outright. I believe that for the next few years, TSLA will continue to inflict psychological and possibly financial harm on everyone TSLA bulls with blind faith in Musk will insist that the company is much more valuable than its market cap, and be continually upset by erratic earnings and uncertain progress with no guarantee of success. TSLA bears who hate the company will keep harping on its market cap as overinflated and be continually upset by the multihundreds of Billions valuation. Most people IMO should avoid having anything to do with TSLA either long or short. I actively tell anyone I know to avoid TSLA. The vast majority of people I know who had anything to do with this stock from 20112020 lost money, and a lot of it, no matter how they tried to play it."

And looking at the graph now, from an ATH of 200 they went down to 100 in 2020 and they are now at 230. Not too bad. And considering they are one of the most important actors in quantum computing, they will probably continue growing at a good pace. Blackberry is a completely different story. It is true that before the turndown, no one saw it coming. Essentially, no one saw the iPhone coming. Once the iPhone was out, it was clear from the first day that it was a gamechanger. Every possible actor had to react very quickly or die sooner or later. The most evident victims were Nokia and BB. Google was able to react quickly by removing the keyboard from Android. The first versions did not support virtual keyboards I guess everyone remembers Steve Ballmer laughing at a phone that cost 500 and didnt even have a keyboard. It took them a few years to move to Android, and by then, it was way too late. I didnt have any shares on BB back then, but I would have dumped them shortly after seeing that the only BB business model was no longer relevant and that they were not reacting to the changes. With Tesla, although it is clear they will not keep growing the way they did before, it seems unlikely that today they will follow the path BB took. Together with the Chinese EV manufacturers, they are the reference right now. And Tesla has other businesses besides the cars that make them relevant. The influence of Musk is another story, though."

I specifically noted the high front loading of high emissions. Why did I mention this? The planet can only sequester so much carbon over a given period. What happens if we significantly increase the amount of carbon we produce in a given year on account of a manufacturing process that spikes the levels of emissions? What are the impacts to the environment? Does it result in more ocean acidification, because the CO2 is sucked up by the oceans instead of the forests? Thus leading to devastation of coral reefs and oceanic plant life, and styming the Oceans ability to sequester more carbon? Again, not something covered in cradle to grave assessments.. Sure, power grids are changing... slowly... and will continue to do so over time. That doesnt mean there arent significantly better solutions to the environmental problem than simply MOAR CARS!. Were to the point where every bit of CO2 we inject into the atmosphere will likely require more energy and time to suck back out of the atmosphere in the future with CO2 sequestration processes. IMO, the best solution is to not emit in the first place. We, humans, need to drastically reduce our carbon footprints in a very short period of time. BEVs help, never said they dont.

Teslas also recently lowered prices or at least no longer requires an expensive package which consists of software and whats essentially a few cheap pieces of plasticmetal, and its pretty clear from their order page that theres no backlog remaining for this vehicle. At least, not at these prices. We also know that CT sales seem to be cannibalizing model SX sales... or maybe SX customers are just going the way of the dodo, and new buyers came in to buy the CT. Maybe a mix of both. Either way, theyre trading two high cost potentially high margin vehicles for one. Cars still make up the lions share of their revenue. Both divisions rely on large orders of cells. One cant exist without the other. If car sales slow down, Tesla offloads excess cells through their energy division. It just so happens that their energy products are subsidized to a much larger percentage than their vehicles. How large the overall market is for their energy products is anyones guess. Frankly, Liion isnt exactly the most cost effective way for storing energy in a static location. Solar roof seems to generally be a failure of a product. Ironically, their powerwall sales would likely be far lower if they actually allowed V2L capabilities in their nonCT vehicles. Its a a conflict of interest for them to enable V2L capabilities in their vehicles, which is kind of silly when you think about it. Theyre screwing the customer intentionally to pad their own pocketbooks. I imagine Other revenue may have been FSD. Remember that near the end of the quarter, Tesla started offering 0 financing, but only if you bought FSD. It essentially made FSD cost like 1k or something after all was said and done. Early in Q4 now... Teslas removed that requirement and is now just offering 0 financing on their model 3 and Y with no need to buy FSD. Theyre also discounting their model 3 Y inventory by 2k 4k. Not listening to the earnings call so dont know what hes saying about their forecast, but I doubt it... Without a new lower priced model, or deeply discounting their existing models, their market isnt large enough. We dont know where the economy will be next year, but it could certainly worsen. It seems calls for a recession arent as large as they have been, but I can certainly see some economic troubles. Growing credit card debt, credit card defaults, and auto loan defaults dont just magically go away. The real question is where will this magic increase in volume come from? 30 volume growth is an additional 540,000 vehicles produced and sold. They have no new factories under construction AFAIK. I cant see CT sales volumes growing much without significant price cuts, and I definitely dont think theyll be selling over 100k of them next year. Much like the F150L, I think there was the initial pent up demand, but once its out, its going to be a long slog to growth in that sector. Also, where are they planning to grow their sales? The US? Europe? China? Im guessing China, where they very well may be expanding havent heard much news on that front lately. However, if theyre expanding, theyre expanding at a time when all of the Chinese OEMs are also rapidly expanding. Somehow I dont think Teslas market will grow by 440k units in China in one year. Although... I mean China just enabled their government to buy Tesla vehicles... the first foreign brand theyve ever enabled that for. China also seems to be abnormally beholden to Tesla for some reason."

Dont get me wrong, I own a small vehicle, and can see the benefit of more people buying smaller, but the reality is, people arent buying smaller vehicles.

So its no doubt going to eventually enter a cyclical downturn, and when that happens the fall is going to be absolutely brutal to people buying anywhere close to the top who didnt sell. To be clear, I dont know exactly when NVDA will start to fall a bunch from the cyclical downturn, but I know that itll definitely happen. Even if it doesnt happen for say 2 to 3 more years, I dont think that risks vs reward are worth getting in now at todays valuation."

Most people have 0 clue what they are talking about when mentioning Intel Bad management According to reddit CEO Gelsinger is responsible for the failure of Intel. Although he will likely be the saviour of it instead. Intel is a massive slow moving ship that takes time to redirect. He took over from a bunch of MBA finance people with a lack of engineer background. These are the people that had Intel stuck in the mad and innovation was nonexistant. Instead they tried to milk every penny without innovating. Intel is too far behind Since Gelsinger a new strategy called 5 nodes in 4 years has been implemented. They currently are on schedule to make the deadlines. Normally Intel should be far behind the likes of AMD but if you look at their new sierra forest server processer they are unexpectedly on par with AMD. In the next two years they will also release backside power delivery which will be a massive innovation that TSMC hasnt pulled off yet. Intel is too far gone People would make you believe as if Intel is going bankrupt. Whilst in reality theyre creating lots of cashprofit if you ignore their fabs investment. They already secured 15bn in contracts from Microsoft for their 18a chips to be released in 2026. Remember they are on schedule and they are already testing these 18a chips. If they are succesful it will likely put intel on parity in semi fabs with TSMC. These chips are made by the newest semi machines. The ones that TSMC didnt want at first and eventually backtracked and got anyways after Intel initially got them. Intels moneymakers are still making money and will continue to make money. Although AMD has enjoyed a slight lead and was ahead of Intel for a while. Intel is just in time to catch back up and getting things back on track. Foundry is a whole different question. However, I think governments and companies have woken themselves up after the last Covid chip shortage. They realize they cannot be reliant on one manufacturer and need to diversify. Intel will play into that with their new fabs. The question remains if they can pull it off. My instinct would be yes. How in earth would they otherwise be able to compete with AMD in pricevalue for years after AMD went fabless? Although I dont see foundry adding a great amount of profits. Manufacturing isnt a highly profitable sector. But I think it will add enough value to get Intel to about 300500bn market cap. With the AI hype you could potentially add another 100200bn on top of that. But I think in 24 years the market will be calmed down and somewhat saturated and these crazy profit margins at NVDA will be gone."

The risks are if Intel has issues making sales that slows their ability to finance their fab construction which sets them back further. Intel needs the fab business to succeed for this plan to pay off. Also their chip sales slumped recently due to bad press about voltage issues which Intel was way too slow to address. They are laying off workers which may slow their ability to produce chipsrevenue and they suspended their dividend this month because they are hurting for cash. Their CEO is gambling the farm on the fabs working out and it might work out, or it may fail spectacularly, in which case Intel would likely go into a death spiral and cease to exist.

Gradually it stabilizes it wont be AMD it definitely wont be Nvidia but it stabilizes and you gradually get back to maybe the 30s as a start. A turnaround, but one that wont likely happen overnight. B. Intel doesnt improve, stumbles along, tries to sell some assets to buy time and maybe succeeds for a while, eventually without a successful plan things start to erode more quickly. C. Intel gets worse more quickly, has to sell assets under distress. _____________ IMO, A really does likely require good new management to have a material chance at happening. I think Intel does have assets of considerable value, but I dont know how much I trust current management to be able to realize that value well. With things as they currently are, I think B or C is more likely. In the ultra short term, its considerably technically oversold, so an oversold bounce wouldnt be surprising."

TSMC publicly held off on purchase of the most advanced lithography machines for a time because they said the sales opportunity wouldnt justify the CAPEX yet. Intel moved forward with it. But they are different companies and operational efficiency and practices like continuous improvement programs will determine who offers the better product for the better price or better margins, or higher yield. Theres a lot more to it than 100B of machines come in one end and profit comes out the other end, otherwise a dozen companies would be doing it. Intel does have a real chance here to pull ahead with the most advanced product and charge absurd margins to the right buyer. NVDA right now may be willing to pay double the cost per wafer even if it only makes the chips 10 more efficient, for example. The headwind is that INTC has higher labor costs by far, has a history of mismanagement and infighting that sure seems to be pervasive throughout many levels of the company, and they have to learn on the fly how to service customers dropping multibillion dollar orders instead of only working for an internal customer that can be bullied by top management. TSMC has been doing this for decades and customers know what to expect from them Intel needs new customers to go out on a limb and spend billions designing a product to use Intel silicon with the hope that they will deliver it in a couple years like TSMC does."

If US enacts some legislation that sectors like transportation, industrial, defense, aerospace, telecom must use US silicon, then all of a sudden INTC is well positioned and cost concerns melt away. Really its an unproven business model and we dont know if its going to work at all. I opened a small position after the last crash because it seemed like the market finally started to realize how difficult Intels path ahead is.

                    "text": "Im not sure youve gotten a straight answer on your actual question. This is all ignoring whether your allocation makes sense or not,. The answer is no, the specific accounts that investments are in doesnt matter when it comes to exposureallocation, what matters is your total overall allocation. When you decide on an allocation percentage, you should be thinking in terms of total of all retirement investments, no matter where those investments live. However, tax implications mean there are reasons to put particular investments in particular accounts. In particular, holdings that generate significant taxable distributions highdividend stocks or funds, most bonds should go into taxadvantaged accounts to limit tax drag. Holdings that are primarily capital gains e.g. growth stocks or naturally taxadvantaged e.g. municipal bonds experience less drag in taxable accounts. When rebalancing, you also want to do rebalancing within taxadvantaged accounts as much as possible to again limit the tax drag of realizing capital gains. This results in a couple implications 1. You generally want to keep bonds and other dividendheavy funds in taxadvantaged accounts like your IRA. Though there are exceptions to this if you arent really expecting bonds to grow perhaps not paying capital gains on the larger expected growth from growth stocks in a Roth would outweigh the tax drag from having bonds in a taxable account. How this weighs out depends a lot on how well you expect to be able to manage your capital gains tax rates and what your expected ordinary income tax rates are. 2. You also want enough of each of your components in taxadvantaged accounts that you can do necessary rebalancing purely within those accounts. 3. Otherwise just worry about total allocations across all your retirement investments. Note that you can still sell bonds for cash even if they are in an inaccessible IRA. You just sell stocks for cash from your taxable account, and simultaneously sell bonds in your IRA and use those proceeds to buy stocks in your IRA. This effectively is equivalent to selling bonds for cash, though there are potential implications around realizing taxable events."

                    "text": "As far as your overall savings, it can be split up by savings goals, so x amount is for retirement and x amount for a house, etc. You would have different fixed income allocations for each goal based on how much time you have until you need to be able to spend the money. The aggregate of the different allocations for different goals tells you your overall allocation thats appropriate. Separate from that, or at least coexisting, is what money you have in different accounts. Money in tax advantaged accounts is inherently mostly for retirement because of the limitations on accessing it prior to retirement age, but money is fungible, meaning any dollar is the same as any other. Just because money in a 401k wont be spent until retirement doesnt mean it has to be invested like it wont be spent until retirement. If you have significant other savings in taxable accounts you may be better off putting most of your fixed income assets in tax advantaged accounts and holding mostly equities in the taxable accounts. The reason is that fixed income assets generate capital gains regularly, so in a taxable account youre paying tax on those gains every year even if you arent selling, but a tax advantaged account lets you avoid capital gains tax. If there will be a period where youll have lower taxable income in the future, like in between when you stop working and when you need to start taking rmds and social security, you can realize gains in a taxable account at a lower tax rate. Having only equities in a taxable account and needing to spend some of that money doesnt mean that youre relying on selling at a good price as long as you have the bonds or whatever to cover that expense in a tax advantaged account. Say you need to spend 20k and your taxable account is all in equities which happen to all be down significantly that year. If you sell 20k worth of stock to free up cash and at the same time, in a tax advantaged account you sell 20k worth of bonds and buy 20k worth of equities, then you effectively got that 20k cash from the bonds in your 401k and shifted more of your money into the 401k at the same time without the additional tax burden from actually withdrawing from the 401k. Im already my employer match on my 401k. When people say to prioritize an ira after getting the employer match in a 401k, that doesnt mean you shouldnt contribute further to the 401k if you have additional money to save for retirement. You should be hitting 401k contribution limits before considering saving retirement money in a taxable account. Prioritizing an ira isnt even always necessary, its based on the fact that a lot of 401k plans have high fees and not great options for funds. If yours is reasonable then go ahead and fully fund that before an ira. Also, 401k vs ira is another place that account allocation doesnt have to be the same as allocation for money dedicated to a goal. Often a sp500 is the cheapest option in a 401k and the sp500 represents about half the equities market, so you might have most of the money in your 401k in a sp500 fund and use the ira to get exposure to the rest of the market with lower cost funds. Your overall allocation for retirement money is still market weight or whatever your goal is, but within each account it can be very different."

If your goal is to keep a 60 usa stock 20 ex usa stock 20 bonds if for example you go USA stock in your 401k bonds stock in IRA ex USA in taxable the problem with this is if your bonds go up and you want to rebalance is sometimes hard to do this as you may be limited , you cant really just pull out bonds from your IRA and put them in your 401k or something"

The company sold 112.5 million common shares at 143 each, a 7.7 discount from its previous closing price of 155.01. Additionally, Boeing issued 5 billion in depositary shares tied to preferred shares. This capital infusion addresses urgent financial needs under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, especially given the ongoing strike that has halted production of the 737 Max, Boeings key product. The company is projected to use approximately 4 billion in cash in Q4, resulting in an estimated 14 billion free cash outflow for the year. Boeing anticipates continuing cash losses into the first half of next year as it works to ramp up production poststrike. The stock closed down 2.8 at 150.69 on Monday and has seen a 42 decline this year, marking one of the worst performances in the Dow Jones Industrial Average also if youre looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation"

If Jensen said that Musk was a moron that doesnt know how to use their products effectively, he would risk losing one of their largest customers. Why would he do that?"

The people leading tech companies are not computer science PHDs. They have MBAs, or are college dropouts that founded their company. So they are making huge decisions on AI investment without understanding the underlying science. Ai has some valid uses, but the business world is vastly overestimating its potential. They are mostly just copying each other trying to compete for as many gpus as they can order, kind of like how 34 years ago they went on a huge hiring spree competing for talent.

The truth is probably that their competitors slowly expanded their clusters over time to meet their needs, whereas musk just charged in and ordered 100,000 GPUs and built it all at once, because he is late to the market and trying to catch up. So technically, this is the truth, he built a 100,000 GPU cluster in 19 days while their competitors scaled to 100,000 over the span of a year, because they had no need to scale faster. Jensen is spinning a huge bulk purchase as being superhuman. The engineers that built the cluster certainly did a good job and deserve credit, but Jensen painting the accomplishment as a superhuman feat is just a 400 iq way to make your customer feel good about giving you Billions of dollars and wanting to continue that trend."

Meta AI Research SuperCluster Compute Power 16,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs Overview In early 2022, Meta formerly Facebook announced its AI Research SuperCluster RSC, which employs 16,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to accelerate AI research and development. 3. Microsoft and OpenAI Compute Power Estimated 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs Overview Microsoft built a supercomputer for OpenAI featuring 285,000 CPU cores and 10,000 GPUs as of 2020. Given ongoing investments and the scale of models like GPT4, its likely that their GPU count has increased, but specific numbers are undisclosed. 4. Google Compute Power Utilizes custom Tensor Processing Units TPUs Overview Google employs its own TPUs instead of GPUs. Their TPU v4 pods offer up to 1 exaFLOPS of compute power. While not directly comparable in GPU count, Googles infrastructure is among the most powerful for AI workloads. 5. Amazon Web Services AWS Compute Power Offers extensive GPU instances internal AI compute resources are not publicly disclosed Overview AWS provides a wide range of GPUbased instances for customers but does not reveal specifics about its own AI compute capacity. 6.

I find it creepy and weird. Plus, hes at how many kids now? He doesnt just talk, he does his part, and I think its more than just donating sperm though thats so far just my conspiracy theory. Whats the motive? Why does the richest man in the world need more people? Maybe its to outgrow the planet and need to expand to the solar system, or to have more customers, could be innocent positive motive, but it could be much worse such as war, an army of his own making him more powerful than governments. Hes pretty big on mind manipulation these days and he needs young brains to mold. Why do you ask me, it doesnt matter what I think?! I replied to the question asked first... What do you think?

Please note that I didnt call him Hitler, I wrote that the repeated talk point reminded me of Hitler, which is just one of the many actions that guy did. Elon is Elon, but when he talks about birth replacement he creeps me out and reminds me of Hitler. Please also note that in another comment on this post I wrote I would buy a model Y or X. What is the big deal about birth replacement? So, lets say Earth population drops to 5B and stays there is that really bad? I think its fair to say many people still want to have kids and population will not go to zero, so it will find an equilibrium. Earth has been at 5B before, even much less. Sure, some pension systems might collapse. But isnt a natural equilibrium better, i.e. a worthier goal than whatever it is were achieving by propping up birth replacement? Birth replacement for birth replacements sake?"

Jobys valuation is a lot bigger than Archer, possibly more than it should be, but Joby is pretty significantly superior in terms of vehicle and this is a long term play. Not only is Joby a lot quieter, which is incredibly important for urban transport, but they have a different business model. They want to operate the vehicles themself as a ride share service while Archer in the short term at least plans to sell the vehicles to get some cash flow. Long term the Joby model is far more lucrative. Honestly I think Archer will get into the same business model once theyve sold some vehicles and find themselves in a better financial situation, but with a long term play like this Id rather have the overvalued top layer than the undervalued second place. Tbh, I want both which is why I split my investment between the two."

They basically doubled in the last week due to chips funding, but they need to execute. Execution primarily involves filling more orders and reducing CapEx, which they seem set up fairly well to do based on recent transcripts Ive readlistened to. They will have slightly higher manufacturing capabilities at the Mohawk Valley fab than they initially predicted. Overall, I like WOLF because they are the most experienced when it comes to making wafers of size. They are currently transitioning their wafer production from 150 to 200 mm, which is a great sign. On a more qualitative note, when I watch their YouTube podcasts, I feel that they get into the depths of the technology which I appreciate because to me, it shows that the scientists and engineers are leading the company. Other companies will for sure offer SiC in the future, but will they have the highest market share, Im not sure. WOLF is primarily focused on making the wafers, while sum companies focus on wafer production and device development. Only time will tell of course, my recommendation is to look into the tech and prepare for a moderately bumpy ride. After two years I project itll double and be around 3035."

Their last report shows 64M in cash. So they blew through about 3.75B in cash in three years. Their TTM revenue was 670M and their resulting gross profit was an impressively bad 546M. Throw in the all the other expenses of running a business SGA, RD, etc... and they managed to lose 1.5B. Their cash from operations not capex or anything else was 900M. If they try to raise 1B now with their stock around 2, shareholders are gonna get proper fd. and probably the next year, and the next. Or I guess they could load up on long term debt at these interest rates. How exactly can they continue to fund this shitshow of an operation without bottoming out shareholders?"

Its my biggest holding. imo theyre trading at a very attractive valuation based on their uranium business alone. the rare earths business will make them a significant player on that front in line with MP materials and lynas while offering the added benefits of additional uranium supply from the rare earth mines at practically no additional cost and qualifying them for potential rare earths related US govt funding as they try to reshore their rare earths supply chain. lots of investing options to play the uranium thesis but UUUU is pretty unique in its combination of current and proven production capacity, ownership if a uranium mill, US based company and production and diversified ventures. Theres lots of companies talking big talk about future productions but the sector is plagued with delays and production forecast revisions. Its not easy to produce uranium and energy fuels has proven they can do it and are currently doing it. the fact that they currently produce and are ramping up production also offers them way more torque to rising uranium prices as they occur rather than betting on market conditions remaining as favorable for an entire decade.

Recently after this past summers stock I bought a big block of shares at 4.90. I honestly have not been able to get my head around the fact that analysts arent upgrading the stock based on a TON of different revenue streams this company will have access too. In fact one analyst downgraded the stock from MKM Roth who i might add doesnt have a great track record imo. What am I missing ?? What are analysts missing ? A lot of it iI believe is they are sworn to secrecy with DOE DOD and various other agencies as well as other countries they deal with. They cant inform until they announce earnings and even then there are no specific details given. I believe in CEO Mark Chalmers. Hes implemented the plan and theyre in the process to initiate plan. Hes making it happen with a lot of smart people they have acquired from recently acquired companies as well. In this respect he can continue to monitor uranium which he has multiple decades of experience and delegate other duties to people more qualified then him for REEs and medical isotopes divisions.

They appear to be pursuing magnet making once the mill upgrades complete which will be very exciting, especially as a trade war with China likely continues to heat up.

I do see that hasnt been updated on many brokers though despite UUUU already having completed the necessary SEC filings. Hope that gets fixed soon. This should be as a result of the share conversion and monetary dividend given to base resource stockholders in order to acquire base resources. In February 2020 the share count was 114milliom shares right before covid hit further driving the stock down in already bear market conditions. The shares outstanding from December 2020 to July 2024 prior to the completed disclosure of the base resource shares dilution acquisition the stock went from 131 mill shares to 163mill shares. A dilution of 30 million shares over 3.5 years or about 10 million shares a year. However the majority of those shares were sold during 2021 with minimal share dilution after November 2021. For the next 3.5 after that there was a dilution of 1.5 per year equaling about 7 million shares added to the float. Im using December 2020 as that is the period of time when the stock came out of a bear market and began the current overall bull market rally. Sales of shares from prior to then I consider to be during the Uranium bear market conditions of which dilution was done for the company to survive. Edit for comparison UEC has nearly doubled their float from November 21 to today."

It will take a long time to turn that behemoth of a company around, but investing in its people with knowledge and capability and letting those people work their way up into positions to continually deliver a superior product is a great start. This includes machinists and engineers. Outsourcing to the lowest bidder is not helping at all. Bring back the quality manufacturing of its parts back under its own company. Of course this all takes time, and detracts from quarter over quarter growth, which wall street despises. Boeing helped win a world war and delivered some of the greatest aircraft in the world, both civilian and military. It helped win the space race. This isnt a bullshit tech company with a smoke and mirror product trading at insane PE levels with no substance under it no offense to you tech people. Im dying to invest in BA at such a low price, but until they can start to prove they are on board with making a superior aircraft, I cant bring myself to buy their stock or touch an option.

And it currently does not deliver. And call me Captain obvious, but Boeing currently is at junk status. The only reason its not labelled that, is apprently, that the rating agencies want to protect it from the fallout as long as possible. I had expected a prolongued decline of Boeing, but looking at the numbers, there is a chance, well see it crash and burn instead. I expect, the moment when Boeing actually tries to get fresh cash will be, when the rating agencies pull the plug. If they dont simply decide to do their work properly before. The last time they acted so clearly against the real assessment was probably in the banking crisis, when they labelled trash as AAA. Boeing in comparison to Airbus as alternative investment is still massively overpriced. And I may be just an amateur, but once they loose that ridiculous rating, institutional investors will be forced to pull out, due to the restraints in what they are allowed to invest.

However, removing then replacing the door would have mandated a costly reinspect. So the plane was sent back to get the door bolts replaced multiple times, but each time nothing happened as it would have required replacing the door and that was deemed too expensive because of the mandated inspection. Eventually the door bolts were replaced, and that was documented, even though the door had never been removed. How were the bolts replaced without removing the door? Nobody knows, its impossible. But somehow, thats what the paperwork says happened. So when the final check occurred to make sure things were done correctly, nobody checked to make sure all the door bolts were in place as they had been checked in the last inspection and since the door hadnt been removed they obviously couldnt have changed.

I like high stock prices Im invested in quite a few and want to see my money grow. But at the same time, the destruction of a company in the name of short term growth is simply unsustainable.

I have worked for all the biggest aircraft companies in the world, including Lockheed, Boeing and Airbus and at least 8 others. I have written class 1 software, DO178C DAL A, and achieved certification for that software on those aircraft. Additionally I have designed complete avionic suites inculding all sensors, integration and testing DO254. I have also been a developer for ILS and GPS systems. As a contract consultant I am totally capitalist, however even I know the importance of an experienced loyal workforce. I know the steps that have to have happened to fuck up that badly. The Flight Control Systems FCS are safety critical. They are class 1, DO178C DAL A. Nothing should interfere with their operation. Yet MCAS was allowed to overwrite the FCS. When you design a Safety critical system you use multiple types of sensors from multiple locations as input. MCAS used 1 sensor in 1 location and used this to overwrite outputs from the FCS. The amount of lies and fake documents produced to get that through the certification bodies is a lot! The whole reason for Boeing doing this is because the Airbus 320 family were using engines that were 20 more efficient. That is a big saving on the operating costs and customers liked that. Boeing had to change their engines to compete. They added larger engines which changed the position of the 737 centre of gravity. When this happened the Flight Control System FCS software should have been rewritten and retested. This would have cause around 12 months delay and around 20 million. Instead they came up with MCAS. That is inherently unsafe as it it one sensor in one location. They also never told the pilots about it as that would have meant retraining. They have now provided retraining however MCAS is still unsafe! The correct solution would be to change the FCS software. Yes I am totally serious. Each of the CEOs Muilenburg onward are no different from each other. The only hope is a 180 degree shift in position and I dont think that will happen. My prediction is that Boeing are in the shit. They will be split up and those parts sold of. Defence is worth having, someone like Lockheed or Airbus will take over commercial and space will be dumped. There will be other bits too. Most buyers will be unwilling but will be forced to take them. Current shareholders will take a bath! Good luck in your investments."

I dont argue that theres plenty of unskilled labor jobs in all manufacturing settings, but if youre building an airplane, its not a matter of repeatedly hitting 4 lug nuts with a torque limited impact gun on an assembly line. You have to be able to read electrical, hydraulic, etc schematics and apply that information. You have to be able to reliable make precision measurements. You have to be able to read prints. You have to have to technical capabilities of reliably assembling one of the most complex pieces of equipment on the planet from a set of plans and turn that into a safe reality with a service life of 20 years or better. Engineering is a skill, and so is finance. But dont downplay the complex manufacturing process as unskilled, easily replaceable labor. Thats probably why fucking doorplugs are coming out. In my opinion, that attitude in general is truthfully what is destroying long term growth of manufacturing companies as their products become less and less reliable yet more complex as time goes on. this isnt exclusive to BA.

It doesnt make to much of a difference in my opinion, since the milestones would still have to be achieved, if I understand you corectly? So no work on a plane no money from customers? My focus here is on this piece of information Boeing burned through nearly 4 billion in cash in the first quarter and West said that figure could be similar or possibly a little worse in the second quarter, but that the company would likely return to generating cash in the second half of 2024. Boeing had 10 billion dollar in cash after the second quarter and after taking up 10 billion Dollar in credit. I guess, we can safely assume, that their expectation of returning to generate cash in the second half of the year has evaporated with the strike. Meaning they are currently burning through that cash at a rate, which would see them illiquid possibly in December? They say, they have another 10 billion Dollar of lifeline, but by then their ratings may have significantly changed and they would also be at the very end of the line. The bottom line in my opinion is Boeing needs this strike to end. And it needs to do so fast. If it wants to have any hope for a recovery, it needs those workers on its side."

They have investment from Amazon and VW, as well as a shit ton of cash on hand already. The real bear case against Rivian is that its a car company. This is not Tesla 2.0, because the market values Tesla based on this speculative dream that Teslas robotaxis will take everyone everywhere, and Teslas robots will replace all manual labor, and Tesla will be worth 10T. No one is buying Tesla because they think their car business is so amazing that its worth 50x earnings or whatever it is. I think Rivian is a pretty easy double over the next couple of years, but do not expect it to have a Tesla like run. Its just not gonna happen."

                    "text": "I just posted a full explanation, but it got removed. Again Source The Economist The longedfor moment is almost here. For two and a half years, ever since Americas Federal Reserve embarked on its fastest series of interestrate rises since the 1980s, investors have been desperate for any hint of when it would reverse course. Now it would be a huge surprise if Jerome Powell, the central banks chair, did not announce the first such reduction after its ratesetting committee meets on September 18th. Indeed, among traders, the debate is no longer whether but how much. Market pricing implies roughly a 40 chance that officials will cut their policy rate, currently between 5.25 and 5.5, by 0.25 percentage points, and a 60 chance that they will instead opt for 0.5.Going by how investors have reacted to Mr Powells pronouncements over the past couple of years, you might think this is unadulterated good news for them. After all, Americas stockmarket has spent much of that time cratering whenever it looked like interest rates would stay higher for longer, and soaring on any suggestion that borrowing costs might soon come down. But it is not for nothing that buy the rumour, sell the fact is such an enduring mantra in financial markets. For all that the prospect of rate cuts sets investors pulses racing, their actual arrival has often proved disappointing.Consider how share prices have responded to past loosening cycles. Although the three episodes in the 1990s, when Alan Greenspan was at the Feds helm, did give the stockmarket successive boosts, this centurys record has been drearier. Rate cuts in the early 2000s took place during the bursting of the dotcom bubble those starting in 2007 coincided with the market crash that accompanied the global financial crisis. The doveish turn that began in 2019 buoyed share prices at first, but the effect was then swamped by the onset of the covid19 pandemic. Like so much in finance, rate cuts have a small effect on share prices in this case a positive one that is easily obscured by other factors. The fillip comes from a reduction in borrowing costs, which allows companies to keep more of their profits and encourages customers to spend more on their products. If bond yields also fall, prospective returns on shares become that much more attractive by comparison, providing another boost.What, then, might be the swamping factors this time? One is perennial that money never gets cheaper in isolation, but because central bankers fear economic weakness and want to stave it off. Just now, that seems like less of a worry than normally is the case. True, Americas labour market has cooled, which prompted a brief growth scare among shareholders over the summer. However, unusually for the end of a tightening cycle, the economy appears to be merely slowing down rather than entering a recession. Company profits should therefore be safer than usual as the Fed begins to cutand so should share prices.More worrying are the infamous long and variable lags, as named by Milton Friedman, between changes in monetary policy and their impact on companies and consumers. Counterintuitively, even as the Fed prepares to loosen, many borrowers will face steeper interest bills. Any firm that issued fixedrate debt while money was nearly free, which is plenty of them, will eventually need to refinance. Since there is little prospect of the Fed returning interest rates close to zero any time soon, debtservicing costs for such firms will be rising for some time yet. Homeowners on fixedrate mortgages who need to refinance after moving house, for instance will be in a similar position. So rate cuts may energise the economy, and hence the stockmarket, less today than they would have done in the past.The biggest hint that the Feds largesse will disappoint investors, though, is the extent to which it is already expected by the market. Already, traders central expectation is for 1.25 percentage points worth of cuts before the year is out, followed by another 1.25 next year. Such rapid moves have only occurred in the past amid recessions or crises. There is plenty of room, in other words, for Mr Powell to surprise on the hawkish side even as he slashes rates, which would raise bond yields and make stocks less attractive. Rate cuts ought to be good for the stockmarket. But not if investors have already pocketed their benefits. To get around the wall, install as an extension."

Youre talking about another order of magnitude of both capital and information. What return on investment will this bring, especially when LLMs and generative AI will not be general AI general intelligence would take models that actually use logic? 2. Investors are looking for secondary, tertiary, etc plays on AI and data centers. Energy, infrastructure, materials. 1. Well see. Nvidia has done amazing things but every single semi company makes these claims about their newest chip. 1 and 2 are solid reasons, fundamentally there should be money continually flowing to Nvidia.

Sir, why do you think the latest model improvements are important? Sir because they are demonstrating what is possible and this is only the beginning. You will see models get better and better very quickly. And you will start to understand that LLMs and all the online AI is just practice for physical robots.

Joby owns whole tech stack. Has hydrogen tech, FULL autonomous tech, Uber ElevateOS software ready n tested. They are WAY AHEAD of everyone else.

That or you just read the grizzly report and believed it I dunno. Bad Product...1000lbs heavier than Joby Its true midnight is heavier, but Id need more information to understand why this would strictly rule out competition with Joby. The Midnight airframe is very specifically targeted at slightly shorter operational routes and urban air taxi service compared to Jobys design. Additional weight could be for stability, passenger features, or the use of cheaper OEM parts instead of custom design. They have not demonstrated full flight. the video here pretty conclusively demonstrates a full size Midnight airframe flying. I would like more information about, specifically, the Flight Data Im aware Joby published data about noise in conjunction with NASA, but Im not sure if thats specifically what youre referencing here? Additionally, USAF took delivery of a functional full size Midnight airframe I am assuming that they would not take on a full size vaporware. Founders are business leaders vs technocrats Gonna be honest here, my entire OP is about why this isnt a bad thing, more on this in the next point. using too many vendors and integrating them is a huge problem. This is how the entire aerospace industry works, not a huge problem. Archer is able to source from so many companies because those companies exist as suppliers to aerospace companies already. this article covers the divergent strategies between ACHR and JOBY in depth Of note But when it comes to their specific manufacturing strategies, the two companies have staked out sharply different paths Joby is vertically integrated and largely develops its components and systems inhouse, while Archer is pursuing a more traditional model by relying on a roster of Tier 1 legacy aerospace suppliers. The article goes on to quote Adam Goldstein specifically saying that they are aware that an IKEA aircraft as you call it is an 80 solution but provides a significantly superior market entry point. Uber Elevates engineer is even quoted as speculating that Joby will eventually divest from its full vertical integration. nbsp Again, this point and both ACHRs quotes and the note that no aerospace company comes close to the level of vertical integration Joby is pursuing is exactly what my post is about ACHRs path to revenue is WAY more clean than Jobys Stellantis investment is all shares I cover this in my OP. ACHR has far fewer outstanding shares than Joby even after considering a 400m issuance to Stellantis through 2030. Their plant is going to stay idle for a long time Why? Even if theyre not fully certified when the plant becomes operational, ramping up will take time and they have a global orderbook including shipping to international customers which may have different certification timelines or requirements. Keep issuing more ESOPs and founder has left Admittedly, I dont know how significant potential dilution from this is, but usually, ESOPs arent so massive as to completely shift the dynamic of investing outcomes. The founder left to start new companies after having a fallingout with the board, yes, but he hasnt ever publicly trashed the company or even corroborated claims of it being a PR Scam so maybe he just didnt like it and went to do something else."

I do think, if youre patient, simply buying the 2026 options will be wildly profitable. Per my thesis in this post, I do think Archer is currently undervalued by a significant margin. By October, ACHR should announce entry into and timeline for For Credit airframe type certification, and confirmed that their georgia plant remains on schedule. I admit October is aggressive, but I have seen significant hype spikes in the sector before. I may need to reload in October for more January 25... According to currently known timelines, we should know by January whether ACHR and JOBY will really start operations during 2025. Once they have confirmed type certification by EOY and rolled even one airframe off their main assembly line, there will be major investor FOMO. nbsp By EOY 2025, or whenever actual first revenue generating sales or flights take place, we will see ASTSlike price movements."

ACHRs cap is about 1.26bn, of which about 450m is cashshort term assets. This leaves about 2.7bn and .8bn in speculative, long term, and IP patent, tech value respectively. nbsp Joby has fully acquired i.e. owns the IP H2Fly Hydrogen powertrain, Xwing autonomous flight, and Uber Elevate ElevateOS for ride ordering. Moreover, Joby has customdesigned nearly their entire airframe. When combined with speculative valuation from successfully entering operations, this value seems fairly reasonable. Even in a bear case, Joby potentially has multiple outlets to offer itself for acquisition or pivot to another method e.g. conversion of existing planes to hydrogen and autonomous flight. nbsp Given the IP disparity Archer designs its own battery packs and some other components, along with the actual airframe of course, my thesis is that Jobys IP and slight schedule lead are now diminishing in relative value compared to Archers actual business plan. Jobys IP stack is cool, but certifying custom build, and operational scaling are going to be harder than for Archer... With certification and operations set to begin next year, Archers superior orderbook and market plans should be valued equivalently to Jobys IP lead at this time. nbsp TLDR Joby fair value for their IP stack and superior product ACHRs superior market entry plan and order book should be worth more now, as risk of complete failure diminishes and likelihood of going to market increases."

                    "text": "Yeah Ive seen this and the only substantive issue, especially in the year since this report was published, may be the facility monitoring, Ill get back to that piece in a bit. Overall, and ironic considering their claims of ACHR being misleading, I find the report to be pretty deliberately misleading itself. Top line, Archer has clearly built and flown at least several completely functional Midnight airframes since that report. Regarding the USAF contract Archer has since delivered a fully functional Midnight airframe to the Air Force. Its true that they are behind Joby, but thats always been the case, and I am assuming neither the FAA Special Airworthiness Cert nor the USAF would take delivery of a scam product or vaporware at least, not a full airframe. The USAF potential order for airframes is not a substantial piece of ACHRs overall order book or operating revenue plans in any case, but I dont see why they wouldnt be able to deliver on the relatively small order if USAF continues to pursue it. They mention ACHR contracts with USAF related to autonomous flight and other highertech initiatives. I do find it likely ACHR will not continue as a leader in that space, as Jobys technology in these areas is indeed superior, as I mention in my OP. These contracts are a fraction 30M or less of the main eVTOL initiative there in any case. Highlighting these as potential losses is misleading in the context of ACHRs main business. Grizzly consistently mentions the dollar value of exercised warrants and share awards in the context of the obviouslyinflated price of August 23. While yes, those shares may be worth a considerable amount if ACHR succeeds in going to market, Grizzly leads with very large numbers attached to those share issuances while barely mentioning how unusual a price above 7 is for ACHR. Also as I addressed in OP, Grizzly talks up Joby throughout, but Jobys total share dilution is over double ACHRs total outstanding shares to this day. While there may be valid complaints about dilution, its outrageous to be in up arms over the issuances when a key competitor has done so much more. They obliquely imply that the companies investing in ACHR are doing so because theyre being given an opportunity to sell out of the company at the inflated share price. Stellantis has since continued to agree to investments in the company, with direct sharesforwork programs to ramp manufacturing. This is a pretty clear rebuttal of a number of points made by Grizzly. nbsp Regarding the manufacturing, flight videos, and overall progress being clouded ACHR has ramped up PR and specific posting of facilities and progress on the Georgia plant. Midnight clearly exists and clearly flies, including a more recent 10 minute unedited flight test video, an exact rebuttal of one of Grizzlys issues Where they posted a similar uncut Joby video. Its also a little odd that Grizzly was complaining about editing to make a flight appear longer in a video that was already only 042 seconds, which... okay? The source who claimed 2028 was Optimistic for certification is clearly not tracking how overall sector is making progress. If thats the case, Joby would be on target for 2027 at best also, and they have a complete custom ecosystem to certify, not just offtheshelf parts. Both companies, in the year following, are maintaining target times and presenting percenttocompletion that still targets 2025. It is possible still that Archers certification will be delayed to late 25 or 2026... I do find it worrying that they are still a little handwavey about their completely compliant for credit airframes being ready to go or in testing. I have addressed schedule risks several times when posting about the sector and ACHR specifically. That said, since August 23, their main Georgia plant is clearly progressing and they maintain the EOY timeline for completion as of this quarter. nbsp The claims about doing on site observation of the airport are at least interesting. However, its notable that the week they spent observing was exactly when the full size Midnight was built but not yet FAA certified. This timeframe lines up with the archer engineer saying they would have to wait as I find it rather plausible flight tests were paused between completion of the Midnight full size prototype and its airworthiness certification note that the continue to test flight daily were from prior announcements that occurred before their observational period I also have very little faith in the reports of supposed eyewitnesses when they are being asked about things by a literally activist shortseller company... Maker and Midnight are both quiet and small airframes, unique looking, true, but also short range. A full test flight could occur over the space of an hour or less, so even daily test flights may be missed routinely by people simply on the same airport grounds. Note that Grizzly did not consult or reference FAA Air Traffic Control, flight plan logs, or other possible authoritative sources for air time. Moreover, the empty facility they visited is very definitely online given that actual photo and video from the manufacturing process has been posted, and, again, at least several operational midnight airframes exist including one that USAF deemed acceptable for delivery. nbsp TO BE CLEAR I am not saying ACHR is definitely a superstar company thats going to be shitting out eVTOLs into the air taxi market next year... I just dont think that the piece published by Grizzly is a reasonable analysis."

                    "text": "First of all, if youre holding shares, you should be fine over a longer time horizon, this is around where we should bottom out... why ACHR is valued how it is right now Archer and JOBY, and all other eVTOL companies except EHang in china, are prerevenue companies. In other words, theyre spending money on RD but havent yet begun operations. Archer isnt actually selling or flying airframes commercially yet. As a result, traditional valuations such as PE, Dividend return, DCF, and other methods are either difficult or impossible to apply as a valuation mechanic. financial information such as cash burn rate compare to likely start of revenue generation substitute for this as a risk indicator. It does have generally nonbinding commitments for airframe sales valued at 6bn, as well as plans to selfoperate an air taxi service. Along with projected growth in the new Advanced Air Mobility sector, archer is theoretically well positioned for massive growth when operations do begin... Conversely, two major risks remain to getting operations. Most notably, type certification from the FAA saying the aircraft can fly passengers, and scaling of manufacturing supply chain and completion of main assembly line. Theres also a wider risk of a lack of infrastructure to support Air Taxis or the sector simply not catching on as something the public pays for. Essentially, the value of the company is then Possible major growth as a first mover in a new industry minus risk of catastrophic failure. Investing long term is saying Im parking money here knowing im speculating on success while short selling is saying i think the risks here are too great, and this company will fail before reaching operations. Why, specifically, its current exact value? Well, per my post, i have no idea and think its undervalued, so i am invested, but other people clearly have assessed the risk profile differently. nbsp As to why its red or green on any given day... its generally red and low priced when no catalysts or news comes out... Archer is very much on the hook to be much more concrete about its schedule, and soon, or the perceived risks grow a lot... many people are probably getting scared off by the relative lack of news given the supposedly tight timeline to start production. it goes WAY green when catalysts hit... new deals, timelines being confirmed, advances in certification progress, etc... that is, when the likelihood of future revenues increase and risks decrease and investors pile in. nbsp EOY prediction... Given the above and the fact that i am heavily invested in Oct and Jan calls. whatll happen? Basically two possible routes 1. ACHR begins for credit FAA type certification flights and proceeds quickly due to having mostly off the shelf parts i cover this vs Jobys custom build in my OP, and completes its Georgia manufacturing plant. If both of these occur by EOY, we probably go back to near 52w high 7 if not higher. 2. Any delays, setbacks, or major negative news occurs, or radio silence continues, and price continues to tank as investors look for shorter term gains and are unwilling to keep money parked in ACHR while it struggles to get running. nbsp Past EOY 24 to EOY 25 If they succeed in an entry in service date by EOY 25, that is, commercial operations begin, then we get to see an ASTSlike move in the price, as retail and institutions surge in on the hype train. This may be dampened a bit if Joby enters service earlier especially if Joby begins operations and encounters problems with operations We may see pops much earlier in 25 if nonbinding order agreements become binding as a result of Certification. 6bn in confirmed order backlog would be MASSIVE compared to 6bn in uncommitted orders. Conversely, if for credit testing begins but they faildelay for some reason, price tanks back to 3 range. If manufacturing plant has delays or failures, or production stalls due to supply chain issues, commensurate reduction in share price. nbsp Overall if you have shares you have several strategies Very long hold, as the Bull case through 2030 implies explosive potential 10x or more in share price, more if we get meme price spikes Sell on hype taking profits next time really good news comes out... then either be happy with that or rebuy when price slips between good news announcements. nbsp why do i have shorter term options? Well i have shares too, the short term options I play are very much gambling... but, as i describe above, this very speculative tech sector can see impressively insane hype spikes. Great news about beginning for credit testing or new orders or firm commitments, all trigger runs past 5 to 67. The time between now and EOY 24 is absolutely critical for the stated timeline and therefore speculative options could pay out massively. If price spikes, i also take out Strangles add puts to the mix to account for bad news and price drops."

And i maintain that ACHRs potential revenue streams and overall risk profile justify a valuation similar to Jobys minus Jobys cash advantage value nbsp I suppose if you assume all revenue generation will be pushed to 2026 or later, ACHRs cash position is more concerning, but because total shares are so much lower, the dollar for dollar dilution of long run profits 2030 or even 2040 for shares if achr does another funding round is still unlikely to be a major factor... additionally, ACHR may be able to sell airframes overseas to committed customers who are able to certify in their own jurisdictions especially Saudi ArabiaUAE, and both companies are likely to be able to operate overseas nbsp Still, absolutely, this is a speculative industry... but look at ASTSRKLB for example, very similar trajectory and similar background of prerevenue speculative tech that finally went live.

Patents Assigned to NAVITAS SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED Justia Patents Search tldr I cant verbally demonstrate to you if NVTS has a leg up on the competition because I dont have the expertise in the engineering. The reason why I am invested in this company is that with AI data centers requiring a significant amount of power in comparison to traditional data centers, GaNSiC technology may be the preferred tech when it comes to power efficiency. I believe over time the usage of GaNSiC technology will take off as the global world requires more efficient power usage. per this article they have 250 patents issued or pending Navitas Celebrates Ten Years of Electrifying NextGen Power Innovations Navitas navitassemi.com"

Weve been on electronic records long enough that the physical storage of adult records has generally timed out. Pediatric records have to be retained for 7 years past age of majority.

Its like paying their electric bill. Just something they do without second thought. Id imagine those revenues are probably not going anywhere. At least not all at once or fast. Similar to what others have mentioned. The debttoequity ratio is insane. Are you looking for something like rate cuts to be the catalyst for this?

Yes but with their dividend at 2.64 it they raise the dividend to bring that up a point to over 3.5 which I think is the expectation baked into that price.

On the tax return you usually start with net income and then add or deduct various adjustments to convert the financial statement IFRS US GAAP net income to USA taxable income.

So keeping net income low means that they can retain more capital to use to expand their assets without relying as much on debt. The metric generally used to track REIT performance and ability to pay dividends is Funds from operationsFFO. This is essentially cash flow after paying for all overhead expensesupkeep, interest, etc. Iron Mountains FFO is 4.12 per year.

A couple of years later, he moved to a different division, but that was fine because the project was complete, so there were only occasional phone calls about it. That was 3 years ago, and now the office lease ran out and its time to move. There are 2 file cabinets and 7 boxes of drawings and paperwork. Absolutely nobody remaining at the firm understands the project at all. There is no project number to bill time to. Anyone who could research and understand the project is busy, and has measurable performance targets for billability. So, either you give the responsibility to the college intern, Skyler who happens to be the CFOs nephew and doesnt really want this kind of job anyway ... or you cram all the papers into 12 boxes and ship them off to Iron Mountain with an order to destroy in 10 years. ...

On a similar topic, I have a similar feeling about copper. Although I have yet to put as much elbow grease on the topic as you did on uranium, I get the impression that as we move to a more electrified future, a few extra stretches of copper wire are going to be needed, even regardless of the energy source.

Oil products have completely consumed the global market. This doesnt take much away from nuclear.. just that uranium isnt as versatile as oil. Until we learn how to secondarily use depleted Uranium besides using it to fucking blast the planetkill people arguably the most profitable thing but I digress I dont think it will reach the prestigepower of oil think of plastics, gas, rubber, roads, etc. I think thats what really limits the potential of uranium, the fact that we have to store it I believe theres now safe depleted uraniums but I forget the names. Either way its almost useless What Im saying is, we need a more vitaldynamic use for uranium daily besides energy. For now its just a fancy coal. I hope to see a future where we have totally stable nuclear and have nuclear powered things that can quantum compute things our mind cant even comprehend. Big oil would probably shoot that down anyways though. Rather profit off our lack of societal progression.

One reason is that investment demand is strong, and will increase for midterm after cuts. Another is that the US fared better than most other countries since Covid.

And consumers may be stressed I think issue of CoL will eventually cause some type of mean reversion in assets and wages, but the Fed can easily boost again.

Assuming they have no other way, Id expect US to push Ukraine to make amends with Russia. I assume Ukraine would have to pay all the money back to US? 2 Regarding consumer consumption, Ive read a few articles in the past about economic depressions and stock market crashes when people can only afford to spend on necessities tightening of wallet as you aptly said, they also spend on minor luxuries like women spending on lipsticks hence lipstick sales rose. 3 Real estate has been bloated for a while especially in Canada and other important cities around the globe so Im expecting global correction in real estate. Case in point, China and more recently Sweden have faced real estate crashes. 4 Several countries in EU are in recession or are inching towards it. Germany, Sweden, France and UK. UK also has a PS10bn deficit Rachel Reeves tried to raise taxes to get it. 5 Iran Israel conflict heating up. US could lend a hand there resulting in even more spending. 6 Consumer spending will be reduced due to inflation and unemployment. Tiktokers making videos on how expensive grocery bills have become.

I like that you pointed out the possible influence of the wealth effect, because it honestly wasnt at ny radar. Id still argue, that increased spendings isnt mainly driven by savings, but by the 56 increase of income in the US. This is mainly driven by the inflation and generally spend more if they earn more. The Valuation of stocks is not per se in the overvalued area.I do believe that we had a rare situation where a lot of ppl investing passively in ETFs, but most of the index is driven by the mag 7. So most liquidity was flowing into the mag 7 leading to an overvaluation of the head of the index. There are tons of fairly or undervalued companies and this pushback hit mostly the mag 7 and doing collateral dmg on the whole market. I think the market is in a healthier state than 1 or 2 weeks ago, because mag 7 all lost like 1020, while the rest of the market lost less. Even though itn not perfectly balanced Tesla, Nvidia its in a much healthier state now. Lower consumer spending results in lower earnings across the board and it results in higher unemployment. Speaking of unemployment, we all know it has been rising moderately, but is still at relatively low levels by historical comparison at least based on the BLS definition and formula the validity of the formula is quite questionable today, but it at least represents a relatively applestoapples comparison. As asset prices decline and the negative wealth effect kicks in and consumer spending declines, unemployment will increase. As unemployment increases, this will cause consumer spending to decline further exacerbating the problem and the cycle continues... This pretty much is the definition of a recession. Macroeconomics teaches, that by doing an expansive fiscal policy, you can stimulate demand by expenses of the state and effectively balance this negaative effect of a recession partly out. We should be happy, that we have relatively high interest rates compared to 5 to 10 years ago, because it gives the opportunity to work with it. If we would be in this situation with no interest rate, that would be scary. Times are rough these days, especially on a global political view and we might get a recession, but I doubt atm, that this will be the next 2008 crisis."

Employment Dynamics High levels of employment are maintained by various sectors of the economy beyond just consumerdriven ones. Government and infrastructure projects, healthcare, and technology sectors often continue to hire and grow even during downturns. Government Spending Capacity Despite high current spending levels, governments can still leverage other tools like targeted fiscal policies, public investment in infrastructure, and tax incentives to stimulate economic activity without exacerbating deficits drastically. Federal Reserve Tools The Fed has multiple mechanisms beyond lowering interest rates, such as quantitative easing, forward guidance, and lending facilities to support economic stability and growth. Inflation Control The risk of significant inflation remains mitigated by the Feds capacity to adjust monetary policy quickly if inflationary pressures rise, thus maintaining a balanced economic environment. Asset Market Diversification While some asset classes may decline, others like bonds, safehaven currencies, and sectors like utilities or consumer staples typically perform well in downturns, providing balance and resilience to investors. Economic Cycles Economic downturns and recoveries are natural parts of the business cycle. Current policies and safety nets are designed to cushion impacts and promote quicker recoveries, reducing longterm adverse effects."

If the problem is overheating from connecting two Blackwells side by side, spacing them out or whatever solution they find, is more like a band aid solution as opposed to a fundamentally superior approach. Re point 4, selling 1 Blackwell GPU 1 CPU is not accelerated computing. The main product was 2 Blackwell GPUs 1 CPU, and lots of those in a rack. The performance of 1 GPU 1CPU wouldnt be competitive. No one would buy that. Also re point 4, it seems now almost certain that TSMC leaked it. They cant afford to have idle fabs to that scale. If Blackwell was supposed to generate 90b per year, thats 22.5b per quarter. If you use TSMCs 50 gross margin model, thats 10b impact to TSMC. They will be scrambling for work hence the leak. This way, instead of calling the industry and saying we have spare capacity, the industry can call them. AMD would be high up on the list. Re point 5, apparently the gaming GPUs have also been delayed...looks more structural than a 2 week fix. There is a point 6. If you apply a negative lens for a moment, and assume Blackwell starts shipping in Q1, and Blackwell Ultra needs to be fundamentally redesigned, it will mean that AMD from a hardware POV will launch products before Nvidia and again from a hardware POV they will be superior by a margin. Of course, CUDA is important, but reputationally and brandwise, Nvidia takes a hit. Also, CUDAs edge is that it enables Nvidia GPUs to perform amazingly. But what if someone elses hardware is noticeably superior? Doesnt that also weaken one aspect of the whole point of CUDA?"
