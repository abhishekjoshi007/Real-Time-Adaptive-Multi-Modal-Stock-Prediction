Good pop.\n\nJust eases back in at 10k shares. All things look to be a similar performance. So I&#39;ll be at 35k week before next earnings. \n\nFast 100k until it starts to really move toward it&#39;s potential of 31 in 25/6.\n\nGood luck.\n\nBut my MELI (350 shares) and GOOGLE (4990 shares) barbells keep things pretty even.\n\nMy best bet is a 1.4 million net upside within 10 years.\n\n\nBut STNE is not a hang on a forget it stock.

While I agree to some degree with him (I do want to see sales spending go down), I think he misunderstands the business. He always talks about &#34;revenue growth&#34; but that is not the way to analyze Stone. Let me explain why.Take oil refiners for example. They convert crude into gas. When oil prices dip by 20% and gas prices dip by 15%, their &#34;revenues&#34; dip by 15%. But costs dip by 20%! So, they look at &#34;crack spreads&#34;. That is, per barrel, what is the $ you gain by processing crude and selling it for gas. This is how &#34;efficiency&#34; is measured for refiners.Similar with Stone. Stone gets money at say 6% and lends for say 10%. When rates reduce, they lend at 9%. This reduces apparent revenue. But, costs decrease by 2% and profit increases from 4% to 5%. The correct metric to look at for Stone is not &#34;revenue growth&#34; but &#34;net financial income&#34; growth.Excluding selling expenses, NFI is growing very healthy: For the last 4 Qs, this was 209% 131% 151% 117%.Excluding both Selling &amp; Admin expenses, growth rates are: 81%, 64%, 69%, 70%.This is a healthy business with demand from clients. Selling cost is spent today but payoff is over time. That&#39;s why they are spending on sales. But, I hope they maintain it at these levels and not increase further."

None of these concern me as STNE shareholder. I will be buying more if the dip persists.Firstly, note that PAGS is a more like a bank; it doesn&#39;t have software and it does a lot of online checkouts. Stone is mostly brick and mortar and that&#39;s a huge difference in terms of economics. Secondly, PAGS doesn&#39;t breakout a lot of information like Stone cleanly does. Thirdly, PAGS management seems to hide behind undisclosed numbers; I found a few today in PAGS earnings that irked me; Stone&#39;s mgmt usually answer questions to the point and Stone IR have always responded to me with real information.With that said, I think the reaction to PAGS is for the following:They increased revenue guidance but not income saying rates are higher than anticipatedThey mentioned take rates reduced in LMEC without breaking out real numbersHigh selling expenses; market thinks that they are not justifiedBasically, market now considers their LMEC growth of 50% to be suspect because it isn&#39;t profitable. It isn&#39;t because when you go to large customers you ain&#39;t got much margin and you ain&#39;t gonna make much online anyhow.Overall, I think there is no read through to Stoneco apart from maybe that everyone is increasing sales. Stone is an earnings story; not vibes. If they keep executing, EPS will follow and Stock price follows."

Partly expectation of Fed rate cuts &amp; partly hawkish rhetoric from BCBLikely next BCB president Galipolo made the right comments on inflation targetingStone&#39;s credit bookupto 750M in July from 711M reported for June. I think they&#39;ll reach yearend guidance of 800M by Q3. This is a 15-20% unlevered ROE business and quicker ramp is very meaningful for bottomline.Now, if Stone completes the sales buildout while macro remains conducive, cash generation will hockey stick up beyond  expectations and they&#39;ll likely even have to up the guidance. There&#39;s a reason mgmt bought all of that stock at 13.5$. I think even a couple of rate hikes won&#39;t have all that much effect because they can fund a lot from balance sheet. Additionally, they can quickly pass on the increased cost of funding.Cash generation is being understated due to the extremely high sales expenses. Mgmt says it&#39;s nothing to do with competition and everything to do with cross selling and upselling with revenues expected to increase from all this spending. If they are even partially correct, earnings will surprise +vely next two Qs."

Typically 1.5% of TPVGrowth rates in the above.TPV is growing at 24%Net MDR is stableNet Financial Income is growing 1% per year as overall engagment increasesSo, Stone&#39;s EPS increases approximately 24% + 1% + operating leverage.To understand Operating Leverage, suppose you had revenue of 100 and costs of 90, for a profit of 10. Next year, your revenue increases by 10 but costs only increase by 5 because you already have all the staff you need. Your profit now becomes 15. That is, revenue increased by 10% but profits increased 50%. This extra is called operating leverage. You get operating leverage once the business reaches scale. Like Amazon.Stone&#39;s results would be even better if they stop increasing selling expenses proportionately and let Operating leverage kick further.My model has 2025 eps at 1.63"

Then, later this month we get 2025 budget. My overall sense is that Brazil is in a very good place and is underappreciated.
