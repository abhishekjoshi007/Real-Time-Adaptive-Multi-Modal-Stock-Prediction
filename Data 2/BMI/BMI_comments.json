VKTX have data coming out soon that could put some nearterm pressure on ALT, TERN, etc. though, so leave some room to average down over the next week or two. Edit If anyone wants a neeky biotech play, buy SWTX before earnings. Street projecting low 50m revenue, have it on good authority theyll beat significantly. Ogsiveo is a blockbuster drug, EMA approval for Europe incoming any week now. Mirdametinib approval by February 28th 2025, another blockbuster. PT 60 by March 2025."

The fact that youre taking these dividends and just plowing them back into the original holdings is just a way to have less over time, since youre losing a portion of those dividends to taxes.

The larger the movement, the more of a chance to make money. This is known as volatility. Stocks that have recently had good days are likely to have more if you catch it soon enough. These are top daily performers. Cheap volatile stocks that have performed well recently, will give you a chance to buy a large amount of shares, so if they go up a dollar or so you make at least 300. Some of the stocks that performed well the day before will continue for two more days. Some will spike in the morning and drop off immediately. Some may even drop as soon as the market opens. Selling during the morning spike ensures you get small profits, but try to give it a little bit of time if you can to see if it looks like the day will keep trending upward. If it starts sinking as soon as you buy, get out ASAP. Unless you see the price rising more than sinking. After watching the market from the start of the day to the end a few times, itll be pretty obvious if its going to go your way or not. Youll see stocks going up past the morning spike tend to keep going up. Stocks going down at the beginning of the day tend to keep going down. I think its a safer strategy to bet on obvious trending movements rather than trying to think youll predict a reversal. Thats some peoples entire strategy. Im a gamer, Im just trying to farm easy cash within the rules of the game. It doesnt have to be sophisticated or pretty. Experiment with the simplest strategy you can find. Itll be nerve racking at first but if you really pay attention and learn from your mistakes, and your wins, you can end up winning more than you lose. There will most likely never be a day in which all the top performing stocks one day, tank the next day. Some of them will, but I notice that if I pick a few from that list and the first one doesnt work, usually the next choices do. Dont look for a stock that has just spiked for a second during the day. Find one that has a strong consistent upward trend throughout the day. Your instincts will be that youre buying too high. Like Tom Hougaard says, the market isnt a grocery store, youre not trying to find a bargain. Just because its more expensive today than it was yesterday doesnt mean your chance to capitalize on its performance is over."

It wasnt massive, but it was a real signal, and welltimed. China hasnt wanted to spend because their deficits have been bad enough with the revenue crunch from covid and such.

The biggest argument is a high yield savings account HYSA will out pace it in a year. I think thats a bit short sighted because their acting like interest rates will never move lower, but their point still stands, currently you would be better off letting it sit and accumulate interest than bag holding. We dont even have to guess at a timeframe or anything. Just take what you would put in intel and calculate your balance in a high yield savings account over the next 2 years by month. That is literally what you are aiming to beat minimum, otherwise its actually a loss for your risk and effort. If in the next 30 days you sell for a 10 pop, great, but the company literally told everyone expect nothing for a year, and even after that, who boy, just know we are working hard and will update then. The longer you hold, the higher that needs to be just to beat the HYSA. Back to the short sightedness of the HYSA . 1 they probably are not doing that, its just a floor they are using to compare what they are doing with their money ex not giving two craps about a 1 dividend and trying to beat it. Their being smart and not marrying the play, stock or HYSA, and we all should be doing that. If the HYSA is no good, dump it and move to the next channel thats best at that time. The difference between intel and HYSA is you can get out of the HYSA at anytime with 0 loss and invest elsewhere, while Intel may have lost value. They 100 dont make perfect plays, but its hard for them to watch others make dumb plays that cant even track interest rates without saying anything. Bottom line, if you plan to be 100 passive, your picks are probably not best, especially if you refuse to pivot when terrible news shows up at the front page of every search engine. Thats why they keep screaming toss it in a fund to people who are doing this."

The really hilariously sad part is that you people are only touching the stock out of the fallacious human reasoning of surely it must go back up.

Options were originally intended as a way to hedge your positions, and most hedge funds and serious investors still use them for that purpose. It works something like this Say i bought 10000 shares of nvda a couple years ago. Its gone up huge, lets say i paid 10 a share and theyre worth 100 a share now. I could buy long dated like years puts betting on it going to 50 or less. The puts would be very cheap for me to buy because thats very unlikely to happen but now in case something terrible does happen and nvda does crash my puts will pay off and i wont lose everything.
