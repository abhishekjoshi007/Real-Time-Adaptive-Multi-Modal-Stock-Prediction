Reddit,2024-10-02,"Think about the goal youre trying to achieve. To make money day trading, you want to take advantage of the movement of a stock. The larger the movement, the more of a chance to make money. This is known as volatility. Stocks that have recently had good days are likely to have more if you catch it soon enough. These are top daily performers. Cheap volatile stocks that have performed well recently, will give you a chance to buy a large amount of shares, so if they go up a dollar or so you make at least 300. Some of the stocks that performed well the day before will continue for two more days. Some will spike in the morning and drop off immediately. Some may even drop as soon as the market opens. Selling during the morning spike ensures you get small profits, but try to give it a little bit of time if you can to see if it looks like the day will keep trending upward. If it starts sinking as soon as you buy, get out ASAP. Unless you see the price rising more than sinking. After watching the market from the start of the day to the end a few times, itll be pretty obvious if its going to go your way or not. Youll see stocks going up past the morning spike tend to keep going up. Stocks going down at the beginning of the day tend to keep going down. I think its a safer strategy to bet on obvious trending movements rather than trying to think youll predict a reversal. Thats some peoples entire strategy. Im a gamer, Im just trying to farm easy cash within the rules of the game. It doesnt have to be sophisticated or pretty. Experiment with the simplest strategy you can find. Itll be nerve racking at first but if you really pay attention and learn from your mistakes, and your wins, you can end up winning more than you lose. There will most likely never be a day in which all the top performing stocks one day, tank the next day. Some of them will, but I notice that if I pick a few from that list and the first one doesnt work, usually the next choices do. Dont look for a stock that has just spiked for a second during the day. Find one that has a strong consistent upward trend throughout the day. Your instincts will be that youre buying too high. Like Tom Hougaard says, the market isnt a grocery store, youre not trying to find a bargain. Just because its more expensive today than it was yesterday doesnt mean your chance to capitalize on its performance is over.",Neutral,-1,0.8560779094696045,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-09,"While I am actually on your alls viewsidewhatdafukeva you cant deny the overwhelming opinion that this is a loss of opportunity while you wait. The biggest argument is a high yield savings account HYSA will out pace it in a year. I think thats a bit short sighted because their acting like interest rates will never move lower, but their point still stands, currently you would be better off letting it sit and accumulate interest than bag holding. We dont even have to guess at a timeframe or anything. Just take what you would put in intel and calculate your balance in a high yield savings account over the next 2 years by month. That is literally what you are aiming to beat minimum, otherwise its actually a loss for your risk and effort. If in the next 30 days you sell for a 10 pop, great, but the company literally told everyone expect nothing for a year, and even after that, who boy, just know we are working hard and will update then. The longer you hold, the higher that needs to be just to beat the HYSA. Back to the short sightedness of the HYSA . 1 they probably are not doing that, its just a floor they are using to compare what they are doing with their money ex not giving two craps about a 1 dividend and trying to beat it. Their being smart and not marrying the play, stock or HYSA, and we all should be doing that. If the HYSA is no good, dump it and move to the next channel thats best at that time. The difference between intel and HYSA is you can get out of the HYSA at anytime with 0 loss and invest elsewhere, while Intel may have lost value. They 100 dont make perfect plays, but its hard for them to watch others make dumb plays that cant even track interest rates without saying anything. Bottom line, if you plan to be 100 passive, your picks are probably not best, especially if you refuse to pivot when terrible news shows up at the front page of every search engine.

The really hilariously sad part is that you people are only touching the stock out of the fallacious human reasoning of surely it must go back up. If they beat earnings and pumped 25 that day instead of declined, none of you people would be touching it.

Reddit,2024-08-02,"Take your pick. NTDOY or NTDOF. Im investing in the Super Nintendo Switch and trying to abuse latecycle investor distrust with Nintendos new console track record. The successor sounds like its just iterative, so it should be fine. Bear in mind that Nintendo historically has an early August Pokemon Presents, and the big game reveals tend to have large, often temporary, upswings. Faith in the imminent future propels the stock, and it has downswings whenever the current situation is forced to be highlighted. Im expecting a media blitz this month, and maybe even some first words on the Zelda movie, to draw eyes away from the NOW.",Positive,1,0.6522936224937439,Reply
