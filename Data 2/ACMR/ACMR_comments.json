He wants you to believe that this public company is a complete fake and a fraud, and the stock will slump; however, he claims that  if you listen to his &#34;expertise&#34; (the scam) and buy options on the share price you will become a millionaire (the bait).\n\nHe posts here every day from India using different names (Walker, Bull, Coach, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). Sometimes he is even using Daniel (like my name) to create confusion since I uncovered his hoax. Don&#39;t be fooled by his stupidity, I will always be Daniel10571; in case of doubt always check my profile to verify who is the real one. This scammer seeks to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that he is making a fortune here and could also make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;to invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google Play card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or your financial institution for professional advice on  derivatives if these instruments interest you. Unfortunately the site moderator has not managed to block all these phonies yet."

No, it is not the name of that cesspool you jump in with your bhais often. No mudderchot, it is not that. \nIs perhaps an online hoax that thousands of electronic engineers around the world read unaware that they are being scammed with false information?\nMaybe a web fabrication of the Chinese communist party made in the office of secret Chinese reverse scams? \n\nTo satisfy your ignorance I will tell you that is a known source in the electronics industry with a specialized section on wafer cleaning, electroplating and high frequency semiconductor purification equipment reviews. You may want to check below and learn about the  ACMRsrch furnaces sold, their performance, their current customers and even public press releases. You see, the problem with you (3rd world scammers) is that ignorance, fraud, lies and vulgarity is everything in your lives. See below, read and get some culture in you for a change, babu\n\nimages.app.goo.gl/3JVcRssnQ7xVxXmo9\n\nYou can go back to the cesspool now and try a chinese reverse scammer jump. Remember to shower when you get back home, don&#39;t you go directly to bed without washing it off, although you may be used to that.\n\nGuys, this poster is a scammer. He wants you to believe that this public company is a complete fake and a fraud, and the stock will slump; however, he claims that  if you listen to his &#34;expertise&#34; (the scam) and buy options on the share price you will become a millionaire (the bait). The reality is that this company (ACMRsch) is public, legit, profitable and keeps growing, with production facilities in China and South Korea, offering a suite of state-of-the-art wafer purification products, a customer list that includes some of the top semiconductor producers in the world, and an advanced  R&amp;D group that has granted them several patents in the USA and Japan. \n\nThis scammer posts here every day from India using different names (AC, TG, Walker, Manik, Carl, ACM Rechit, Jamal, Bull, Coach, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). Sometimes he even  posts as Daniel (like my name) to create confusion since I uncovered his hoax. Don&#39;t be fooled by his stupidity, I will always be Daniel10571; in case of doubt always check my profile to verify who is the real one. This scammer seeks to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that he is making a fortune here and could also make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;to invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google Play card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or your financial institution for professional advice on  derivatives if these instruments interest you. Unfortunately the site moderator has not managed to block all these phonies yet."

He wants you to believe that this public company is a complete fake and a fraud, and the stock will slump; however, he claims that  if you listen to his &#34;expertise&#34; (the scam) and buy options on the share price you will become a millionaire (the bait).\n\nHe posts here every day from India using different names (Walker, Bull, Coach, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). Sometimes he is even using Daniel (like my name) to create confusion since I uncovered his hoax. Don&#39;t be fooled by his stupidity, I will always be Daniel10571; in case of doubt always check my profile to verify who is the real one. This scammer seeks to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that he is making a fortune here and could also make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;to invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google Play card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or your financial institution for professional advice on  derivatives if these instruments interest you. Unfortunately the site moderator has not managed to block all these phonies yet."

No mudderchot, it is not that. \nIs perhaps an online hoax that thousands of electronic engineers around the world read unaware that they are being scammed with false information?\nMaybe a web fabrication of the Chinese communist party made in the office of secret Chinese reverse scams? \n\nTo satisfy your ignorance I will tell you that is a known source in the electronics industry with a specialized section on wafer cleaning, electroplating and high frequency semiconductor purification equipment reviews. You may want to check below and learn about the  ACMRsrch furnaces sold, their performance, their current customers and even public press releases. You see, the problem with you (3rd world scammers) is that ignorance, fraud, lies and vulgarity is everything in your lives. See below, read and get some culture in you for a change, babu\n\nimages.app.goo.gl/3JVcRssnQ7xVxXmo9\n\nYou can go back to the cesspool now and try a chinese reverse scammer jump. Remember to shower when you get back home, don&#39;t you go directly to bed without washing it off, although you may be used to that.\n\nGuys, this poster is a scammer. He wants you to believe that this public company is a complete fake and a fraud, and the stock will slump; however, he claims that  if you listen to his &#34;expertise&#34; (the scam) and buy options on the share price you will become a millionaire (the bait). The reality is that this company (ACMRsch) is public, legit, profitable and keeps growing, with production facilities in China and South Korea, offering a suite of state-of-the-art wafer purification products, a customer list that includes some of the top semiconductor producers in the world, and an advanced  R&amp;D group that has granted them several patents in the USA and Japan. As a matter of fact, institutional Investors (including Blackrock, Morgan Stanley and Vanguard) own about 60% of this company.\n\nThis scammer posts here every day from India using different names (AC, TG, Walker, Manik, Carl, ACM Rechit, Jamal, Bull, Coach, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). Sometimes he even  posts as Daniel (like my name) to create confusion since I uncovered his hoax. Don&#39;t be fooled by his stupidity, I will always be Daniel10571; in case of doubt always check my profile to verify who is the real one. This scammer seeks to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that he is making a fortune here and could also make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;to invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google Play card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.

Don&#39;t be fooled by his stupidity, I will always be Daniel10571; in case of doubt always check my profile to verify who is the real one. This scammer wants to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that could make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;to invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google Play card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.

I love the experience of exposing your cracked hoax and by doing so it also provides 3 major benefits to this forum:\n\n1. While posting here and attending to my replies you  can&#39;t be posting somewhere else to induce people to the scam.\n\n2. By taking time from you, you can&#39;t either be fully available to focus on the &#34;options trading teaching&#34; bluff with anyone and take advantage of trusting innocent people.\n\n3. By posting after each of your messages we warn everyone. That alerts every reader about your scam and false expertise. So that everyboy may avoid contacting you.\n\nI am going to love it. It is important to do the right moral thing for the community every once in a while. I really need this.\n\nI am going to love it. It is important to do the right moral thing for the community every once in a while. I really need this.\n\nGuys, don&#39;t fall for this scammer. He posts here every day using different names (Walker, Bull, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations) and hopes  to catch naive folks that would believe his option trading lies; if you buy his rants he will contact you and try to engage you and charge you money for &#34;teaching options trading&#34; and for giving investment advice he is not licensed nor legally registered to give.\n\nEssentially, he randomly picks a volatile stock and just waits for it to fall sharply during a period, and when that happens he claims it confirmed his bizarre predictions, announcing that he can make a fortune with his &#34;options knowledge&#34;. He wants to earn credibility that way and expects to cash from the naivity of the people. That is why he keeps relentlessly posting many times daily -fishing for audience to scam\n\nDon&#39;t fall for this sting, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or to your financial institution for professional advice on derivatives if these instruments interest you. Unfortunately the site  moderator has not managed to block all these phonies yet."

Enjoy the cash but don&#39;t forget to jump in the cesspool to refresh after such a hard day, dada!\n\nGuys, this is exactly what I have tried to warn you about. They want innocent people to fall for their options trading scam that, as you just read, it is very profitable and could make you very rich -that is the bait.\n\nThis scammer posts here every day from India using different names (Walker, Bull, Coach, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). Sometimes he is even using Daniel (like my name) to create confusion since I uncovered his hoax. Don&#39;t be fooled by his stupidity, I will always be Daniel10571; in case of doubt always check my profile to verify who is the real one. This scammer wants to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that could make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;to invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google Play card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or your financial institution for professional advice on  derivatives if these instruments interest you. Unfortunately the site moderator has not managed to block all these phonies yet."

He posts here every day using different names (Walker, Bull, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations) and hopes  to catch credulous folks that would believe his option trading tales; so if you bait he will contact ypu and to charge you for  &#34;teaching&#34; you and for giving investment advice he is not licensed nor qualified for. \n\nEssentially, he randomly picks a volatile stock and just waits for it to fall sharply during a period, and when that happens he claims it confirmed his bizarre predictions and announces that he can make a fortune with his &#34;options knowledge&#34;. He wants to earn credibility that way and expects to cash from the naivity of the people. That is why he keeps relentlessly posting many times daily -fishing for more audience to scam. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or to your financial institution for professional advice on derivatives if these instruments interest you."

When you see a company that has no insider buying but insider selling it can only mean a few things. The most likely cause of the transaction cue to appear that insiders aren’t buying but are only selling means that the insiders acquire the stock through stock based compensation as part of their payment package. If you’re getting paid in stock and it’s a huge part of your payment package it’s why you’d go ahead and sell the stock. Do what you want but I’m not about to let anyone try to fear monger me out of my position because they’re awful at reading company financials. For context one of the largest shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffets company) just sold almost $140 million worth of his stock gained from stock based compensation. He has ZERO buys in the last year. It’s all gained from stock based compensation. Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia , Apple and Amazon all have similar traits about their insider history. Insider buying is not the indication I look at. I look at institutional buying. And institutions are buying this company hand over fist. They have been for a year and a half!"

Craziest part of this is that they have this company , that they must have known is legitimate if they would dare to read and do some actual research instead of being salty they couldn’t dig their hands in its pocket with an ipo, is real. They have customers listed on the American markets. Where this company is named in their financials as a partner and/or competitor. This company is not Gigacloud $GCT. I cannot find not one customer of Gigacloud. And I’m not too awful at research. Anyways. Even worse for shorts is that they went ahead and shorted the company down so far it’s trading at at 17 P/E ratio. The sector trades at a 27 P/E ratio. About %33 below the sector average. So the minimum upside of %33 from here in my opinion. But I believe it’s going to get much more violent than that. The options chain for next week is looking savage. This is no longer a democracy. This is a bull dictatorship."

He wants to earn credibility that way and expects to cash from the naivity of the people. That is why he keeps relentlessly posting many times daily -fishing for audience to scam. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done already.

He wants to earn credibility that way and expects to cash from the naivity of the people. That is why he keeps relentlessly posting many times daily -fishing for audience to scam. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or to your financial institution for professional advice on derivatives if these instruments interest you.

Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.

He posts here every day from India using different names (Walker, Bull, Coach, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). He wants to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that could make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;to invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google Play card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or your financial institution for professional advice on  derivatives if these instruments interest you. Unfortunately the site moderator has not managed to block all these phonies yet."

One thing is that options become more expensive. Another is that market sentiment concerning the stock improves. (And China doing rate cuts and about to start funding their companies to boost their stock prices through share buybacks has already vastly improved sentiment concerning this stock.) Also. Short squeeze can happen. Almost %9 of this companies shares are sold short. Next weeks options chain looks crazy so far. The $19, $20 and $20 strikes are stacked! Some days the calls open interest is literally 10x more than the short open interest. How do you like them apples shorty? Only thing could make this better at this point is if ACM starts buying back its own shares now. And they have a long history (From 2019 to now they’ve spent almost $55 million in buybacks.) In a perfect world they’d start now. Which would make sentiment even more bullish. This isn’t personal shorty. Least for me it’s not. I’m here for money. And you’re in the way. Unduly. Go short a broke company with no TAM. Like $MULN. If you have any money when this is over. 🤣"

About 2 days ago on CNBC , billionaire investor David Tepper was interviewed about the Chinese economy. He spoke about the Chinese equivalent of the Federal Reserve announcing that they will be aggressively lowering interest rates and encouraging companies to buy back shares with government funded loans. \n\nChina may very well end up looking like the American market during COVID. His only concern was “you can’t be short anything Chinese”. And I agree. They’ve sank their economy for longer than us. The companies there are so cheap right now compared to American ones. They’re trading at single digit multiples some of them. Certified good companies. Personally I hope they keep shorting these companies. Get wrecked shorty."

I cannot find not one single case of an American company charged with the kind of fraud I’ve seen alleged by certain individuals on this forum. It’s always an individual, 1 person involved in illegal activities. Not an entire company intent on defrauding American people. Stay with me. Because THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! The punishment for fraud in China is a wide range. From a small fine. To imprisonment and EVEN DEATH in some cases. Xenophobia as a tactic to scare people away is a crafty thing to do. But you must know that fraud in China is taken very seriously. And the Chinese government strongly discourages any Chinese citizen from doing so. Unless it’s to steal technology from America. Which is why I cited earlier in this post that all the cases I saw were corporate espionage. I’m confident that if China finds out one of its citizens defrauded the American people for the sole purpose of money and greed  and not to better China the punishment would be harsh. Go and research this for yourself. It’s a fascinating topic. Now I know thanks to this forum. So thank you. 😎"

Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.

He posts here every day from India using different names (Walker, Bull, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). He wants to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that could make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or your financial institution for professional advice on  derivatives if these instruments interest you.

I own this stock in an aggressive but balanced portfolio. This is not financial advice. But I don’t think it’s a good idea to go all in on any one stock. I own ACM Research in a 5 stock portfolio.

They will not go down not fighting. They will be the leading high end transistor suppliers. Watch. I’m still holding off buying. Building out my other core positions right now. That business may not generate the kind of revenue they need to regain all time highs. This will not impact ACM imo though."

It’s currently a $611 billion industry last reported in 2023. Intel may very well be one of the most undervalued companies on the planet. Shifting to transistors may have been their plan all along after being surprised by Nvidia. How may this impact ACM? The acquisition of Solitron and their US location. They would be ready to ramp up and start soaking up some of that free Chips Act money. I’m a beast at this research thing. That is all. ✊🏾😎"

They have spend tons on R&amp;D to achieve this and have come up with FLOWOP; for which they have 2 patents. No other company had invested that much into cleaning technology. Not yet at least. This can change. As other companies like Tokyo Electron, Applied Materials, KLA Corp, Veeco Instruments &amp; Semes also are researching cleaning tech. But none have been awarded new patents like ACM. A bear attack began in June 2021. This is when they got their patent. Those who are invested in the other cleaning companies probably decided to crush this company with lies and misinformation. Trying to fear monger its investors into selling their stock. So that they could either bankrupt this company for profit. Or crush the price and try to buy its tech. Like ACM did with Soilitron. Hate all you want. The more I look the more I understand how this company works and why it’s traded the way it has. As semiconductors become more complex I expect for cleaning tech to become more and more essential. And he who has the best tech will gobble up market share. Analysts project cleaning to have a %10 cagr until 2030. On a stock with such depressed pricing this is going to blow up in shorts face. It’s going to result in a protracted short squeeze. Like it did the last time."

He posts here every day from India using different names (Walker, Bull, Brad.H, Concerned Citizen....he does the same in other stock conversations). He wants to trap naive folks by fantasizing about his options trading method (puts and calls) and claiming that could make you very rich; once you fall for his lies he will contact you directly and ask you for money &#34;to teach you options trading&#34; and &#34;invest with him&#34;. Of course, once you send him the funds (using a Google card or similar pre-paid) that will be the last you see of that cash. \n\nDon&#39;t fall for this hoax, ignore his false advertisement and silence him, like many have done here already.  Be cautious and reach instead to a licensed broker or your financial institution for professional advice on  derivatives if these instruments interest you. Unfortunately the site moderator has not managed to block all these phonies yet."

Their auditor was an actual Chinese company. Not attached to a reputable western company. The ticker is $GCT. So I’ve been there done that. I warned the forum about it leading into last earnings and they would not listen. They beat expectations again and the stock still dipped. Because of the auditor actually being a Chinese company. Wall Street does not trust their books. And I don’t either. But to try to convince me this company is absolutely illegitimate is not going to work. To try to convince me they are some Chinese scam is absolutely impossible. Not when the evidence of them being reputable as reported by the companies that use them is so reliable. I cannot believe people on this forum. Talking about abandoned freemont facility being abandoned but failing to add the context that they bought the company that used to be housed in the building. Complaining about their auditor having a Chinese arm. As if many companies don’t use that same auditor with the Chinese arm. You’re accusing their western auditor of being compromised and Microsoft and Amazon still using them. Nobody should be that stupid. 🤣"

They usually aren’t that schedule but there are of course outliers. I still don’t like the extra China exposure from this stock because of the reverse merger though. That would be the only reason I may close my position. Because I have exposure to China in another of my concentrated position. Other than that all this nonsense I see in the forum about how this company is a complete scam is totally unfounded. Foundries like TSM Samsung Intel Micron and Texas Instruments name them in their own reports spanning almost more than 5 years in some instances."
