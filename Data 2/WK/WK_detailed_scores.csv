Reddit,2024-10-09,"One thing is that if the main or only reason for buying a stock is because the price looks low, I can tell you that there is always a lower price possible. Other thing though is that sometimes when everyone really hates a stock so much you cant find a buyer and it drops every day, but that same company actually has ok fundamentals or has some redeeming features, that period when its being thrown away can a good time to buy. When meta was said to be going out of business, teens were going to quit it, advertisers fleeing, completion taking everything, whistleblowers reminding us that Zuck and the execs are soulless ghouls, congress going to split it up... well, the balance sheet was actually amazing and the economy was warming up under a new administration. Those two little points of light were why I thought 90 might be a buying opportunity. When Netflix has run out of popular shows and they were getting more cancels per day than signups and management was falsely blaming Russia for their woes, the stock was straight down from 701 to 160 with no buyers in sight. Next stop 99 they said. But there were glimmers. It was the number one streaming service that everybody had. Its the one that seems to work best. And they said anyone who tries to cancel will be offered an adtier option to leave. We know both of those are up like 47x from their obituary moments. Maybe this is the time for Celsius. Or maybe when its 5.",Neutral,0,0.9971133470535278,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-09,"Minor disclaimer I work for a company that makes beverages that contain green tea extract. We have had a ton of meetings concerning what constitutes a safe level of green tea extract consumption. The general consensus is that Celsius is on the high side due to the target audience, consumption patterns, and serving size. The Celsius demographic skews female and 1845, which is absolutely fine. If you have a healthy liver, typical consumption should never be an issue. I repeat never be an issue. But, if you are obese, have a sedentary lifestyle, or have existing liver impairment genetic, alcoholism, etc, then you might want to go easy on it. Where it becomes an issue is twofold its smaller serving size lends itself to multiple servings per day, and due to its enhancing cognitive function of caffeine, people are drinking it solo between meals, so its absorption rate is not ideal for processing in your liver. Once again, in moderation it should be fine. But since its in a small can, you are more likely to get 23 shots a day, and not exercisingmetabolizing it completely since it isnt being paired with food.",Neutral,0,0.9991705417633057,Reply

Not sure what that translates to in terms of market share and im not sure anyone actually tracks it. I doubt Walmart, Amazon or Costco actually report their store brand stuff specifically in financials and even if they did, do they break it down by product? I wouldnt be surprised if generics already accounted for around 30 of the store shelves soda sales. Coke just has a major advantage at restaurants but b2b is a different story. Very hard for anyone to break into b2b because businesses care more about consistency and reliability than about a infinitesimal price difference that wont even make a blip on their bottom line.

Reddit,2024-10-24,"Probably not Probably A lot of people have claimed that TDFs are too conservative for a young investor. I disagree, though it does depend on the fund the investor. Bonds account for very little of the difference in performance between an allUSstock portfolio many TDFs designed for young investors. Bonds have had little impact on the performance of these performance TDFs its mostly been the international stocks. Adding international stocks doesnt make a fund more conservative. Historically, US stocks international stocks have taken turns outperforming each other. US stocks have dominated recently, but that tide could turn at any time. Im most familiar with Vanguards TDFs, so Ill use them as an example. Ive never invested in one, but theyre a great choice for a lot of investors who value convenience are willing to pay a little bit for it. Vanguard TDFs start out with a 9010 stockbond allocation stick with that for many years before starting to gradually shift more towards bonds twentyfive years before the target date. The difference in performance between a 9010 portfolio a 1000 portfolio is usually pretty small, but the difference in risk is usually much larger. This makes it much easier for an investor to hold onto the TDF through a bear market instead of selling in a panic, a move that would cost much more than the performance difference. For a USonly portfolio, over the last 30 years, the performance difference has been less than 0.4 CAGR. However, the risk standard deviation difference has been about 1.5. I expect longer time periods would show similar results. 22 years into this comparison, the 9010 portfolio was slightly ahead. Only the longest bull market in US history created much of a gap. Why then, you may ask, have funds like Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund VTSAX VTI beaten Vanguards TDFs by such a large margin recently? The answer is not bonds its international stocks. So, pick an allUSstock portfolio total market or SP 500 over a TDF if you like. But please understand that the TDF is only slightly more conservative has its own advantages. Of course, past performance is not an indicator of future results. I didnt include international bonds in my analysis because their impact on the portfolio is small. Also, the comparison period would have been much shorter because some years of data are not available for international bonds.",Neutral,0,0.9995410442352295,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-24,"Im bearish on it. Zoomies and alphas dont have nealy the same cereal consumption habits of Millennials and cereal has fallen vastly out of favor and pop cultural icon status from its peak in the 90s. Kelloggs has also been desperate to maintain profits and has resulted in cereal experiencing some of the highest inflation and shrinkflation that would make my waistline blush. General Mills Kellogs has also lost the cereal duopoly from the 90s and theres now a ton of competition. Rather rarely are people buying Kellogg brands these days, let alone cereal to begin with. If you read Kelloggs financial reports, they pretty much routinely state that cereal sales are down and falling. I suspect this was a big driver for the spinoff is that theyve continued to decline, quite substantially. The upside? Well, the profit margins on cereal are obscene so they only have to sell a few boxes a week to make , and they can keep raising prices till a box of Honeycombs Harry Potter is 30box I think the best case to put them into is managed decline. Maybe they can hire some TiKTok Influencers to peddle cereal and get it to become a hot desirable meme amongst the zoomers or something.

Reddit,2024-10-24,My thesis is very simplified 1. Spinoffs are usually hated and disliked by the market for being unloved part of the original company. I genuinely recommend listening to Greenblatts audiobook about his experience in wallstreet. 2. This is a spinoff to a very old company. These type of spinoffs I find special cause they are rare and present a unique opportunity to enter at a very discounted price. 3. Insider buying.

Reddit,2024-09-23,"Thanks for your submission! rWallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that. Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets. Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, were explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics were discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion. Heres an example of a political comment that doesnt offer any value I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot Now compare it to this I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open. The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion. Put succinctly If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then youre in the wrong place and well show you the door. If youre not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and theres probably a better way to post it without making things weird. All that being said, we are here to help.
