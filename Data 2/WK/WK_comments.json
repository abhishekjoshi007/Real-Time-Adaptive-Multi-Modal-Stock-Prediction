Other thing though is that sometimes when everyone really hates a stock so much you cant find a buyer and it drops every day, but that same company actually has ok fundamentals or has some redeeming features, that period when its being thrown away can a good time to buy. When meta was said to be going out of business, teens were going to quit it, advertisers fleeing, completion taking everything, whistleblowers reminding us that Zuck and the execs are soulless ghouls, congress going to split it up... well, the balance sheet was actually amazing and the economy was warming up under a new administration. Those two little points of light were why I thought 90 might be a buying opportunity. When Netflix has run out of popular shows and they were getting more cancels per day than signups and management was falsely blaming Russia for their woes, the stock was straight down from 701 to 160 with no buyers in sight. Next stop 99 they said. But there were glimmers. It was the number one streaming service that everybody had. Its the one that seems to work best. And they said anyone who tries to cancel will be offered an adtier option to leave. We know both of those are up like 47x from their obituary moments. Maybe this is the time for Celsius. Or maybe when its 5."

We have had a ton of meetings concerning what constitutes a safe level of green tea extract consumption. The general consensus is that Celsius is on the high side due to the target audience, consumption patterns, and serving size. The Celsius demographic skews female and 1845, which is absolutely fine. If you have a healthy liver, typical consumption should never be an issue. I repeat never be an issue. But, if you are obese, have a sedentary lifestyle, or have existing liver impairment genetic, alcoholism, etc, then you might want to go easy on it. Where it becomes an issue is twofold its smaller serving size lends itself to multiple servings per day, and due to its enhancing cognitive function of caffeine, people are drinking it solo between meals, so its absorption rate is not ideal for processing in your liver. Once again, in moderation it should be fine. But since its in a small can, you are more likely to get 23 shots a day, and not exercisingmetabolizing it completely since it isnt being paired with food."

Distribution is everything in beverages. When you buy a soda at the movies or drive through lane or grocery store or vending machine or cstore, you get whats on the shelf. Their challenge is being on the shelf. In the unlikely event that someone makes the leap from this terrible article that people are saying to something actually real, the fix is as easy as tinkering down the green tea level a bit, which would save money and probably wouldnt change the taste."

Back then they were not highly regarded but now some folks prefer them. Not sure what that translates to in terms of market share and im not sure anyone actually tracks it. I doubt Walmart, Amazon or Costco actually report their store brand stuff specifically in financials and even if they did, do they break it down by product? I wouldnt be surprised if generics already accounted for around 30 of the store shelves soda sales. Coke just has a major advantage at restaurants but b2b is a different story. Very hard for anyone to break into b2b because businesses care more about consistency and reliability than about a infinitesimal price difference that wont even make a blip on their bottom line. They lose far more money when things arent reliable than how much they might save by going with a competitor product. Thats true for many things in enterprise, not just soda."

Female obesity has dropped a lot. Male has been somewhat flat. Further obesity rates are actually not climbing at all, historically, depending on how you quantify your scales. This is because obesity tends to be highly correlated with wealth. In other words, if we had charts that showed obesity rate by wealth over time, I bet you it has barely changed and ill bet they actually declined the last 50 years. But we prefer to chart it against all people instead of wealth and perception is that its getting worse. It isnt. We are just getting wealthier. Life is easier than it used to be.

Where is the outrage that the NFL, NBA and MLB are causing kids injury? Ultimately, its none of our business as long as they are not hurting anyone else. So yes, when i see that obesity map, I see absolutely nothing to worry about and neither should you because fat folks arent forcing food down your throat. They dont hurt you or me. Further, we as a society, have no shortage of money. If there were an issue with paying the bills, then sure, you can complain, but that isnt the case and our economy has done nothing but boom since the entire antiobesity crusade began since the 90s. Not only that, innovation and invention hasnt slowed even one bit. So once again, that map might as well be toilet paper. In fact as long as we keep innovating the way we are, I could care less if everyone starts to looks like people in the Walle movie. Dont care even one iota. Ive seen enough senseless deaths from cancers to accidents and shootings that I encourage everyone to enjoy their short lives. As long as you dont hurt others, do what you like. If you get joy from eating a steak lathered with butter, go do it. If you like having bulging muscles go for it. Still be productive and work, but enjoy your food.

One interesting thing that stood out to me was that combined obese overweight seemed to be trending down. Meaning that even though obese was flat combined sexes, overweight had to be declining.

Kids were still getting fatter. I have 3 and yea... its my fault. LoL. Two of mine were pudgy. One was resolved with basketball. The other pudgy one is too young twin. The 3rd is too skinny twin..."

If you choose fatty stuff, then its a choice and thats it. And yea wealth still equals more fat people. People dont change chief. Reason being, wealth more free time which translates to more opportunity to eat. It also gives you access to more appetizing meals prepared by professionals though this is less of an impact. Really its about free time. Hence why wealth is so correlated. If you look up the most fat countries in the world, they tend to be ones with a lot of free time and thats usually tied to wealth with some notable exceptions."

                    "text": "Probably not Probably A lot of people have claimed that TDFs are too conservative for a young investor. I disagree, though it does depend on the fund the investor. Bonds account for very little of the difference in performance between an allUSstock portfolio many TDFs designed for young investors. Bonds have had little impact on the performance of these performance TDFs its mostly been the international stocks. Adding international stocks doesnt make a fund more conservative. Historically, US stocks international stocks have taken turns outperforming each other. US stocks have dominated recently, but that tide could turn at any time. Im most familiar with Vanguards TDFs, so Ill use them as an example. Ive never invested in one, but theyre a great choice for a lot of investors who value convenience are willing to pay a little bit for it. Vanguard TDFs start out with a 9010 stockbond allocation stick with that for many years before starting to gradually shift more towards bonds twentyfive years before the target date. The difference in performance between a 9010 portfolio a 1000 portfolio is usually pretty small, but the difference in risk is usually much larger. This makes it much easier for an investor to hold onto the TDF through a bear market instead of selling in a panic, a move that would cost much more than the performance difference. For a USonly portfolio, over the last 30 years, the performance difference has been less than 0.4 CAGR. However, the risk standard deviation difference has been about 1.5. I expect longer time periods would show similar results. 22 years into this comparison, the 9010 portfolio was slightly ahead. Only the longest bull market in US history created much of a gap. Why then, you may ask, have funds like Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund VTSAX VTI beaten Vanguards TDFs by such a large margin recently? The answer is not bonds its international stocks. So, pick an allUSstock portfolio total market or SP 500 over a TDF if you like. But please understand that the TDF is only slightly more conservative has its own advantages. Of course, past performance is not an indicator of future results. I didnt include international bonds in my analysis because their impact on the portfolio is small. Also, the comparison period would have been much shorter because some years of data are not available for international bonds."

A personal brokerage is not a good place for an emergency fund. The last thing you want in an emergency is a devalued account AND a taxable event on top of it, because it was in an investment account. This goes in a High Yield Savings Account HYSA or Certificate of Deposit CD. Youre doing a good job with savings based on what youre putting away now. You have to decide your own risk tolerance and invest accordingly. I dont see anything wrong with a target date fund other than minor nitpicks. There are more aggressive target date funds though, so check there before selecting stocksETFs."

Zoomies and alphas dont have nealy the same cereal consumption habits of Millennials and cereal has fallen vastly out of favor and pop cultural icon status from its peak in the 90s. Kelloggs has also been desperate to maintain profits and has resulted in cereal experiencing some of the highest inflation and shrinkflation that would make my waistline blush. General Mills Kellogs has also lost the cereal duopoly from the 90s and theres now a ton of competition. Rather rarely are people buying Kellogg brands these days, let alone cereal to begin with. If you read Kelloggs financial reports, they pretty much routinely state that cereal sales are down and falling. I suspect this was a big driver for the spinoff is that theyve continued to decline, quite substantially. The upside? Well, the profit margins on cereal are obscene so they only have to sell a few boxes a week to make , and they can keep raising prices till a box of Honeycombs Harry Potter is 30box I think the best case to put them into is managed decline. Maybe they can hire some TiKTok Influencers to peddle cereal and get it to become a hot desirable meme amongst the zoomers or something. But if they arent successful, its not going to be looking good."
