From my perspective, its conservative mgmt that has always beat and raised and outpaced analyst expectations theyve also called out in regards to 26 guidance that it didnt incorporate any new products which theyve had new launches since this guidance was released and will inevitably have more. I also personally disagree that a high growth fintech should be valued as a legacy bank most of which have sub 10 rev growth. If their tech platform really accelerates and gets deals with large financial institutions itll be hard to ignore its part of the valuation delta vs banks. Theyve also leaned into originating for other companies no capital loan origination and loan servicing revenue where they dont take on risk. Its possible that growth completely stagnates in 27 but I dont think itll be that mature of company by then. Right now massive tailwinds for company with interest rate cuts, regulatory changes driving demand for tech platform, significant demand for loans for higher income individuals which is Sofia bread and butter.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"Youre getting such mixed responses and differing views, I think, because this is one of the hardest conundrums that investors face, insanely hard. For me, I look at fundamentals now and going forward along with valuation to decide when and if to trim a position. Ill give you a couple of examples of recent trims and an example of where I havent and my thoughts on your situation. Itd be interesting to look back at this comment a year from now and see if my decision was wise. ANET has been one of my best performers. Bought it at 150ish after Nvidias marketshaking May quarter when the AI craze truly started. In hindsight, I should have bought Nvidia, but ANET felt like it could have more material upside given how unknown it was to the general investing public. Anyway, fastforward to this week. I finally trimmed it. I still have a position in it, but its valuation seems to be getting ahead of its skis and given managements penchant for conservative guides, I could see a disappointment in the cards. Couple that with potential election volatility, I thought I could get a better reentry point. So far, Ive been right. Almost to the dollar I topticked it but I feel apprehension about it. Its hard to trim a stock thats at the forefront of its industry when its industry is at the forefront of new capital allocation. That being said, well see. SITM This one I felt more comfortable trimming. I sold my costbasis after 100 gain. While the companys revenue has cyclically bottomed, I think investors speculators are pumping and preparing to dump this thing. Just about topticked it. Ill get back in if it drops materially. Now when it comes to Meta, heres a company thats at the forefront of AI in actually delivering the product to customers. No matter what people think about the picks and shovels, the companies that can actually make it useful for people will be the real winners. Meta may be one of the true monetizers of AI. On top of that, theyre a cashflow machine helmed by a man who has a newfound appreciation for efficiency. At the same time, hes not afraid to innovate. On top of that, Reels is a real competitor to TikTok, and now they have an X competitor. Instagram remains a strong, growing asset. Facebook is the old workhorse. Falling out of favor with many, it still generates insane revenue. On top of that, its not expensive on a forward basis. To me, Id trim this thing only tactically and get back in quickly.",Neutral,0,0.7465219497680664,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Canada got rid of plastic straws and single use grocery bags. Its been terrible and makes very little difference. The paper straws dont last through a coke from McDonalds and theres reports of the crap in the paper straws being not great for us. The reusable bags at the grocery store are a great concept, BUT, if you forget to pack them, you buy another one. I currently have like 200 reusable bags. Apparently they use like 40x as much plastic as the single use. And still not recyclable. In any given day at work, I create more garbage than I do at home in a year. Although the sentiment is nice, and yes, we should be looking at ways to cut back our impact on the world around us, there are much better places to shift our focus than plastic straws bags and bottles.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Why and why not? I think my concern with China is that the last 5 years or so have seemed like a cycle of 1 new regulationcrackdown largely on tech, which is where Id be primarily interested, 2 stocks go down, 3 China walks back regulationoffers stimulus, 4 China stocks are so back and after enough of a bounce the cycle goes back to 1. And while these names have had a good run lately, looking longer term Tencent is now almost back to the 2018 peak. When I think about names in China that Id most like to own longterm thats certainly at or near the top of the list, but its also clear that the government does not like the sector and they can do what they want but theres other places to invest. Im looking for at least medium and preferrably longterm holdings, optimally Tencent is a good, wellrun company but I feel like investing in China is and maybe things will change at some point? trying to time the 3 part of the cycle above and sell before 4 is over and the cycle starts again. If say gaming is going to be something thats going to continually encounter regulations in China, Id rather look at a TTWO still around the level where it announced the GTAVI trailer and which is above 2018 highs. Im not against China and great to anyone who did well with the recent move although some of the BABA discussion in particular feels like a fair amount of this, given how many times people have tried to call the bottom in recent years even after the recent move its still down 36 over the last 5 years while AMZN 115.

Reddit,2024-10-06,"Many Fed officials are kinda panicking, while trying hard to not look like it. Powell took the risk of starting the cutting cycle with 50 basis point, and probably tried really hard to convince multiple Fed officials to go along with the 50 bps cut I think Barkin, Waller, Schmid, Logan, Musalem, Bostic wouldve all preferred starting with 25 bps and 75bps total in 2024. 7 people wanted 75 bps total in 2024 and 2 wanted 50 bps cut total in 2024. So to start with 50 bps cut and only cut 25 bps in 1 out of 2 remaining meetings, just gives off an inconsistentbizarre message instead of 25 bps in each of the 3 remaining meetings. Even if the economy is fine, doing so really risks the financial market taking it the wrong way and thinking the Fed is worried about recession. So if market thinks so and sell off, that would kill consumer sentiments, and would lead to an actual recession. So thats the big risk. Theres really no huge benefit to 50 bps cut other than if the Fed needs to cut 75bps in the next meeting to react to a recession, they are in a better position to do so. If they cut 25 basis point in Sept and gave a really dovish speech, even saying theyll cut 50 bps in Nov, the market wouldve priced in more Fed cuts, and the net effect on financial condition wouldve been pretty similar. So I wasnt sure why they did the 50 bps cut for minimal benefits and huge tail risk. Its even more bizarre they made that decision during the blackout no communication period, which further gives the impression theyre panicking. As you can see below, were at the same restrictiveness as where we were in summer 2022 when Fed fund rate was around 2, and the loosening happened in May 2024, months ago. Of course lower inflation gave the Fed reason to cut 50 bps. But doing so 1.5 months early makes little difference, and they took huge risk of the market misinterpreting the message. So I dont know why they did that, if they werent actually concerned themselves. Maybe their local business contacts have been telling them negative things.",Neutral,0,0.9179418683052063,Reply

Practically every other country does, we dont and politicians at this point choose not to. In the case of obesity and diabetes PBMs drive up list prices during negotiations so they can get favorable rebates. PBMs are middlemen that are also publicly traded like Cigna and CVS so they stand to lose more performance wise if they dont keep those prices high. NVO could slash prices and still keep a very healthy margin and potentially even sell more volume, but if they dont agree to PBM list prices they risk getting removed from their formularies which means lower sales all together and people not getting medication from NVO.

Reddit,2024-10-02,"HIMS is something Im a bit weary of. They have an oral medication thats only a shortterm treatment, and its not a compounded medication so it would be less effective than your traditional GLP1. Plus from what I understand its 2400 upfront for a year or something like 250400 per month. Being noncompounded its not as effective and not intended to be a long term treatment. So it doesnt work for everyone and I dont think its covered by insurance. In that regard it sounds like a niche market. It should be noted that none of what it sells is FDA approved. Not sure if this would really affect their oral medications. As for the GLP1 HIMS recently began offering, this would be compounded and can be a longer term treatment, but my understanding is theyre only allowed to sell this in the first place because theres a shortage right now. Ifwhen Nordisk ends its shortage on GLP1s I think the FDA at that point would demand HIMS to pull GLP1s from their shelves. So yes, they do have that loophole to sell without approval because of the shortages, but at the same time we dont even know if HIMS is violating patents or is unsafe and ineffective as far as their GLP1s go. Personally, Im not a fan of tossing someone desperate to lose weight who took a 10 minute survey and never talked to a doctor some drugs to inject into themselves.

It does not look like a confidence inspiring medical device company HQ on the 2015 street view you can clearly see the address on the front of the building as per listed on their website. By the 2019 street view, it has faded off almost completely. Their US address seems to be some sort of Weworky coworking space. If you look up the Canadian address and their former business name Picomole there are pictures of the company in a meeting on the Google listing and it looks like some sort of Canadian microcap medical device version of The Office. This is a Canadian microcap medical device co in an early stage. At the midpoint of the proposed range, Breathe BioMedical would command a fully diluted market value of 54 million. IMO, when you are looking at that sort of microcap it becomes are there signs that the story might be less than advertised?

Reddit,2024-09-27,"Yeah sorry I didnt give any examples because I thought it was obvious, so the first that comes to mind is Zynga Zynga made other mistakes, but early on.. after their IPO, they were losing money, so with their cash IPO cash secondary offering they bought a 2B HQ and then threw their other 2B around While at first, they did buy small game companies good for their core biz, they didnt have the funds to buy larger game companies to feed the stock, so they had to go super indie. Those indie devs mostly pumped out crap, so when that didnt work, they started renting out the HQ to ventures of all kinds of BS and even killed off some of their core games to save money not good for their core biz. Zynga did have a happy ending, only because they stopped fucking with their core business focused on their last remaining good games went profitable and got bought out. For GME to turn around, it needs to focus on its core business rather than trying to get lucky, for example Retail isnt a weakness and a lot of gamers look forward looked forward I should start saying to going to a GameStop. GME is already fucking this up. If GME wants to RD, thats fine, but it should bring them back to selling gamers games renting out used games which no one in charge of running GameStop the company knows how to improve upon or do that forever because theyre wasting their time with all that other BS. All GMEs other ideas have just been about spiking the stock price up secondary offerings, something that penny stocks do on a daily basis, and while that was comical at first, its going to get bad stop working, and their cash reserves will just end up paying their expenses theyll dry up and die.

Reddit,2024-09-27,I do not know much about Rivian.. but as an investor for you to make money they have to sell a lot more vehicles at profit while investing in massive factories and competing with other players Instead I would bet on lithium miners like albamerle or sqm and other lithium lifecycle companies beyond miners. I heard battery might be commoditized .. so maybe battery recycling. Think what changes in the car architecture.. more motors more copper more high voltage electric lines and interconnects .. companies like molex amphenol comes to mind. Then semiconductors that focus on power conversions and controls like nxp infineon renesas will also win irrespective of who sells more EV. Then there are utility companies which should see more demand along with data centers. There is massive work in EV infrastructure and charging but again focus on the vendors and not necessarily blink or charge point. Along with ev.. there will be a shift to automation .. the players making the cameras lidar chips and software would make more profit than waymo Tesla or gm who are competing to bring the vehicles. It doesnt mean that Rivian or Tesla is a bad investment but its no longer a first mover environment... I have no idea of knowing if they will or will not but if I trust that EV is going to be the future.. then I would bet on the supply chain. Solar might be a big winner in EV . Not so much in data center case. Think ancillary issues... Charging time is still a problem... Land is limited... You want chargers in strategic location. Who has land that might become useless with ev chargers.. think the gas stations... So they will transition there with scope of commercial real estate developing. Else the grid will transition to micro grid with battery storage becoming more critical.,Neutral,0,0.9901494979858398,Reply

Its eh, because its a niche car for a niche price that only 0.5 of the worlds population has the capital to afford. So realistically, it isnt cutting into their bottom line as much as it sounds because VW still has audi and several other brands that are rebounding the loss from bugatti. But rivian is selling to the general public an EV that they claim is competitive to tesla, and announving that they are losing 32,000 per vehicle, which granted, from q4 23 losing 43k to now theyre reducing that number sure, but thats still per car world wide.

Reddit,2024-09-27,I like Albemarle that is easy.. I think the rest are ok but these are capital intensive companies and many of them dont have great financials or are based in countries with lax rules or risk of nationalization. Also different companies have different price agreements. Lithiums main risk is technological developments that reduce its content in battery. I would also look at catalyst and previous or rare earth metals too. Unfortunately I havent had a chance to do so much research to suggest names at this point. As the saying goes do not trust an internet stranger. If you like the ideas.. do your own research and share your ideas too. Just note I have a very long time window in investing and generally buy a company and dont sell even if it goes through a downturn.. right now I have large losses in Albemarle and SEDG and many solar companies but I hold them.. I believe its gonna be a rough ride but long term people will migrate to solar and now nuclear too. Similarly .. people will transition to EV but its going to take time to do so. You can get many of these companies for cheap now btw.,Negative,-1,0.9573839902877808,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"10 plus years now. Lost money for the first six or seven years I was trading, blew up to accounts. I trade a lot of statistics but theres one Ive been looking at that practically anyone could do that seems incredibly useful. So if you look at the run in the 90s or even the recent run this decade if someone had small positions in companies or an ideas that had a future or they thought had a future. Even if you get a few wrong. One or two of those can make you an absolute mint. So its kind of an experiment with the majority of your money being in the sp 500 but you have a 10 or 20 allocation you mess around with looking for these breakthrough ideas but rather than selling them when you get a 10 profit or 20 or whatever, you let the idea play out which is where the big money has been. The hard part is figuring out what the next company to do that is going to be or where you can get those multiples or how long they are going to go The majority of my outperformance has came from being short theta and anticipating where the market is going to go before it does. I know that last part might sound cliche but buying TLT when its in the 80s, you see that 50 correction from the top, you start shorting puts down there that are one or two years out. You start buying the shares. Cyclical companies like UPS, massive correction from COVID, back down to its original trend line, big dividend, you buy some shares, you short some puts. The small cat play, load up there, also loaded up on BTC beginning in 2016, didnt sell the top in 2017, didnt have that much but I did unload in 2021 and paid off my house and then some. I think that one is setting up to go again but even if Im wrong the risk is asymmetrical which is the type of trade you should be looking for. Its like if youre wrong you lose 20 30 40 50 but if youre right you make Xs. That account I started in 2017 with 5,000 is now worth a little over 200k but the part thats seriously impressive and I would say this to anyone if they accomplished similar is that no one trade really did it. That growth is from tens of thousands of trades with a high percent profitability. My win rate is pretty crazy its 65 to 70 and the gains are also larger than the losses. Biggest loss this year was Intel, short 30 puts which definitely got put to me but I took in so much premium for selling them, Im already almost back to break even so well see how that goes If anyone is going to even attempt to be an active trader, you need all the education you can get. If your resourceful you should be able to figure out how to get the courses from profitable people like Adam khoo, anton from the institute of trading, the old IBD courses, the chart guys, krown, there are downloads of all of these out there and no Im not going to tell you where, thats part of the fun, if you want it bad enough, youll find it.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"I have probably made around 30 returns per annum since 201718, roughly 25 in Dollar terms in Indian Stock market where the market has returned 1215 in dollar terms so Im sure my principals would work in US markets as well. I dont try to find companies or even ETFs with higher expected returns, the key is to find negatively correlated assets with equity and put part of your portfolio in those instrumentslike LEAPS, Treasury bills, Tail risk hedges etc.. The way you beat the market via this, and Im sure even Warren Buffett beats the market because of this is 2 reasons. 1. When the markets are down, say Covid or even during the inflation heating up 202223 ish and the subsequent selloff in stocks, I sell the non equity componentwhich is now sitting at profits because its price moves opposite to stocks to buy stocks, ETFs or whatever you prefer for your exposure to equity. 2. Your volatility drag is reduced, this concept needs a bit of a deeper understanding but basically if a stock is at 100 goes down 20 to 80 and then goes up by 25 to reach back 100, if Im able to avoid the 20 downturn and only gain exposure to the 25 up move I would make 25 while other people have broken even. The derivation is more nuanced and conceptual than this so try reading it up on google, what Ive told you is an oversimplification. Now because of my portfolio positioning is like this, I can take on higher risk, generally and in CAPM world also, more volatile pockets of the asset marketslike smallcaps, junk bonds etc. have higher returns, but in downturns they fall harder than the Blue chipsApple, Nvidia etc. like the ones in DJIA index so we say these assets are more risky than mainstream Blue chips, given my exposure to downturns is reduced due to my non stock component but the upside is mine I can generate a higher profit than being invested in the SP 500 alone",Neutral,0,0.9966042041778564,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"For Tesla I did months of research in advance on all sorts of things, not just about Tesla but EVs in general, and the automobile industry. I came to the conclusion from my research that 1 Teslas EVs are clearly superior to all the competition especially back in 2019. 2 The competition was no only awful at designing EVs for the most part, but most automakers were heavily dragging their feet on EVs, which was only going to help Tesla farther since it takes 3 years on average for them to bring a new vehicle to market. 3 Scurve adoption of new technology met that EV sales are going to explode overtime and they have worldwide since 2019, despite the slowdown the last year or two, which met that Tesla could easily continue to grow their sales plenty even when the other automakers finally start getting their act together. 4 I believed that several other automakers were almost certainly going to go bankrupt or need a big government bailout from failing to transition to EVs, which was only going to help Tesla farther as todays biggest players in the auto market imploded. I took profits in Tesla, and eventually sold out of it due to valuation concerns, and cyclicality in the auto business. I just didnt see a rational bull case to pump the stock up much more for a while. IMO in the short term Tesla bet on the wrong horse putting more focus on FSD than a cheaper Model 2 to continue to expand their market share and destroy their competitors profitable ICE vehicle market in cheaper vehicle segments.

I was originally focused mostly on dividend paying stocks in my earlier years, and invested in a lot of companies back then that I would never touch today MMM, JNJ, JPM, PEP because I just dont get their industry enough to feel comfortable investing in them. Im much more selective in the kinds of stocks I invest in today.

Mine cost me 5000 after the insurance pays their share, and theyre several years old now. The insides have been upgraded replaced once already but I cant afford a full replacement. The battery lasts a full week of daytime use, and programming is part of the service the doctor provides, so I cannot customize it. I do, however, have copies of all my hearing tests for the last 10 years, so I can see how it has changed and can extrapolate reasonably well. Plus, Apple claims theyll provide a hearing test feature. If Apple provides all those same frequencies, it would be truly game changing. The Airpods Pro 2 are ungainly and only last 6 hours, but for about 250 each I could afford to buy two pair and charge one while wearing the other pair, then swap out when theyre spent. Given culture the way it is today, I can get away with wearing them anywhere, too. Plus, listening to music on them would be a far better experience than anything my current hearing aids can do since they require a loop necklace antenna and buggy bluetooth sync to work today. That will be a huge win for Apple right there. Finally, I could easily build a set of microphones to feed into the Airpods. I work with Raspberry Pi and IoT all the time, so assembling and programming a microphone array would not take more than a month for me.

The question is whether the remainder of the market will be sufficient to move the needle on APPL stock. The answer lies is whether Apple can develop the ecosystem further in a way that causes a 1400 hearing aid user to buy an iPhone instead of Samsung.

Reddit,2024-09-15,"First of all, hearing aid thing is not ground breaking at all. It has been in the works in the industry for a couple of years, every single earphone company is working on it. Gn resound had something like this a year back. But why now? US FDA changed regulations around sharing aids sometime in 2019 or so, and they allowed hearing aid to be sold over the counter. This enabled consumer companies like Apple to roll this out. So, is the apple one any good? Not really. Its a gimmick. Why? Apple AirPods only last 67 hours with a single charge and continuous playback hearing aid feature is effectively continuous playback mode. This is not usable for most people. Medical grade hearing aids last 34 days with one battery. You dont want grandma worrying about charging her AirPods every 6 hours and sit down for an hour for it to charge without hearing. This is why traditional hearing aids last multiple days. This is a nothing burger. They already had the transparency mode, which passes through external sounds to the ear. Hearing Aid mode is basically amplifying it and playing it louder, with some additional minor challenges. If you are looking for Apple and health, this aint it. Apple HealthKit is more promising. More and more medical grade devices now integrate with Apple HealthKit and their fertility tracking etc is getting really really good. Recently, FDA allowed Dexcomm to sell their continuous glucose monitor directly to customers and dexcom is now working with Apple HealthKit giving Apple glucose data from users. This is a medical grade FDA cleared device used by millions of people who are diabeticpre diabetic .

Reddit,2024-09-15,"Everyone knows they will raise the price of them iteratively, until eventually a version comes out that will be the same price as an old hearing aid used to be. Inflation, new tech, new costs of production or distribution will be blamed, its whatever. Consumers will stick with Apple regardless of cost like usual, and things will continue status quo with one new product Airpods again... but theyre also hearing aids now involved. Inflation will normalize it for the sidelines. On top of the fact that the biggest argument against Apple is already the cost, so I dont know why you thought this would do anything. Deaf people in the market for a new hearing aid is not exactly a massive market to switch nonApple people into new Apple people. It is an important and altruistic market for someone to reach, but in this case its not going to move things significantly for a long time, and since were talking about Apple, it will probably look like part of a normal broad increase as they also continue to improve other areas of their business.

For travel she might even toss three into her bag. The cost is negligible compared to closing a single deal and her company allows her to expense them as a consumable. If you use them heavy they last about 18mo or so before needing to be trashed due to battery wear.

Reddit,2024-09-15,"Its a terrible company. A few years after the interest in meme stocks, it does still feel like every situation like this gets looked at as some sort of potential lottery ticket rather than the bad company it is. Itll be nice when it gets back to the view that the majority of these situations are genuinely bad companies and the that are actually worthwhile turnarounds is probably low single digit at best. Is it going to 0? Quite possible. Could it short squeeze? Sure, 30 short interest but that would likely require good news and the news earlier this week that it was ruled that Hertz underpaid bond holders post prior bankruptcy by 270M is definitely not positive. Im sure that will be appealed, but if they have to pay 270M at this point after the decline in the business that its had in recent years, that will be a problem. They are trading at 3usd as of writing this and its so far down over the past few years it looks like its on a path to 0. I mean, were talking about a company that went public again in 2021 after bankruptcy and has proceeded to lose about 87.5 since in pretty much a straight line as someone else noted, the move into EVs went very poorly and certainly didnt help.

Reddit,2024-09-04,"Depends on what you need to make you happy. I imagine having a minimalist dwelling in a village while exploring with a motorcycle. This wouldnt cost much and I would have a ton of fun. Malaysia has dirt cheap gas prices, one of the lowest in the world. There are whats known as kumpung villages there. Theyre tightly knit communities where everyone helps each other. I met this Thai uncle in one of those communities and he showed me his little garden with chickens and he said he shares them with the village. He also showed me research papers he published on the caves around his village, so its not like you have uncivilized uneducated people living there. I went to a rural farm village in China with absolutely breathtaking scenery at a place called Yangshuo. Met some really nice people there with a homestay. They also had a small farm there and cooked farm fresh food. The whole village looked old and run down but its funny that they pulled out with an Audi SUV.

Reddit,2024-09-04,"Honestly I can just say I think its totally worth it to at least have 500 youre willing to lose as an experiment in Bitcoin and leave it alone a few years, just out of curiosity. Ive been DCA or Dollar Cost Averaging in for years now. I hope to someday have a full coin. I ignored it for years and thought it was fringe bullshit and then kept hearing about the price going up. I remember working with an older guy in a tech job a few years back and he was oldschool wallstreet and was a millionaire, but wanted to learn about tech so he took a low paying PM role at my company just to learn the ins and outs of tech. He was telling me that bitcoin was the most successful stock hed ever had. At the time it had gone up to idk around 5000 dollars and he and a bunch of the dev guys I worked with got in early so I figured it was over and not worth buying in. But if you watch year after year trend, it keeps going up. I used to be in a signal group on Telegram and a guy mentioned FEG token so I bought in super early at 500. After several months, it shot up all of a sudden to 45,000 100X basically because China was pouring into it. Then it immediately shot back down because they found an offensive social media post with a caricature of a Chinese leader and banned it. I never cashed out bc it happened so fast and I didnt know where the top was in the moment. Now its worthless. But the point is, the opportunities are there, but its like the wild west. I am pretty much just a basic bitch now when it comes to crypto, I just buy 50 or so whenever I get paid of bitcoin no matter the cost. I would just use an exchange like Kraken or Binance, or Coinbase because its easy, and buy some and if you ever accumulate a lot you would want to transfer it off the exchange and into a cold wallet but I wouldnt worry about that til you have enough that it matters. I am not sure about specific videos, Ive just watched a ton of general ones about it, learning about blockchain, Satoshi, halving, etc those are the main concepts. Its kind of like how they say I dont know how my car works, but I still want to drive it. Its a complex technology and very worth learning about.

Here are the things I did not like versus Fidelity 1 Fidelity auto sweeps my cash to a money market account paying 5. Schwab does not and pays a paltry 0.35 on this cash. 2 Fidelity pays out dividends to customers the same day companies pay out. Schwab holds this cash for an extra day and pays out a day later. 3 Schwabs site experienced 3 crashes at the open when I was looking to trade.

My account rep at TD Ameritrade was awesome and moved over to Schwab.

Fidelity allows two phone numbers to be set up to access an account via two factor authentication.

Reddit,2024-09-01,"I worked for a competitor of IBM for years, so I acknowledge my bias. That said, I found IBM to be a kind of cult to many customers in the 80s and 90s, and a few even now. At first, enterprises looked at IBM as the Cadillac of computing. They locked in many places with their mainframe computing the IBM 360 was a staple of business. The biggest places had sales staff with personal relations to the C level of enterprises and sole sourced the equipment. UNIVAC, DEC, Tandem and others to a lesser extent. As the 80s and 90s rolled around, Big Blue kept high prices on their Cadillac and although they rolled out their UNIX AIX and virtually invented the PC, the pricing was high, proprietary in an open source minded world and they lost market share. For one retail company, the Bd of Directors required competitive bidding, and even though any competitor could provide less price and equal or superior function, IBM would be awarded the work because we are used to them. Finally others stopped bidding the pointless exercise it was just to press IBM to keep their pricing down. When the old guard retired, and the enterprise realized the premium they paid for obsolete proprietary systems it was too late. They still used the IBM OS2 PC into the 2000s. They went from sales of billions to bankruptcy. I am convinced their cult belief in IBM and failure to modernize contributed. I did a study for multiple companies that illustrated if they moved off the bloated AIX systems to competitive systems, they would save millions. The paradigm shift always seemed risky, but those that moved were well rewarded. In the last 15 years, where IBM competed against Dell, HPHPE, Fujitsu, Amazon, Microsoft and others for data center refresh, cloud and other updates, they rarely stood the test, unless it was from one of those cultist enterprises who had decided before the bid. They still have a mainframe market it is expensive to migrate but not impossible. Their database product , PC, AIX and others are considered by most to be old iron. Even their cloud is a bit proprietary and pricey iron cloud. Watson has been discussed Their quantum computing research is admirable but given their history of trying to make things proprietary so they can keep price and margin high, I wont expect it to play well with others. It is vaporware somewhat. All said, their sales and margins and employee count are down to 23 of the numbers 10 years ago. The legacy of arrogance. I vote thumbs down.

Reddit,2024-08-28,"The biggest problem wrong with your analysis, is not realizing chipotle recently had a 501 share split. Chipotle stock was actually trading above 3000share recently. So its not accurate to say cava stock is more expensive than chipotle. If anything Cava is wayyyyy cheaper than chipotle. I bought cava a while ago at 35share. Love the stock, love the brand, and I love the food. Its not for everyone though. More people will like chipotle because overall Id say people are more likely to eat Mexican than Mediterranean. But tons of people LOVE cava. My wife and I are both obsessed. Reasons I like the stock tons of room for growth. They are growing organically they are not a franchise so your average Joe Shmoe cant just open up a cava franchise. Theyre carefully selected by the cava corporation so that they dont negatively affect other cava locations. I also enjoy this part because of quality control if some Joe Schmoe opens up a location and does a bad job managing it, the product will worsen. Just like tons of subways opened up and plenty of them were in bad locations or were not managed that well out of bread etc. Hopefully wont have this problem with Cava. There are also so many areas around the country that dont have a cava. Huge growth potential. They could open up near every college in the United States and be successfully most likely but theres only about 300 locations total. They plan to open up another 700 in the next 8 years. Theyre already profitable and the margins are good which I love to hear. Revenue year over year is increasing, same store sales is increasing year over year even with new locations opening up. All these things make me bullish on the stock. And most importantly, my wife and I really enjoy the food. Its healthy and refreshing.

I work in film and a lot of people struggle, especially starting out, with making enough money to just pay rent so they are constantly taking jobs that are not rewarding or enjoyable or valuable for their longterm goals and it exhausts them. Investing allowed me to take financial riskssacrifices to work with the filmmakers I wanted to learn from, allowed me to do jobs for free or little money because I wanted the connection or the experience and knowledge. And now all of those things are paying off as Im starting to get paid really well to continue to work on top level projects with great people while also taking that experience and knowledge and confidence to help my friends make their projects and raise them up.

I took my small managed account from a job I had 30 years ago and also a large to me chunk of cash from a home sale and move that netted us about 100k in 2019. All in I took about 130k in 2019 and really focussed for about a month on researching and planning our portfolio for a 10 year period to see if I could make significant difference in our wealth. I also did this because I will have 2 kids in college at that time. While it hasnt always been a pretty chart, I have managed to 4x that initial sum with no additional contributions. So much so that we have also transferred all the accounts into my management. My simple approach of seeking 10 minimum growth annually and rolling all dividends into speculation equities or higher growth potential holdings. If you are up 30 including the last 4 years which means likely your initial investment had a big drop in Feb 20 unless you timed that perfectly. I would say you are on the right track, and as you should be able to start seeing that sum increase exponentially. At an average of 10 growth you would double in just over 7 years. And as you approach 2030 growth you are doubling every 2 and a 12 years. As far as being rich, thats an impossible number to quantify. But I have taken 100k and in less than 10 years managed to have that 100k currently add 100k every year for 2 years straight.

Reddit,2024-08-21,"Anyone ? Yes. But you have to understand the risk involved with getting rich in a short time span. 30 is decent growth but your mistake is that youre kinda aimless in your approach and Im assuming very risk averse. You say you made this portfolio 4 years ago. Depending on when exactly in 2020 you did that, considering the nose dive and massive rebound the economy experienced, you could have been up at least 70 if not more if your money was on something like QQQ for example. And before people start howling about how irresponsible something like this is, its not, if you know what youre doing. Ok maybe 70 is not exactly right since it doesnt account for the contributions spread across the 4 year time frame, but the point is, if youre not touching that money for the next 51020 years, why the SP500 and not the top 100? Its pretty much the same chart with a wider range. Higher highs and lower lows, better long term growth. If youre putting money in the sp and all world and a handful of companies that are so big they have no real room to grow anymore, it paints the picture of someone who wants gains without the risk of ever seeing his investment go red even momentarily. Thats fine, thats understandable, its the right approach for many people, but if you want to maximise growth, then youre not doing it right, rather youre going at it blind. Chasing growth means treating your investment like a time capsule, you do not touch that money for a good long while, you define your time frame and plan a strategy accordingly. Also the alternative of not investing doesnt really do anyone any good. You work, you make money, you save, theres no benefit of having your savings sit and do nothing. Even with modest growth youre still getting free money for doing nothing. You want to hit it big? You can try, but that comes with more risk, and for 99.9 of people, its not worth it.

Reddit,2024-08-21,"The big issue is compounding, so even if youre a good trader. You start running math. If you start with 10 or 20,000 and you add along the way. Youre an exceptional trader, your averaging 25 to 30 of your returns. Doubling your money every 3 years. Its going to take you 15 years of actively being in front of the screen all day and doing your research and doing everything just to hit a hundred grand. Say you out a little along the way and you juice this up to 150. Its also unlikely youre going to be this good of a trader until youre at least 30 years old. You have to build your model, learn your stats, start thinking win loss ratios, get a really good handle on economics, understand technicals, all of it. Now we are 45 years old and we have a couple hundred thousand dollars. It does begin to compound rather quickly up here but the problem is youre getting older. Youre going to be in your 50s by the time you have just 1 million To make real money you need inherited wealth or you need to work in a job that has the potential of paying an extremely high salary so you can compound your wealth at a lower return and still do well. If you can land a sixfigure job and live frugally, your ability of getting your first million by the time youre 40 is fairly substantial. Moving on if we look at people who have actual wealth, 50 million maybe. They only need to take 10 million of that and put it in TLT, 4 a year dividend payment. Thats 400,000 a year they get for sitting around and buying the bottom of the bond market. They still have another 40 million full of property investments, other shares they hold. The rate they can compound their wealth is so far beyond what the average person could ever achieve. This little story right here is why we have such wealth inequality and why its only going to get worse as time goes on. Think about the amount of assets this person can buy. His children can buy, the snowball keeps growing.",Neutral,0,0.9959003329277039,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-21,"Disclaimer Im not actually there yet, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. How long did it take for your portfolio to reach a point where the annual passive income matched or exceeded your annual salary? 10 average returns suggests 10x income. I think for those of us with reasonably high income, thats probably 1020 years depending on how assiduously you save... Though for those living hand to mouth, it can be much rougher to try and save an appreciable amount of money. When did you feel comfortable enough with your portfolios performance and size to consider retiring or achieving financial independence. Im counting FI as about 25x expenses I could make ends meet indefinitely with 60k a year, so about 1.5M for me. For RE, Id like more like 2.5M. Partly to account for inflation that would happen between hitting 1.5M and 2.5M, but mostly to just have more breathing room so I could do things like blow 15k on a vacation just because. Though Ive been blowing a lot on vacations the last few years while working, so maybe Ill be tired of it by the time I get around to retiring. I have a loose plan in my head to spend my first retirement year living cheap, just to set sort of a baseline and make sure I didnt totally underestimate costs. Specifically, how long did it take before you felt your portfolio could sustain your lifestyle without the need for additional income from employment? 12 years from 100k to 1.5M, 16 years from 100k to 2.5M. The later years are still projected, but my projections have proven reasonably accurate thus far.

Reddit,2024-08-21,"You need some money to make money. If you string together a set of solid bets, you can really multiply your money. I started investing around the year 2000 trying different strategies. Since I work in tech, I invested in tech because I felt like I knew it better than other industries. During the 2000s I held Apple for about 8 years starting from when the iPhone was announced . I also bought some Amazon that in the mid2000s that Ive never sold and still hold today. I bought Facebook back when they IPOed. I bought Tesla when they announced the Model 3 and never sold. There are other trades that Ive made but these are examples of my winners. When I started I used to diversity across a number of different stocks, mutual funds, index funds, etfs. I played with blue chip, international funds, small cap, etc. But over time I realized my best returns all came from tech because its pretty much been the boon to the economy for the last 30 years. So overtime I simplified my investments into fewer and fewer stocks and only held tech. Of the stocks I held, I did still try to diversify my risk. Ive posted about it online and people often will troll me about my lack of diversification but Ive grown my money considerably. I dont recommend it for everyone. But you dont need to be some crazy Gamestop investor or go wild with stock futures. Just keep hitting solid singles, doubles and home runs with decent money behind them, and you can grow your money in a decently safe manner for 12 decades.

Reddit,2024-08-21,"Yes. But you have to start early, be disciplined, invest significantly, and let time to the work. Nominally, if you start at 22 postcollege for sake of argument, invest 1kmo in an SP, at 65 43 years of investing, you will have approximately 7.5M. Time, inflation, and individual circumstances is going to necessarily vary your result, but the point is that time will do the work for you. But you have to start, you have to be determined it might be hard to do 1kmo on your first salary, diligent, disciplined, and have a bias toward saving. I didnt start at 22, but I do have a military pension, which offsets some of my tardiness. Also, as you grow in your career, that bias for saving is really important. For me, I determined in my nonmilitary working life to max 401k and other retirement account savings as rapidly as possible. I, and my wife do that now. We make a pretty decent amount of income, but we save about 45 all totaled. Were mid50s now, and well on track to be at numbers similar to above at 65. In fact, 7.5M is overshooting the mark for our purposes to be riskfree and welloff in retirement, so were actually now looking at 62. Retiring at 59 is in the realm of possibility, but at a reduced outlook, though still relatively risk free...just not traveling the world in the way and style we plan. I built a model recently that looked at if Id started at 22 with my current approach, and even with necessarily less investment earlier in life because my income wouldnt support max contributions, I would more likely hit about 20M by 65. That is rich by just about anyones measure, unless we have hyperinflation for the next 9 years. Investment folks out of NY or tech entrepreneurs could swamp that by an order of magitude or two. But for the average dude on the street, working W2 or 1099, thats a pretty good result using a straightforward, uncomplicated approach available to anyone. For most of us, thats all we need. Once you hit accredited investor level, other options may become available that can help you get there more quickly. But, as always, at elevated risk levels. Ive got a few 10s of thousand in a couple of those. But they are really play rather than my serious retirement plans.",Neutral,0,0.9997767806053162,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-21,"Im in my late 40s. My wife and I have been maxing out our 401Ks since our early 30s and now have about 1.2M in 401k savings plus another 1M split between our brokerage and the equity in our home. I felt the same way you did until a few years ago. For me building my portfolio was excruciatingly slow work...until suddenly it wasnt. Now a 10 annual return is 200k. Were hoping to retire in about 5 years. Ill have a small pension 2500mo that kicks in at 62yo and well both have social security eventually. So if we take social security at 67yo, we should have an income of about 70kyear on top of our savings. The challenge as I see it will be bridging that 15 to 20year gap between retirement and receipt MedicareSocial Security. Once were not working, health insurance for the two of us will be about 2500mo and it will only go up as we age. Between health insurance and our mortgage, well be starting each month down 6k, and our leisure expenses will only go up since well have more free time. But if you expect to have 100k after only five years of serious investing, then youre on the right path. Just be patient. It feels very, VERY slow in the beginning.

Reddit,2024-08-21,"Yes there are opportunities. After I started with the HON DRIP, I thought I was a fing genius during the Dotcom bubble I was heavily into QCOM and after Y2K, I lost over 300K in gains and about 80K in principal by May 2000. I realized I knew very little about stocks and valuation getting caught up in the hoopla. After maxing out my 401K and choosing from blue chips BRK, GE at the time sold when Immmelt became CEO. I made sure that I have both an upside side taking profits and a downside mitigated losses strategies. I also learned how to do DCF, read balance sheets and do DD that is when I started my speculative portfolio. Outside my DD, I also have some set opinions on the stocks I purchased. In the case of FBMETA, I thought they just had too many eyeballs to fail. On AMD, the only competitive to INTC had at the time and knew customers would not lets AMD fail as they need competition as leverage against INTC pricing. When they hire Dr. Su, they began to execute. I also thought INTC strategy of branding device name was genius but it would catch up to them as other would enter the market. Same will happen with NVDA you cannot brand name devices. I was in GE early been when Immelt became CEO, I saw him give a keynote address at a meeting and thought he was slimy. I sold it all and brought back at 6 because I thought the company was worth more apart than together. A long dead money span but it now proving correct.

Reddit,2024-08-21,"After having success with HON, I started to think I knew about stocks. I learned my lesson during the Dotcom bubble. I thought I was a Fing genius with QCOM and few others from 19982000 and all the Y2K hoopla. In midlate Jan, there was like a 10 drop I am a fing genius, rushed in to buy the dip by mid MarchApril, lost 300K and got out it. It taught me a valuable lesson, max out retirement accounts with low cost mutual funds and save 15 cash of yearly income for emergencies, after that than purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends. Then and only then develop a 10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD. For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current. Currently only have 6. One of the most important things in investing not gambling is to have both a downside and upside strategy. For my downside strategy, it is simple if I loses 1520 of my original investment dollars, I am out and ask what did I miss or were there any overriding events war, terrorism, ... I will continue to watch but rarely do I average down as I view this as throwing good money after bad. You need to remember if you lose 50, the stock needs to double just to get to even. For the upside makes sure you have a price target based on your DD and actively monitor, I typically sell 13 or 14 if it grows 2550 no harm in taking profits. If it doubles, I sell half and let the remainder ride as I view these as free shares from my original investment dollars. They become part of hold and forget portfolio that I only tap if I need the money for a big purchase car, home remodel, vacation.... Today, my hold and forget include HON 30, META 19, AMD 2, GE 6 prereverse split, LLY 60 Slow and steady wins the race. For new opportunities, I have two approaches for new opportunities I open my eyes what is trending new stores, news items, etc then I google to see if they make sense to me this is how I found Ulta and OReilly Auto Parts started seeing a lot of new stores made nice profit and got out of Ulta when I saw too many stores I got out too early but I never complain about taking profits. Secondly, I look at the smart money like Bill Gates Breakthrough Energy what are they investing in and then look for similar companies this is how I played the momentum game with QS that I am now out with a nice profit.

As for it being a number to chase, I just know so many people who came to investing late in life i.e. early 40s with little to no savings, so the point I was trying to make is that you do at some point have to consider how much you will need to comfortably retire and do some work to figure out how you are going to get there. anyhow, agree agree agree!",Neutral,0,0.9897791743278503,Reply

To me, this is the kind of thing that I would have a tiny position in and then if it actually starts to get some positive progress that looks like it can be sustained, bump it up from a tiny position to a small or at most medium one and continue to gradually dial up the position if it continues to prove itself. If its a tiny position and it doesnt work out, its a tiny position. I often have 13 of these sort of very earlyearly stage things and some dont work out, some do. So, I wouldnt be against this sort of thing but would really view it very realistically if anything goes wrong with the trial you could find it instadown 2550 one morning if approved, could get a nice boost then do well over time, I dont see it 5xing overnight or something and size the position accordingly.",Negative,-1,0.9910218119621277,Reply

The tools, like Xaslarbet, are increasingly proving their worth, with predictions that consistently outperform human intuition. If youre considering AI as an investment, Id say its a solid opportunity right now.

Starts steadily climbing and you finally have a small profit 6 years later and... the 2008 financial crisis happens. Takes another 5 years to get back to breakeven. So 13 yewrs of negative to flat returns. Now this is disregarding dividend reinvestment because I am supposed to be working now so dont want to calculate it, but long term investing is over decades, not 23 years. Over a LONG ENOUGH time period, the market had always increased. But there have also been whole decades that, looked at alone, have had flat or negative returns. Its just up to your risk tolerance, and what you can afford to lose.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"Yea, first thing I noticed as well. If OPs timeline is only 23 years then yeah it might be stupid to buy the dip, since it can always go lower and the fears are not based on nothing. If the timeline is 20 years, then its never stupid and you should always DCA buy more on dips. Besides, its whatever you call panic. Yea we had steep drops and the news was all over it, but this is not real panic. When shit hits the fan you will lose a lot more then a couple percent. Nobody knows what happens next of course. It might just return and go back up again now, might see a real panic show with everything going down even more and even harder",Negative,-1,0.9980255365371704,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-05,"I am a financial advisor, and while I deal more in diversified portfolios consisting of ETFs and Mutual funds, the following advice holds true for any portfolio its not about timing the market, it is about time in the market. Essentially, timing the market is virtually impossible. You do not know when the worst days are going to come, and you do not know when the best days are going to come. Selling your investments out of fear because of a steep dip in the market can prove to be a costly mistake, because not only will you be realizing those losses, but your running the risk of missing out on potential gains. Using the SP 500 as a benchmark, here is what a 10,000 investment would be worth today if it was first invested in 1994 and you Missed the 30 best days of the SP 500 30,889 Missed the 20 best days of the SP 500 48,874 Missed the 10 best days of the SP 500 83,272 Stayed fully invested all 30 years 181,763 No one knows when the best days are going to happen, but trying to time the market pretty much ensures that you will at least miss out on some of those days. Also, people tend to sell when stocks are low out of fear, and they tend to buy when stocks are high out of greed. That is the exact opposite of what you are supposed to be doing. Now is the time to hold, and buy more since everything is at a discount.",Neutral,0,0.5487065315246582,Reply

Because every share of a company I own are strong companies with solid fundamentals. The case to time the market only works if you have a strong inclination of what will happen shortterm.

Youll sell now when things are already low, because you couldnt sell yesterday, then wait until they recover to yesterdays prices? Like, a stock was 100 on Friday, opens at 80 on Monday. You sell. It closes Monday at 81. It wobbles back and forth from 85ish to 75ish over the next month. When are you buying back? Whats your buy signal? When it hits 100 again? 95? Congrats... you just lost money because you sold at 80 to buy at 95. Are you really gonna say you are able to call the bottom during a recession? Really?

Reddit,2024-08-05,"If you sold at the open, youd have lost out on the recovery through the day and the after close bumps. Dont try to be an idiot and time the markets. The better move is to sell put options for good stocks on discount. Volatility is high so options premiums are up. I sell puts under what the drop prices are and usually just collect premium. If I get assigned then its a stock I wanted at a much lower price than it was most recently. I wait for it to recover a bit and then I sell call options once its been on a run a bit.

Reddit,2024-08-05,"Let me get this straight. You want to sell just half your portfolio based on your wording Im unsure if thats 50k or 100k , trigger a taxable event and attempt to time the market ? For what? Potentially a 1 gain on us staying in or 5001,000? Not sure how you speculated the market will be down 10 in the next two weeks. You do realize the SP 500 is up 9 YTD and historically it averages 10 returns for the entire year, right? A bit of advice. Markets are traditionally very volatile the final 100 days prior to a presidential election. The large price swings are just getting started. and if you cant stomach this at 100k imagine 10x the values to 1 million.",Neutral,0,0.9543068408966064,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-05,"Lets just be honest here, if you cant take the volatility that has happened this last week then perhaps you shouldnt be invested in what you are in. This is not saying sell and buy later I am saying perhaps you have chosen something to risky for you. If your plan is to try to time the market then perhaps we will need to be careful how we are classifying investing or investments with you. Obviously you can pick what you want to do with your money but it sounds like you are either inexperienced or you are in a panic about a paper loss. So much so that you are trying to rationalize how its ok to potentially screw up your taxes to time it correctly in the next 30 days. So again, either you are moving away from your original plan because you cant handle a few days of red, you are panic selling have the wrong investments for your risk or you think you will somehow magically know when to correctly time buy and sells going forward. Lets be real here though, you didnt know to sell a week ago so how will you will know when to get back in at the right time? How long until you are comfortable getting back in? Whats your plan? because currently all you seem to be saying is you will time it, again tho when is the right time...? Lets get more specific what is your plan for the right time, Is it when it gets back to the all time high, up 5 up 15. Will the plan change if you sell it and it goes up tomorrow, then you buy and it goes down? Will you need to try to time it again? How many times going forward are you going to time it? You are proposing a 100k change to your investment so hopefully you fully thought this through. Also do you know your time frame for your investments? Are you needing the money right away? Again then why are you risking your money if its a short time frame? If its a long time frame what would the next week matter in 20 year time frame...? The point I am hopefully making is you dont really have a plan and that perhaps is something you really should figure out before tax and impulse buying and selling. Honestly its something you should have figured out before you put 200k into investments but I guess here we are. Honestly tho its so interesting that everyone on the subs talk about how financial advisors are bad and that you can do everything yourself and be better off, everything is great when its green. You have a week of red and everyone loses there minds. I know people want someone to tell them that everything will be alright but seriously, some of you guys really need to figure out your plans a bit better. I honestly wish you good luck if you are going to try to time the market, hopefully your 100k gamble works out for you but again I dont really think you have al well thought out plan. Its also funny how you start the post but literally saying you hear how everyone says dont time the market, but then immediately say hold my beer while I show you all how to time the market. This is already a long post but seriously if you actually are thinking it will be cheaper in the coming days then why not just buy some more? How terribly to buy some extra at a discounted price if you actually think its a good investment.",Neutral,0,0.99683478474617,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-05,"It depends on so many things, and its not at all as simple to do as you make it sound. First, is your motivation to lock in some amount of gains so you dont feel regretupset if the direction does in fact go where you think it will go? Or is your idea motivated more by the potential opportunity to boost your expected future gains by some amount by rebuying half your portfolio back at a lower cost? Would you reinvest the total proceeds to end up with more shares, Or would you buy the same number of shares you had, only cheaper, and take the difference as cash profit? In other words,, shorting your own portfolio Another POV is, what if you could hypothetically freeze the volatility in your portfolio, aka go delta neutral, no losses no gains, until you feel the outlook is sufficient enough to the upside to unfreeze the volatility? One could hedge the whole or part portfolio with a protective Put option on an index such as QQQ. You wouldnt have to sell anything, so no cap gains tax, and your net unrealized gains would be the same as now until you release the cap. Youd need to have the capital to pay the premium ofc. This is not easy and not advice. Just an example. Further, your current net Unrealized gains need to be considered and weighed against the tax event of just straight selling. Also important to consider is that the Fed does not give AF about market prices going up or down. The SP could grind down to 2,000 between now and December and JPow couldnt care less. Instead, what the Fed hates is volatility. The VIX. Thats when the Fed steps in with their own protective Put. The Fed hates Volatility cuz Wall St. hates unusual Volatility. Last I checked VIX was 2 STDEV 36 above the mean 20. The last time that happened was in 2020 and we got the Fed Put QE, emergency rate cuts. You dont wanna get caught in that and you never know whenif its gonna come. You can get caught off sides and chasing. My point is that these things, and about 20 other possibilities, variables and outcomes covered in other comments, reveal that its not easy at all to do this, effectively, in a Risk Adjusted way that returns you proper gains for the risk youd be taking by messing with any of this. Not to mention tax events. Weve all tried it. Most have learned the hard way its just not worth it. Others succeeded. Luck? Skill? Sophistication? No one can know unless you do this consistently with reproducible outcomes. But there arent enough crashes for that if were calling this that hypothetically. So one needs to practice this whole Buy Low, Sell High thing, and in reverse as well, and get good at it. But what thats called is Trading, not Investing. If you have the time to put into all that entails by opening bell, or already have, godspeed. But without some really careful and thoughtful planning, it can get real ugly real fast, worse than holding. Esp if you dont plan on needing the capital returned anytime soon. Tbh, if its more of a I dont wanna sit on my hands and watch this go down thing, thats understandable. But maybe consider messing with 25 or 10 or 5 just to see how it goes. It helps feed the itch to take action. But obvs with much less risk of getting into a needlessly risky situation. Cheers",Neutral,0,0.9646667540073395,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-05,"This time it isnt about the stock market its about the currency as well. This is the big risk my economics professors discussed with us more than 20 years ago which is a lifetime market risk not a business cycle depending on how it plays out. This time the risk is the end of the US Debt cycle and the US Dollar being the global currency. The issue is the Japanese have been loaning the world Yen in trade for US Dollars meaning they hold a significant amount of US Debt. This currency move up with the JPY getting stronger is causing the carry trade to get unwound. Many may not know this but the reason that MUFG is crashing is that this bank is at the heart of vendor financing programs globally. GE Capitals vendor financing program which included not only GE but Honeywell, and many other large industrials went to MUFG since they are the ones who for years operated the sale of the bonds in Japan. A vendor financing program is one in which there is a payment term of say 1 at 15 days net of 60 days. Behind this is a bond and vendor financing program on the buyer side and a factoring program on the seller side of companies. If this issue can not get stopped, the risk will spread from a market risk to a currency risk where Japan, China, UK and other large holders of US Debt sell the US Bonds and there is no one to buy. If this happens the value of the US Dollar will dramatically drop. Then the risk becomes not a stock market risk but a stock market risk in terms of the US Dollar.

Just realize trading stocks is a two sidedproposition. You have to know when to sell and when to buy, and as a number of posts have mentioned before, that is a tricky proposition as if you miss one of the few big up days which often occur near big down days, then you are out of luck...and getting it right will probably be just that...luck. If you are not a trader with a definable edge this is important and I ended my almost 2 decade professional options trading career when I no longer had a legitimate reason to think I had a definable trading edge over the general market, but an investor, and you cant fight the urge to sell, then your portfolio is either too large for your risk tolerance or is composed of the wrong investment vehicles.

Reddit,2024-08-05,"The time to sell was weeks ago when this started to appear. Sure, you can sell today if you think we are near the bottom the average pull back during a recession is 29. But thats just an average. I actually started doing some buying today unfortunately, not at the lows, but still with the SP down from recent highs by about 10 and Tech down by about 20. Contrary to my wife, I dont try to wait for a bottom to hit. I have my points set based on pull back levels. My experience in waiting for the bottom before I start buying never in the end works as well as setting my points points on the way down. My last notable buying took place in April 16th, but that was in 20 year bonds and the BND bond ETF. My impression then was that rates were spiking and I felt would drop notably later this year which they have certainly started to do. I have been holding a lot of funds in NEAR and BIL for a few months now so am ready to be putting money back into equities. I dont know how far the market will drop. It could hit that 29 level certainly for the Nasdaq, it could go past it, it could fall short of it. I know August is a light month, so low volumes and bigger swings. Its one of my favorite buying months of the year . . . IMO, weve been in a recession for quite a few months or more already.

Reddit,2024-08-05,"To your first point.. A great financial columnist, Scott Burns, argument against timing the market was the fact that market timers often have their money on the sidelines on the big gain days. He had some statistical evidence to support it. And when that occurs, you cause way more damage than just riding out the losses. This is because the combination of all movements gains and losses always work out to be gains over any material time span. I think most people know this, but some lack the discipline to sit idly by and watch their portfolio value drop 10. When I was younger, I tried to time the market because I thought the market was overpriced and poised to pop, and I looked at my account balances way too often. I also paid way more attention to the financial news and the SP movements than I should have. I liquidated my investments to cash. I was so smart!! Of course I was wrong, the market went up, and I waited and waited for the market to slide so that I could reinvest. The right time never came, and I missed out on a lot of gains. I DCAd back into the market over a years time. It was super painful, and I lost a lot of future value. HUGE mistake. HUGE.

Reddit,2024-08-05,"Not the parent commenter, but I assume hes basically looking at trendlines for big funds like VOO, QQQ, VTI, IWY, etc. and using that as a gauge for when to put more money into the market for the long haul. If you look at these funds this morning, you can see they are in a pretty big dip. This holds true whether you look at 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, etc. So if you have cash on hand and are looking to make a long term investment, this is a good time to hop in. Things may dip further over the coming hoursdaysweeks, but history indicates that they will recover to the previous peak about 1015 up from current, as of just a few weeks ago. If you invest now, theres a good chance youll see a 1015 gain before end of the calendar year. Realistically there is always volatility in the Fall, especially during an election year. So dont expect any big wins in the short term unless you are a guru.

But the unfortunate reality is that moments like these are actually pretty damn common, and you just have to ride it out. Itll be fine. My prediction is a flash crash. I suggest everyone in this thread just not look at their portfolios. You shouldnt sell unless you absolutely need the money so badly now that the loss is worth swallowing.

Reddit,2024-08-05,"Market movement is always ahead of the news. Now all you see is negative news and stock is going down. The moment you sell, you are not going to jump back in because its all negative news. Once you are out on the sideline, you will always wait for a lower point to buy back, 1. Stock goes back up higher than your original selling point. You screwed up and refuse to buy back since its already higher. You keep waiting for lower entry and miss the entire run. 2. Stock keeps going down, news still negative, you have no source to determine if it is the bottom or will go down another 5. You have no choice but stay out and keep waiting. There will be a point it hit the lowest and start coming back, you are used to it go dead cat bounce and keep crashing down. But this time it didnt go down and up like a rocket, you of course missed it and start debating if it is over or just another bull trap. News still lag behind, negative everywhere. You keep waiting and waiting for more negative until it almost back to the price when you sold. You buy back and wasted the entire time. People didnt even touch their stock sitting at the same position. So if you set a rule to buy back when break even, you cant make gains. because condition 1 you lose, condition 2 you break even. If you set a rule to only buy back if 10 or 20 down, the more greedy you are the more risk you are taking if the stock never go down that much and the buy back never triggered, you miss the entire run up. You make 25 gain if you wait for 20 down to buy back. If it happens, you make 25, if it didnt happen, all it take is once and your loss is infinite because you never buy back. So repeatedly betting big down to buy back is a lose play in long run. So what happens is exactly like casino, every time you make a safer small bet to buy back to with only a small down. You did it 10 times and thought you beat the system. You are winning so you will never quit, until one day stock fake down and keeping going up never come back, and you are still waiting for a lower entry after 5 years because you refuse to accept the reality. Plus sitting in IVV VOO will get you dividend, you missed that for years as well. Timing market is exactly like gambling. I learnt from 20212022. There always will be casino winners and day traders flash their winning money and selling courses. But 99 other losers take their losses quietly and go back to regular jobs.

Reddit,2024-08-05,"While this thought of mine may be a bit conspiratorial, it may also be in complete alignment with regular hedge fund strategy. Though being I would guess that Buffett employs on his investment team not just risk analysts with broad knowledge on global affairs and political risk, but at least one if not more specialists on Israel specifically. I would assume not just exmilitary, but Israeli exmilitary specialists who have their ear to the ground on happenings within the Israeli military intelligence apparatus to the greatest extent allowed for by insider trading laws. In other words, Im also saying my abovedescribed theory is a description of strategy allowed for by US laws. Buffetts risk department was likely busy both with creating their recommendations on in the event of escalations in ME conflict what companies would take the greatest hit in the event of escalations and once identified, what portion of holdings would they recommend to liquidate in case of an escalation or escalations of hostilities. Once that work is complete, all eyes in the risk dept. were focused on the Israeli risk specialists, who were likely providing the greater risk team with possible scenarios so the risk team could run Monte Carlo analyses and other statistical models on various dependent and independent variables. If this makes sense so far, then it is a virtual 100 certainty that the assassination of one of the leaders of Hamas in Iran would be one of the independent variables that would score high on correlation visavis an escalation in hostilities. My point, in general, is I would guess that the day the Hamas leader was killed in Iran was a very busy day at Buffetts investment team office. As well as at most if not all hedge funds for that matter. A hedge fund without a highranking Israeli exmilitary turned high paid analyst is probably virtually unheard of these days since last October.",Neutral,0,0.9999898672103882,Reply

Open AIs ChatGPT has parameter counts rumored to be in the trillions and llama 3.1 has around 400 billion parameters. Even with this vast difference in size Im looking at this like brain power llama is competing quite well because they found that if they just spend way more time training the model it magnifies its ability. I think these findings are probably having an effect on the development of GPT5 or whatever they plan to name it.

Reddit,2024-10-27,Everything youve written is pretty much spot on. Not sure about the downvotes either. Here are some answers The most common purpose of an emergency fund is to cover your personal expenses in the event your main source of income suddenly goes to zero. The recommended 36 months should depend on the expected time for you to secure a new job. For example if you are a fast food worker it may be shorter vs. an executiveCEO it may be longer. It will also depend on the job market in your industry. One risk is that the sudden loss in income can come during a recession when many others are also looking for employment. In this case it may take longer to find another job. The US would pretty much need to default on their debt for SPAXX to tank. Very low likelihood in the next 10 years and beyond. This is fine to invest in as you say you would then only need to cover the 13 business days for the money to transfer to your checking account.

Additionally, while many conflate items like repairing a car and replacing a hot water heater with using emergency funds, its often because people forget to plan for semi regular expenses rather than a true emergency. For example, a tree falling through your roof is an emergency. A 30 year old roof resulting in leaks and a burst pipe is a maintenance costs you need to plan for.

Reddit,2024-10-27,"The whole idea of recommending a 3 month worth of emergency funds is just an estimate of how much a person would need for any emergency situations or contingencies. This is just like keeping some money aside for any unforeseen expense say you have an accident or say your refrigerator broke down or you have a major car repair to deal with or a health emergency. I think you did not understand this basic purpose of emergency fund. The emergency fund is not intended to earn good interest or return, so thats not a consideration. If you still want to put it in highinterest earning accounts, good for you, but thats not the objective. I agree with your point about having credit card to cover emergecies but thats also how people get in to a debt trap I dont need to explain this you know it. Lastly for some people I understand building 36 months emergency fund is difficult. For example for someone earning 5000 a month and having 3000 a month expenses, the suggested emergency fund would be in the range of 9000 to 18000. Saving 10,000 or more is not easy in the context of high inflation and lifestyle expenses we have today. So the way to get to atleast 9000 is to set aside regular sums every week say put in 200 a week and by end of the year you will reach the 10000 mark. Its not like one day you wake and say I will put 10k in emegency fund, its a slow process.

But at the end of each month most of that is gone. But every once in while something happens and you need more money. Credit cards and personal loans are expensive due to high interest. A savings account is cheeper. But is dont have to be in a bank. You could set up a taxable account at a brokerage such as fidelity. They offer money market cash accounts. so you can put a few months to a full your of money in it with decent interest to cover unexpected cash needs. And they can issue you a debit card to give your easy access to the money. But you do have to pay taxes on the interest. If the interest in your money market account gets high you start being stocks or funds that either dont pay a dividend or pay a very small dividend. like amazon or the SP00 index fund like VOO. You could save several years or more of money this way with minimal to no aditiaional tax. And if thinks go well you get some capital gains which grows your savings even more with minimal or no tax. To accesss this savings you would have to enter sell order to sell some stocks or some of the fund. This at a minimum will fake a few days or sometimes about a week. Once complete the money will be in your cash account. The size of the each or long term savings is up to you. I personally have about 6 months of cash on hand and currently have about 3 years in stocks that dont pay a dividend. Now there is one other thing you can do with a taxable account. Build a living income fund or fire account.Financial Independence Retire Early. In this portion of the account you can invest ins stock or ETF that pay a higher dividend than money market account. Depending on your risk tolerant you can get a dividend yield of up to 10.

Reddit,2024-10-27,"The 36 months of expenses in an emergency fund thing is basic advice intended for people who are not particularly financial savvy and need things stated in extremely simple terms. Since this is rinvesting, this deserves a more nuanced discussion than most of the replies youve received so far have contributed. We should be able to understand things here like opportunity cost, max historic drawdowns of asset classes, etc.. We also should have a good understanding of our actual income and expenses, what the risks are to our income sources, what the value of and risks to our assets are, what expenses can be adjustedeliminated over time in the case of a long term loss of income, etc.. I personally regret having followed the 36 months advice too literally when younger. It was money I never needed and never came close to needing and wouldve grown to much greater levels had I invested it instead. People will respond that I was just lucky and what if, etc., but really it just turns out that in those downtimes, you adapt and adjust and find solutions. Besides myself, I cannot think of any partner, friend, family member, or coworker that I am aware of a situation where they ever needed six months of living expenses within 13 days. Never. I cant even imagine a scenario where that would happen. All of this gets down to specifics of your personal finances and situation, so no blanket statement exists, but I dont think it is hard constructing an investment portfolio for an emergency fund that properly balances risk and return, perhaps bootstrapping it with some percentage of buffer above historic max drawdown for that asset allocation. The fun thing is watching it grow over the years past that buffered amount and beyond, eventually getting to the point where even a historic market crash would leave you better off than if you had played it safe by stashing it in a low percentage rate bank account.",Neutral,0,0.9718104004859924,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-27,Depends how familiar you are with the market. Yeah stocks can tank but if youre properly diversified then you arent going to suffer like people describe. And its not hard to use a credit card to cover immediate issues and then liquidate x amount of stocks to cover that within a week or month. Vs keeping that money permanently out of the market. If youre in a position where your investments cant cover an emergency anyway then all this is moot. I dont recommend using a margin loan to most people but if you have the room and are comfortable with that level of risk its fine. If I have 50k in assets and I take out a 5k loan Im not getting margin called even on a 50 overnight drop. Which also wouldnt happen. But if you really want to fear the worst I guess you can think like that. Youre naively sacrificing long term wealth to have a permanent tail risk cover. And at that point you might as well take out that margin loan and use options to secure any downside protection in case on a fall in the meantime.,Neutral,0,0.7046718597412109,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-27,"The idea here isnt to run a razor thin margin. If youre going to take a margin loan you need to be able to ride out volatility. If you cant do that then its a bad idea. Theres risks either way. Either you risk not having as much growth or you risk bad downside timing and tail risk. Not everyone has the same risk tolerance. I would just as well use my credit card and pay the interest on that for a couple months if I had to. Youre basically saying that these loans are bad to take because a black swan event could mess you up financially. But it will do that regardless. The difference is that youre not taking that margin loan long term. Where as the goal would be to keep it in that hysa for at long as possible. At the end of the day is just about risk tolerance. I dont recommend you take a margin loan for any reason. But if youre educated on it and comfortable with the risk reward for doing so, emergency or not, go for it. Theres a lot of different ways to handle the same problem. I use a credit card. Then pull from my brokerage to cover if necessary. Edit I will add that market crashes dont just appear. They have indicators and warnings leading up to them. At had a ton of news coming out about China before it hit. Gfc had a LOT of indicators that the housing bubble was prime for a shit storm. Dot Com bubble had a mountain of red flags. But youre right the average investor isnt looking for these things or trying to protect against them. And yeah all this is easy to say in hindsight.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"If I were to be honest I would say that trying to follow other investors has cost me more money than it has made me. If you make an investment you have to know why, so that when the situation changes, you know if you should hold or sell. Famous investors usually dont tell you the whole story, and often have different incentives. Take Buffetts investment in Coke for example. He first made this in the 1980s and kept his buying secret until he amassed a huge position. It went up nearly 10x in the subsequent years and was one of his most successful investments and he said all kinds of great things about it like it being the strongest franchise in the world. And he is famous for holding stocks forever and holds it to this day. However if you invested in Coke a few years after he did, you would have underperformed the market for 20 years. Buffett had already made his money, and the increasing dividends paid by Coke helps his insurance companies in specific ways that do not apply to average investors.",Positive,1,0.9937870502471924,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-18,"I see that you added a few new questions so lets go through those If a share can be lent out multiple times doesnt that mean the value is inflated? Not necessarily. It will place some downward pressure on a stock. In a public market, the stock price will also adjust to what is perceived as fair value. There is an old maxim that in the short run, the market is a voting machine which discusses the value of the stock based on the thencurrent markets future expectation of the value of a company. The quote come from Benjamin Graham and one of his books is suggested in the wiki. If I have a fraction of a share do I actually have a claim to the share? Yes its a contractual claim between yourself and the broker. That is because the broker offers fractional shares services for equities. However that said if a longterm investor cannot afford the funds for whole shares its usually simpler to use mutual funds which transact in dollar and penny increments so that fractional shares are irrelevant and contributions to the fund can be done anytime regardless of share price. What are you really paying for if a broker can resell the same security multiple times? A broker cannot resell multiple times. Thats not how share lending works. In a security lending program a broker is legally required to put up cash collateral everytime the share is borrowed. Lets take for example the GME that you mentioned. The stock is currently considered HTB or hard to borrow at many brokers. So if I shorted 1 share of GME for 21. I will receive 21 in proceeds from my broker. But because its HTB there is a daily borrow fee that is accrued that I have to pay to the broker. The 21 in proceeds is goes into margin credit balance. And if the price of GME goes to 22, I now also have a margin fee of 1. The share that I borrow would have come from the brokers security lending desk. And some brokers will split the lending fee with the customer lent the share. The counterparty to my short sale who bought the 1 share can then lend the share again and the process repeats itself. Security lending is just one small component of the revenue stream that a broker can receive. What do you mean by what are you really paying for running a brokerage business means having employees, technology, etc. etc. As a brokerage customer you are paying the broker for custody services, bookeeping, customer services, access to the capital markets, etc. etc. In the US the services that a retail investor receives from a broker are incredibly high relative to the fees. Brokers in the US are very competitive and the access to the capital markers for investors are easier and more affordable than in previous decades. For example when I first started trading and investing the average transaction cost was 49 per trade today there is 0 commissions and exchange fees are literally pennies per transaction. Also data was not free getting realtime data meant paying a monthly fee. Also odd lot trading meant an extra commission brokerage systems in the past mostly support whole lots a lot is 100 shares. If someone wanted to buy only 10 whole shares a different exchange mechanism was required and that usually meant an extra commission. Also because the cost for a broker to support accounts was higher brokers used to have account minimums usually 2k iirc.",Positive,1,0.9999421238899231,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-18,ok let take a step back. I assume you are in the US based on your questions. In the US brokerage accounts are not at a bank. Banks and brokers are different type of financial institutions. Banks are a type of depository and work very differently than brokerages. If you are asking about a retirement account it is always cash based. By law brokers are not permitted to extend credit to a retirement account I.e no regt margin. A brokerage account retirement or otherwise is never on the books of a broker. So if a broker becomes insolvent the account simply transfers to another broker. That is one of the roles of the SIPC they will ensure that the brokerage accounts ar protected. All the assets in the accounts continue to belong to the account holder. Brokerage insolvency are exceeding rare. And account holders losing money from a brokerage insolvency I am only aware of one or two which are futures brokers where there was widespread fraud. Even when FTX failed from huge crypto fraud account holders in the stock brokerage portion of FTX did not lose value in their accounts. Brokerage accounts are incredibly well regulated. Even if securities in an account is lent out which I believe is your concern by law the lent securities must be pledged in cash so a broker going bankrupt would not cause account holders to lose money. There would need to be a catastrophic failure in the checks and balances of a brokerage for account holders to be adversely impacted. fwiw Where are you getting your information? There is so much wrong about how you think investing and brokerages work.,Neutral,0,0.9029961824417114,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-18,The reason why people lost value in their retirement accounts was because people were over invested in the capital markets. Or that they had concentration risk that can happen.

For example some people may have overly concentrated their retirement into one company stock or only in equities. During the 2008 GFC equities lost a lot of value.

Reddit,2024-10-18,"Thanks for those points. The reason Im looking at AVUVAVGVCGGO are because they are actively managed, global funds that should have lowish correlation. I started investing about 3 years ago learning about the passive indexing that you reference, which I think is why the market seems so overpriced. I guess Boggling with actively managed funds feels less risky. Also, I dont really see the risk in splitting equally between growth value. I used to hold total market indexes and then do SCV tilts, which actually seems more risky to me, because I was betting that SCV would outperform. Since I realistically dont know what will outperform market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent kind of thing I makes sense in my weird mind to hold LCG SCV in equal proportions and rebalance with contributions. One could even use VT to keep exposure to other areas of the market in a portfolio like VT 20 CGGO 40 AVUV 20 AVDV 10 AVES 10 CGGO has a high expense ratio, but its a true growth fund and still has a PE ratio below 30. A fund like VOO seems to really be a large cap blend fund. A true growth index like VUG has a PE ratio in the 40s and its just hard to buy that. Although now Im seeing that according to stock analysis, SCHG has a PE ratio of 12, which sounds like a mistake... I agree that you can consistently make good plays with a small portion of your portfolio, but it also seems that combining strategies can be like shooting yourself in the foot at times. From what I gather, the way you accumulate wealth in a portfolio like I have illustrated above is by rebalancing your set percentages. Maybe the answer is to use different accounts for different strategiesgoals? For instance, another accumulation portfolio might be highly leveraged with things like 3x SP 500, 3x long treasuries and managed futures contracts. Even just maintaining a set allocation, the fluctuations in the marketinterest rate cycles will always tell you what you need to buy. Nothing is wrong with VTIVXUS, its just that Im open to a little more volatility and perhaps higher returns by favoring a portfolio of essentially polar opposites, if that makes sense. Id be interested to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",Neutral,0,0.9936874508857727,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-14,"Actually, I take the bond comment back if you simply want to get used to seeing them in a portfolio and how they interact with equities. Might make it easier to increase as time goes by too. Regarding international equities, they are roughly 40 of market cap so the better question to ask yourself is why exclude them? They offer diversification, the only free lunch in investing, and there are plenty of products you probably own that arent made in the USA. Why limit your exposure, and possibly risk, to one single country over a 60 year investment horizon? Material I would also personally combine your large cap growth with total stock market since they have a pretty similar exposure. Rapid growth is an interesting term to use since theres no way to guarantee rapid growth from one sector to happen. I would think more about dividend investing in a taxable brokerage too theres a good chance youd be paying more in taxes than something that wasnt spitting out as many dividends. Lastly, small cap would be a good hedge against large cap stocks as well and might improve overall returns if you have the conviction to stick with it and it makes up more than 15 or 20 of your US equities since anything less wont move the needle too much. I would make sure it either tracks the SP SmallCap 600 Value Index, or is an actively managed but well constructed fund such as the AVUV ETF from Avantis.",Neutral,0,0.9489768743515015,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-12,"Youre kind of looking at it backwards, throwing money at investments and wondering when you can use the money instead of saving for specific goals and investing appropriately based on the timeline of those goals. Equities being long term investments is based on the value increasing on average if youre invested broadly enough, but volatility means it wont necessarily be worthwhile in the short term. If youre saving for shorter term goals, including approaching retirement, you want to shift the money into investments that you know will be worthwhile in that time frame. Stuff with little to no volatility like treasuries and bonds. Everyone contributes a bit at a time toward savings for future goals if they have any savings at all, its like a bill for a cost you havent had to pay yet. Most people will have multiple goals with different time frames, so theyll have a mix of different types of assets. Freeing up money when its time might look like cashing out because youre reducing your total so youll most likely be selling volatile assets to bring your allocation back in line. I think a better way to look at it is that your fixed income assets are like a buffer. Years before retirement you sold some stock and that locked in the gains youd had so far. You put it in bonds which have lower growth but cant lose value like stocks.

So, you should wait 20 years to receive 7,300 to maximize the present value at a 5 discount rate. Things to consider A higher discount rate leads to a smaller optimal N. Money today is more valuable due to higher opportunity cost. A lower discount rate results in a larger optimal N. Youre willing to wait longer because the opportunity cost is lower.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"My advice is to invest in an ETF that pays a dividend. In my accoun I have FAAGIX 5 yield in gov and corporate bonds. PFFD 6, Coperagte divides payed out monthly. And I am considering BIZD or PBDC both have a yield of about 10 operate dividends. If investing in an ETF you will pay taxes on the dividends but If you keep the yield at about 5 the tax is going to similar to the tax on your HYSA right now. At a 10 yield would add about another 5000 to yourtaxes. This will not likely have a major impact on your taxes. The biggest risk fro investing in EFTs like this Occurs when you have to sell share if you need more than the yearly dividend. But the share price only varies by about 5 from it average or less. So if you timing is bad you probably wont loose a lot.. The only other risk is loss of dividends. These ETF invest in many companies so if only one goes Bad it isnt going to have a noticeable impact. Most of the time there is just a slow change in dividend pay out over time. The most challenging year for all of these dividends 2as 2020 due to the pandemic. All continued to pay the dividend. you could invest the entire 100K into these funds in Fidelity or Schwab account and then have the dividend About 5,000 to 10000 go into a cash account that would earn an interest of about 4 O you can leave much of the money as cash earning about the same as a HYSA with l a lesser amount in the ETFs, you could keep the dividends as cash or reinvest them in the ETF to increase the dividend. Since you are expected college expenses for thee next few yours this is probably thee best option for now. However after that you could continue the dividend income to refill the cash and reinvest dividends to grow the dividend.s build the dividend to help cover you in the event of a job loss If you build the dividnend yearly income you could get 24000 a year social security level. or more. possibly enough to over all or most of your living expenses.

So I typically only care about the actual truth in the numbers over fake emotional hooblah when it comes to investmentsmoney generally. 2. For your kids the best thing for school would have been 529 plans. Not a HYSA. Could have saved a ton on taxes and even invested in whatever you wanted to maximize returns. Also, the actual best thing to do is to male sure they are prepped for the SATACT and apply for grants and scholarships. Take honors classes for college credit etc. That makes more sense than anything else when it comes to school. Also, go to an in decent in state school 98 of the time over paying double to go to nonivy league level school and paying double for little to no extra benefit to make it even worth it. 3. Stop freaking panicking over HYSA rates. They were never intended to be high interest vehicles and likely just return to 12 vehicles again over the years. Fed rates slowly cut over time anyway. If you want higher returns you put it on the market and be willing to wait it out.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"Hi uBytchYouThought, I have seen several of your comments on other posts and appreciate your view point. You comments here are pretty close to what my goal has been, though I have probably gone about it slightly different. The comments to this post has also proven to be very helpful and educational. In many ways, providing the exactly the information I was hoping to learn. Anyway... I will at least respond to your points below 1. That was exactly my thought. I dont like debt, but quickly realized I could easily earn more with the I would put on the mortgage then I would save by reducing interest. That is when I started setting aside extra income. This was about 4 years ago. God has bless us with the ability to double my income single income home and have some extra unexpected bonuses. This is where 120K of the 150 came from, we already had the emergency fund. 2. There is a reason I didnt invest in 529 plans for the kids. For most of our lives we didnt have extra to put in them. As a single family home with five kids, we have had to be frugal to get where we are. My plan was to increase my income to help directly bank role education at least help when the kids were college age. So far that has worked. Give my sons grades and test scores he will have significant scholarships, I am hoping to only need to split 1520K a year with him. We are looking at private christian university LeTourneau due to the quality of education and campus environment. It also aligns with our values. It is more expensive than a local state school, but we believe it is worth it. 3. I have certainly seen people freak out over HYSA rates. That isnt what I am doing. I dont even go chase rates as I know they fluctuate often. I now have saving to cover the remainder of our mortgage and was hoping there were ways to keep it earning a little more than a savings account. In other words, as a relative novice, I was assuming there are better options that I didnt know about... and I have learned about a lot of them in this thread... such as tax advantaged VUSXX or SGOV. With this knowledge I will likely move into a brokerage account where I can keep the same or slightly better yield with state tax savings and an easy path to slowly move into longer term investments such as VTI as I am able to add cash. 3.5 To your point of over blowing the risk of the market... I try not to. I actually usually set at a higher risk posture since I recognize the market goes down and back up again. To your point of being well off... I am blessed. Much of this blessing has been realized in the last five years or so. I am also disciplined. My 401K just passed 1M this year, so yes... I am well on my way to a happy retirement. I realized I didnt know as much about managing and investing in a taxable account, which I would like to learn now that I have... and Lord willing will continue to have... increased expendable income. So, that was more of a book than I planned. In short, I am trying to do exactly what you are recommending... not getting over focused on HYSA or fearful of the market so I can move extra savings that I have into a slightly higher risk position to earn more prior to potentially needing to pull from it to help my kids with schooling or use it in an emergency to cover our mortgage.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"Ah, perhaps I should clarify a few things. The first, this is just one persons opinion and when it comes to personal finances you can feel free to say hey ubytchyouthought, yours stinks and I wouldnt lose a wink of sleep and completely understand. Two, I rushed that comment as evident by typos and what not. Also 1. Yeah, I dont really care for debt either, but 2.8 is 2.8 and I personally just let the math overrule my feelings. Some folks are more comfortable even if it was 2.8 the fact that it had debt attached many folks would still want to prioritize paying it off anyway, because its the fact that it is debt at all and not about math. So, you have to make the decision whether math or the feeling is more important to you. You know my choice. 2. I wasnt judging you for not doing 529s. Most people dont and in fact, most people would have a hard time paying for their kids school at all period. This is how my parents were. I ended up taking the honors classes and getting decent scores on ACT etc sports scholarship etc. Point is do what you can not a judgement or explanation needed as to why you didnt do something. If you can afford to move money there cool, but if not raising your kids well is worth way more and they understand and will figure it out either way. 3. Yeah, I mentioned treasury funds in my original comment which is exactly what SGOV and VUSSX is. Basically same rates overall as hysas just marginally higher to the point of being Basically around the same. I have part of my savings in USFR, but honestly moved it anyway to a hysa at 5.0 since having instant access is just nice and the difference doesnt matter much at all to me. 3.5 Naw, I understand the pressure of getting scared by the market. I just realize its way scarier to not have enough for retirement and not have retired early. The fact of the matter is, theres nothing to be scared of, because the moment the market doesnt recover is the moment your money is worthless anyway and you should more focused surviving a literal apocalypse no exaggeration rather worrying about worthless money. So in other words, its either you make out ahead or youre basically dead or enslaved anyway. Oh, looks like youre on the road to FIRE as well. Congrats! Yeah, for me, my emergency fund a years worth of expenses basically covers me so I dont worry about my long term money. If you want you could pay off the house.

Reddit,2024-10-06,"As a 14yearold investor, youre already off to a great start! Its awesome that youre thinking about investing strategies at your age. Here are some thoughts on your options 1. VOO VXUS This is a solid, diversified foundation. VOO gives you broad US market exposure, while VXUS adds international diversification. For many investors, this combo is enough. 2. Adding VGT While it would increase your tech exposure, its worth noting that VOO is already techheavy. Adding VGT might lead to overconcentration in one sector. 3. Individual stocks LMT, RTX At your current investment level, individual stocks might introduce unnecessary risk. Theyre less diversified than index funds. Regarding diversification vs. consolidation With smaller amounts, keeping it simple with 12 broad funds like your VOOVXUS combo is often recommended. Its easier to manage and still gives you good diversification. As your portfolio grows, you can consider adding more specific sectors or individual stocks if you want. My advice At this stage, stick with VOO and VXUS. Focus on consistently adding to these positions over time. This approach gives you a diversified base to build upon as you learn more and your portfolio grows. Remember, the most important things right now are 1. Developing good savinginvesting habits 2. Learning about investing 3. Giving your investments time to grow One last point to consider Given your young age, you might want to lean more towards growth investing rather than dividendfocused strategies. Growth stocks have the potential for higher returns over the long term, which could be beneficial given your long investment horizon. Your current VOO VXUS combination actually aligns well with this growthoriented approach.

Which means buy smaller chunks each month for the next forseeable future and the laddering strategy will pay off over time. You could contribute a smaller amount to VGT but tech, albeit a secular growth sector with great runway, is over valued valuation wise because its so popular and overbought and if it drops you will see volatility in your values. Investing in individual stocks is useful if you have some intrinsic knowledge about the business, the company is in , or rhe stocks value ie its super undervalued.

Reddit,2024-10-04,"Theres a lot of private REIT offerings that often label themselves as some variation of a unique opportunity previously only available to rich people! But they generally wind up being worse than a REIT and also more complex to own, are illiquid entirely illiquid or limited opportunities to sell and some in the past have gated withdrawals for temporary periods. This seems like it framed itself differently but seems very gimmicky in terms of the kind of things you got and has the same core issues limited liquidity, etc. Never heard of the company mentioned but crowdfunding, EREITs which feel like what were previously nontraded REITs an asset class that lead to a lot of complaints over the years in a different wrapper, stuff like that I just really dont recommend. Edit The site is kind of underwhelming. It focuses on the message which is nice but who is running the operation and what is their background? I see some people listed but no biographybackground. It shows the number of properties it owns in Atlanta but no examples that I can see. Apparently this is some sort of RegA nontraded REIT theres just very little information from an investment standpoint on the website, which is focused entirely on the message really. Id have to really go through filings to try to have a better understanding of the investment yes the message is nice but what do these houses look like? who is running this and what kind of qualifications do they have? the CEO of this was apparently previously CEO of some sort of automotive company?, which imo shouldnt have to be done. What are the specifics of withdrawals, given limited liquidity? Is there the ability to gate withdrawals? It doesnt really say on the website. Looking at one of the filing offerings, theres a long list of risks including our manager and its affiliates have no prior experience managing a portfolio of assets to comply with REIT requirements and detailed conflicts of interest between the manager and the sponsor. Edit finally found it after looking through filings. They intend to limit the number of units to be able to be redeemed during any calendar year to 5 of the weighted average number of units outstanding during the prior year. The manager can gate withdrawals at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason. Theres a lot of other specifics, but its like all the other nontraded REITs yes there is quarterly liquidity, but not if a lot of people try to redeem at once. Again, not really familiar with this beyond just starting to look through filings, but I just think that anything investmentwise needs to have more information than this does on its website. These kinds of offerings sell themselves very basically on their websites but imo theres a lot more to it I mean, just looking at one of the offering filings its nearly 100 pages and theres a lot of noteworthy thingsrisksconsiderations on these filings that should be under an FAQ section on the website itself, not something that people have to go through a filing to find when considering this sort of investment.",Neutral,0,0.9998051524162292,Reply

Sometimes they receive the money monthly or yearly. One way of maximizing these payments is to place the chunk the corpus of money in dividendyielding stocks or ETFs. That is one reason some people like them. It is a selfgoverning way of keeping a beneficiary on a budget. The corpus is never touched by the beneficiary.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"When you say income, do you mean taking the money to pay bills or whatever? It never makes sense to take income from the investments while simultaneously contributing to those investments from your actual income from working. Dividends are capital gains, both are gains from investments, and both are taxed either at your income tax rate, or your ltcg rate. The only difference is in choosing when and how much gains you realize. Investing is a complex topic, so its important to be accurate with the terms you use. In asset allocation, fixed income means stuff like bonds, buying debt so you get the interest and theres little to no risk on the principal. The opposite of fixed income is often referred to as growth, but it just means equities. Thats completely unrelated to growth value, which refers to what a company does with excess revenue. Schd holds equities, so its growth as far as growth vs fixed income. On the value factor scale within equities, dividend paying companies tend to occupy the value side of the spectrum, but theyre still equities with all the risks that entails, and its not comperable fixed income investments. You want growthequities for money you can leave invested long enough to mitigate volatility risk, and fixed income when you are approaching needing to be able to spend the money youve saved. Shifting from growth to fixed income, selling equities to buy bonds, is locking in the gains youve already had ahead of your need to actually spent the money so you arent risking loss due to volatility right when you need it.",Neutral,0,0.9998836517333984,Reply

You have a 100k position in company A, it pays 3 yield.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"There are two issues with this. Some investment strategies, like dividend investing, are more a form of psychological selftrickery than an actual way to avoid psychological mistakes. If dividends lead someone to hold a falling stock for longer than it is rational because its still paying out the dividends or I cant sell, my yield on cost is really high, theyre making bad financial decisions based on factors that do not matter. Similarly, people can get hung up on number of shares held as a false indicator of a growing position. The biggest one, of course, is that cash hitting your account means that youve made money, or that you increased your net worth. They would be tricking themselves into doing a generally good thing, holding shares instead of churning, but the tricking could itself produce bad results by creating excessive focus on something that doesnt matter. Second, I wonder how true it is that these strategies actually produce the behaviours that get touted as benefits. Do we know that dividend investors react less fearfully to market downturns? What about dividend cuts? People say its true, but is it? Any look at rdividends shows the usual amount of nervousness found in investing subs around share price and future performance. If a strategy is presented as more appropriate for less secure investors, its only logical that we would want to know if it actually does what people say it does. Finally, when we say that there are different strategies for investing, we have to set a bar that these strategies are at least equivalent, in that theyre designed to produce as much riskadjusted return as possible. If someone is only investing in dividend payers because of wrongheaded ideas, theyre taking more single company risk for possibly smaller returns looking at you, KO and JNJ investors.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"I agree that dividends are an indirect way to gain exposure to the profitability, conservative asset growth, and value factors. But there are some reasons why dividends are a good means to do this 1. Funds that track factors usually either have higher fees than dividend index funds, or they do a poor job at tracking factors. For example both Fidelity and Vanguards Small cap value funds had 2 well known meme stocks as their biggest holdings during the 20202021 trend companies that were unprofitable and trading at very high valuations. Finding a fund with both a solid methodology and low fees is exceedingly difficult. As a result, it is unlikely investors will achieve the same level of excess returns that academic literature suggests. 2. Dividends provide a psychological benefit that can help investors stay the course during market turbulence. Even if a proper value investing approach provides slightly higher returns, if dividends help prevent an investor from selling off during a crashbecause the cash flow provides comfort, it can enhance actual returns. 3. The value premium tends to lead to investing in companies with high capital requirements, due to its reliance on book value. This leads value funds to firms with low return on invested capital. Dividend strategies, however, mostly track the profitability factorbecause generally, only profitable companies pay dividends. There is a lot of argument to be made that companies with high return on invested capital perform better.",Negative,-1,0.544510006904602,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"Reinvesting dividends is critical. When a company pays a dividend, that money is no longer available to the company to fund future growth but, on the other hand, you have a share of the profits today. If a company doesnt pay dividends, on the other hand, the profits are retained and, in essence, reinvested in the company to theoretically fund future growth. As an investor, reinvesting dividends equalizes this to some degree. Youre not actually giving money back to the company unless you have a DRIP with the company itself, which are less and less common but you are increasing the number of shares you own essentially for free. Check out some online DRIP calculators to see the difference in total returns with dividends reinvested vs without. Its astronomical.",Neutral,0,0.9997199177742004,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"As are capital gains. The difference is when those taxes are due When you receive a dividend you pay taxes on that income in the year the dividend is paid, but capital gains only occur when shares are sold. Typically, stocks with higher dividend payouts see their share prices grow more slowly so it roughly evens out in the end. So youd have to pay taxes on something that youve reinvested ALA dont have the proceeds to pay the taxes anymore. This is a fair point at least in theory. Since you have to pay tax on the dividends each year, you have less money available to invest. If the tax on a 300 dividend to use OPs example is making or breaking you, though, perhaps you need to reexamine your broader financial picture. The uncertainty of future tax law also must be considered when dealing with capital gains.

Some people act like dividend reinvesting is basically some kind of hack in the system, like its this one secret move that shortcircuits normal investing. Thats why you get arguments around dividend snowballs through reinvestment, when really, all it does is compouding the number of shares held. As for the dividends outperform in a drawdown, one thing Ive noticed is that older, more dividendobsessed people are likely traumatized in their financial thinking by the 08 crisis, which is understandable psychologically, but I think it leads into an excessively low risk tolerance and also a fetishization of cold hard cash over paper gains. Ive seen so often the argument that dividends pay me back, growth companies can go to 0, which to me reads as a perspective skewed by the GFC. It implies that companies can go to 0 unexpectedly which is very rare, and that it happens often enough that growth investing becomes inherently risky. Neither of these things is true at the market level, but it intuitively seems convincing that dividends are better if the comparables are holding to 0 while receiving dividends vs holding to 0 and not receiving dividends. Its just that those scenarios are meaningless, the key is to not hold to 0. Its like saying that your hat has a drawstring so that if you fall off a cliff, at least you dont lose your hat. Just dont fall off a cliff! The real cost of things like dividend investing is opportunity cost. People are pacified by dividends hitting their accounts, but theyre not calculating potential lost returns. You see it anytime someone brags about receiving dividends from CocaCola or Johnson Johnson, or a CC yield fund, or whatever. The psychological satisfaction becomes a selfimposed veil. Theres one comment in this thread by someone who invests in their utilities so that they can pay their bills with the dividends. That is the definition of opportunity cost, theyre locking probably 2030 times the amount of their bills into lowreturn companies, just for the psychological satisfaction of paying their bills with dividends.",Neutral,0,0.9981586337089539,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-24,"Congrats on building such a strong financial foundation and the exciting news about expecting a baby! Its great that youve been maxing out your HSA and thinking ahead about how your strategy should evolve with more medical expenses on the horizon. First, its worth weighing the benefits of staying on a highdeductible health plan HDHP versus switching to a plan that might offer better coverage for a growing family. If you anticipate higher healthcare costs with a baby, a traditional plan with lower outofpocket costs might be more practical. However, youll lose the ability to contribute to your HSA, as you mentioned. Your current HSA balance of 40k is a fantastic cushion, especially since it will continue to grow taxfree. One option could be to keep paying for smaller expenses outofpocket as you have been, while saving the HSA for larger medical expenses or longterm retirement healthcare costs. Another approach would be to start using the HSA for qualified medical expenses once your family grows and healthcare costs increase, while letting the remaining balance continue to grow taxfree for retirement. It sounds like youve already done the heavy lifting with your other retirement accounts and emergency funds, so continuing to max out your HSA until you possibly switch plans could be a smart move. And even if you do stop contributing, that 40k will still serve you well over time. For health insurance choices, its all about finding the right balance between premiums, outofpocket costs, and what will give you peace of mind for your family. Id say focus on what gives you the best coverage for your needs now, knowing youve already set yourself up for success with your HSA.",Positive,1,0.9999310970306396,Reply

China has high quality electronic vehicles and solar technology that they build way cheaper than those in the US. This is why the US imposes tariffs on their green technologies. China spends the most out of any countries GDP ratio on their infrastructure. Theyre still way behind because theyve only been around for 75 years but I would say theyve made more progress than the United States has in that amount of time, especially in the last 20 years. China has less than half of the United States national debt. China is not bogged down in international conflicts abroad in the Middle East and Ukraine.

One way to go is an equally weighted SP 500 ETF such as RSP, it has the same 500 components as the SP but in equal weighting. This does mean that you have a larger weighting for small companies like Zions Bancorp but even the tiniest companies in the SP are pretty big.

Over the last 23 years I loaded up on 4.5 to 5 yielding instruments. My bond ladder is 12 years out and overall the fixed income portion is giving me about a 4.9 yield. I do have some Ford SP rated BBB Moodys rated Ba giving me about a 7.4 YTM, maturing in 2047, but Im keeping an eye on that in terms of business conditions at Ford. Thats propping up the yield a bit. Ive simulated included inflation interest rate risk over the next 12 years by assuming yields dropping on 1015 year maturities to the 3.25 range included some BBB rated bonds in the mix.

The US accounts for 50 of total stock market cap in the world. 2. There are other popular indexes, like Nasdaq, Dow, Russell, but really for all intents and purposes SP 500 is the one. Why? Because it has the most consistent history. Dow is hand picked, Nasdaq is very tech focused, etc. 3. If you really want to own the entire entire market, youd buy VT, which buys 99 of all publicly traded companies in the world. 4. Yes, QQQ has down well, but so has AAPL. So why not just buy that? Because the point of buyandhold setitandforget it investing is picking a lowcost diversified indexlike VOO, and buying consistently over time. If you buy consistently also known as dollarcost averaging big swings like the dot com bubble, 08, COVID, mean nothing in the long run.

So, some tweaking, some additions but netnet havent really added much in a while. Are you still finding value in specific sectors or stocks, or are you shifting to a more defensive strategy? Not shifting more defensive. For me, I tend to have a good sense of my investment risk tolerance and spend most of the time near that level. Some times Ill dial risk back a little but the only time Ill have large scale sales is when I want to dial back a theme materially or remove it entirely. Then reallocating those funds elsewhere might take days or weeks. There are still some compelling values and am finding some small new ideas but nothing major. You have a market imo where if you look around, there are parts of the market that look like theyre in recession already and maybe you find 12 things in that pile where the decline is excessive, there are parts of the market that are doing well and have strong tailwinds but are overcrowded and where everyone wants to have the same playbook and theres a lot inbetween those extremes. For those who have been through similar market phases before, how did you manage your portfolio during such times? I think people have to really focus on their best ideas. You have people who own something and then its down 1 and theyre like WHAT IS GOING ON!?!?!? What are names you can own where you are confident enough in the 691218mo outlook where your first instinct when its down is not to hit the sell button but to consider whether to buy more? If you were told you couldnt sell any of the stocks you owned for a year would you be bummed with anything you own being stuck with it for a year? Peter Lynch said this and I think its very true And the single most important thing to me in the stock market, for anyone, is to know what you own. I am amazed at how many people own stocks, they would not be able to tell you why they own it. They couldnt say in a minute or less why they own it. Actually, if you really press them down, theyd say, The reason I own this is the sucker is going up. And thats the only reason. Thats the only reason they own it. And if you cant explain Im serious, if you cant explain to a 10yearold in two minutes or less why you own a stock, you shouldnt own it. And thats true I think of about 80 of people that own stocks. If youre concerned, go through your portfolio with a strong filter and get rid of anything that sounded interesting at the time, youre soso about, etc and replace it with ideas that you have more confidence in andor build on existing best idea holdings. Do you think this rally is justified given the macroeconomic conditions, or are we ignoring potential risks? Peter Lynch again Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, than lost in the corrections themselves. Can one have an opinion on macro? Sure, absolutely. IMO though, too many people prioritize their personal view of the macro in their universe and the result is them constantly looking for justification to sell.

That being said, no one knows what taxes will actually be in 25 years. No one knows if theyll make more money near retirement compared to 25 years before retirement.

Reddit,2024-09-17,"Lots of good answers here. One thing I think people overlook for the average person investing in a retirement fund is mindset when choosing what contributions they can make. If they go into the example you provided where they can only afford 100 reduction in their post contribution earnings then in really comes down to tax expected earnings and tax rates currently compared to retirement as many people have noted here. However, I think practically that is not the decision making practice that a lot of average people are making. They are contributing x of their income from their paycheck typical for a work run retirement account. Or a set dollar amount, such as 100 in your example. Then deciding which one it should go into. If the person has this mindset then in reality a Roth is an effective way to end up saving more money. Instead of contributing 100 into traditional or 75 into Roth as your example provides, many are choosing an option of 100 or 100 in their rationaledecision making process. In this case you are taking 25 more in tax burden in the current year, but effectively saving an additional 25 for retirement that will also get interest taxfree. And for the average person that will result in a much larger retirement fund with Roth than traditional. I like advocating for Roth for this reason. Clearly you dont fall into this category, as you are thinking about these things and reducing Roth contribution to counteract the tax burden in your example. However, I will say dont underestimate the benefit of Roth not falling under required withdrawals that a traditional has as others have noted.

Roths are not subject to this, so in a sense, that money is protected. That money can stay in a taxfree account until late in your life. 2.

The other is the actual tax brackets. If you are working and are in, say, the 24 tax bracket.

Reddit,2024-09-17,"Your math is correct, but your premise includes a couple of assumptions that certain things remain constant 1. Tax policy Even if your income remains constant, changes to tax policy will affect the relative aftertax perfomance of a traditional vs. a Roth. In this case its a question of what you think will happen personally I find it hard to believe as someone in my mid30s that tax rates will be lower 30 years from now compared to today. 2. Tax bracket Even if tax policy remains the same, where you fall in the tax scale absolutely can change. Most people have lower incomes in retirement but this isnt always the case. These factors are almost certain to change over a timespan of a few decades, so the question is which way do you think they will go. Traditional IRAs have the advantage of providing an immediate tax benefit, whereas with a Roth you have to hope that Congress doesnt change the law over the next 3040 years unlikely, but anything is possible. The way I see it, Roths generally make more sense for people with lower incomes because they can take advantage of the lower tax rates they currently enjoy and have that money and its earnings never be taxed again. For higher income earners, a traditional IRA is the way to go as the tax benefit from deducting the contribution is much more valuable.

You could go from married filing jointly to single which could definitely change the calculations.

Reddit,2024-09-17,"7,000year into an IRA is 583month. Some people cannot afford to contribute that much, and perhaps send maybe 100month. It all depends on if you need a tax deduction now, or when you retire. Most people imagine that they will stop working at 65ish and then retire, perhaps occasionally draw some money out of the IRA to pay bills, and since they are living off of Social Security, they are bringing home 12 of what they normally make from a paycheck. This means that they will be in a much lower tax bracket. Perhaps 12 instead of 18, as an example. There are many factors, but if you feel that you would be better off getting the tax deduction when you are in your 40s when you are making high earnings and pay high taxes, then do so. Some people are struggling and hope to find some way to buy a house someday, but...My cars are paidfor and my house payment is low. This means that when it comes to my monthly expenses, I can easily put large amounts in my IRA and I dont need a tax deduction to achieve my goals. For me, it boils down to this...If I put 583month in an IRA its maxed out, whether its a traditional or Roth. When I get past 65, pulling money out of the IRA means its taxed even though its at a lower rate, as we said before, and the Roth is not taxed when the money is withdrawn. If you need 3,000, a Roth draws out 3,000. A Traditional draws out 4,000, and sends you 3,000...withholding 1,000 to cover potential taxes in April. Therefore, the remaining balance continues to grow from interest and stock growth, but the Traditional has less money, and it gets smaller faster when withdrawing, compared to Roth. If your IRA will have a significant amount in it by the time you reach 65 or whenever you retire, The Roth seems much better for the retiree, even though it cost you some federal taxes when you were younger. If you can afford to put the max 583mo in an IRA, you may be able to reach a tipping point where your IRA grows faster than your withdrawals. That might be somewhere around 300K, where a 10 bump in the stock market equals 30K Of course if you will only have 10K in an IRA when you retire, the difference between a traditional and Roth is pretty small.

For example, required minimum distributions could force you into higher brackets. A distribution to buy a car, or take a nice trip, etc. They all become taxable events with marginal tax consequences. Having after tax dollars in your portfolio allows you more flexibility to stay under bracket limits. After tax also dont have RMDs and heirs wont have to liquidate inheritated IRAs within 10 years.

Reddit,2024-09-17,"Roth is not better than Traditional because tax free growth. Both Trad and Roth have taxfree growth. That is, realized gains inside the account are not subject to capital gains taxes. This is not the case for a taxable brokerage, so there is generally some level of tax drag for money in a taxable brokerage that is absent in Trad or Roth accounts. Youre correct if your income tax stays the same, Trad and Roth work out to be equal. What often happens is your Roth contributions get taxed at your marginal tax rate, but youre pulling the money out of Trad retirement accounts at something closer to an overall rate in retirement, which usually makes Traditional look better than Roth... though itll depend on your particular assumptions about withdrawals, tax rates in the future, etc. The other exception assuming equal tax rates is that Roth accounts have functionally higher limits. For instance, 7,000 is the most you can contribute to an IRA. If youre contributing 7,000 Roth, thats equivalent at your theoretical 25 tax rate to 9,333 in Traditional contributions. But you cant make more than 7,000 per year in IRA contributions. And with IRA accounts in particular, there are income limits that change how things work. For instance, you lose the ability to deduct Traditional IRA contributions at around 72,000 filing single which makes Roth strictly better beyond that limit... at least up to the cap for Roth IRA contributions 150k ish at which point, backdoor Roth would be the way. End of day, it usually makes sense to have some money in both buckets then you control the income you show by Rolling Trad money into Roth accounts, and live off Roth money which doesnt impact your income. That way you can play tax games, smooth out income shown and avoid crossing some barrier for medicare subsidies, etc. But for most people, the majority of the money in Trad accounts is fine.",Neutral,0,0.9995858073234558,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-17,"Ill put this concept out there think of a Roth as a place to keep your emergency funds. Why? Because withdrawing principal is always tax and penalty free.

The major benefit to this is that, most people wont have a true financial emergency, or if they do, its rare and infrequent. If it happens, you can access the money as its needed. If it doesnt, you will have a lot more available to you in retirement than had you kept it in a savings account. For this advice to work however, it needs to be part of a larger retirement and investment strategy that includes a traditional IRA, a pension, 401K, social security, and a taxable brokerage account.

Assets have not been appreciating, the USD is continuously losing value due to printing more of it. Why do you think central banks are the major purchasers of gold over the last few years? They are all trying to ditch the dollar. If i ever wanted to move countries, the safer bet is to exchange gold for the local currency vs risking holding onto fiat dollars. Just imagine the guy who kept 10K in their safe for emergency money vs the guy who kept gold. Gold guy could go to any country and fetch the spot rate or just under with limited trouble... the guy with USD likely going to be more limited in terms of countries that make the most sense, especially ones with currencies devaluing at a slower rate.",Neutral,0,0.9504424333572388,Reply

He has a number of dealers and brokers he works with, and routinely gets calls to solicit him to sell parts of his collection, or to get him to add to it. Selling coins typically looks like multiple detailed photos of the coin, preferably in its original packaging. Bullion and items made from precious materials are a little harder to move, because fewer people want them, but it works the same way. However, with bar and scrap gold, you can sell to goldsmiths who do custom work, and precious items can be sold to or sold on consignment at jewelry stores. Some brokers provide an escrow service, where the buyer pays the middleman, the seller delivers to the middleman, the middleman verifies the quality or authenticity of the item and releases the money. Other times, if youve been around for a while and know people, and havent stiffed anyone, brokers will arrange a sale between trusted parties as a way of building relationships with both parties. You can also just up and sell on ebay, and depending on what you have that might be the best way to go.

Also, the greater the volume, the easier it is to negotiate your rate. Remember you never have to sell to one bullion dealer over another.",Neutral,0,0.9908081889152527,Reply

That almost exclusively happens due to how people feel, unless its an ETF of producers which may pay some dividend. Industrial use doesnt really fluctuate that much so the major mover events are based on fear. Gold operates a bit differently than standard stocks and thus can be a hedge against soke fluctuations in the market. Definitely but its because of mass perception and the belief that it will at a minimum be stable or grow during bear markets and retain value in an inflationary environment. But in the absence of those conditions it languishes or plummets. People were underwater on gold for many years after the big last run of irrational exuberance. This most recent run up was due to the crazy period of inflation. It reminded me of a huge gold run in the early 80s which was the last period of inflation weve had. Theres nothing wrong with investing some money in a Gold ETF. I didnt really say otherwise. I mostly dunked on bullion. I also said Ive owned GLD once. It just doesnt interest me much unless it basically craters again. Gold is highly cyclical.

Reddit,2024-09-12,"There are solid reasons why gold is valuable and none of them are mystical. Gold is an element so it cant be manufactured or counterfeited to any serious degree. Thus it is intrinsic basis for a stable money supply without needing to develop advanced anticounterfeiting measures. Gold is physically stable, portable, and malleable which makes it practical as a currency and preferable in those ways compared to barter. Gold is rare enough and difficult enough to extract that it can act as a fairly dense store of value. If it were more common and easier to extract then it would be less practical because you would need a large amount of gold to pay for things. If someone had a job with a similar amount of physical effort as panning for gold, their pay for that job in gold would need to be at least as much as the amount of gold they could pan for in the same amount of time.",Neutral,0,0.9621134996414185,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-12,"Part 1 the prequel I am in my thirties and was born towards the end of the Lebanese Civil War, which lasted 25 years. Before the war, Lebanon was prosperous, and the Lebanese Lira was recognized in major European exchange offices. However, 25 years of civil conflict changed everything. After the war, and for the entirety of my consciousness, a man named Rafic Hariri, among others, attempted to establish a system to rebuild the country. Whether he knew it or not, he was setting the stage for what would become one of the greatest thefts in history. The plan was to borrow large sums of money to build infrastructure that would eventually generate revenue, repay the debt, and put Lebanon back on the map. Many countries supported this plan, given Lebanons cultural advancement and its strong diaspora, so the money started flowing. Hariri had the political power to make this plan legally viable. However, with the influx of money came corruption and foreign intervention. Hariris plan favored one sect over another, creating a deep divide in the country. Since Lebanons sects are almost evenly divided, maintaining political support for his plan required sharing the cake among different groups. But by 2005, one grouplets call them the Axisrealized they no longer needed to share because they had external funding and weapons, giving them the upper hand. Hariri was assassinated. From an economic perspective, the system initially designed to fund rebuilding projects slowly shifted toward benefiting those in power. Public sector jobs were handed out as favors, rewarding supporters regardless of productivity. Instead of investing in sustainable projects, they funded lowquality infrastructure, paying exorbitant amounts for kickbacks. Yet, the banking sector appeared strong on the surface. For my whole life i thought we had a strong banking system. I didnt know anything else. To me you always get intehrest and real estate always goes up.. it was a sure thing. Same as you believe bonds are always good. And SP is safe.. but now I know unless you hold it in your hand. Its not yours. The central bank, backed by government legislators everyone was complicit in this vicious cycle of mutual coverups, worked with banks to acquire more debt. They enticed depositors with increasingly highinterest rates to keep the money flowing. Anyone with a basic understanding of economics could see it was a nationwide Ponzi scheme. Fast forward to 2019 Hezbollah had become dominant in the political scene. The U.S. imposed sanctions on key institutions, and the Ponzi scheme began to unravel, leading to total economic collapse. Part 2 the collapse From 2019 to 2021, Lebanons economic collapse deepened, devastating the banking sector and peoples lives. You would think people would ruch to get their money out. But banks were closed. During closure, only bank owners and the complicit political class took their money out. The rest of the people couldnt do anything. The majority was still politically blindly following their political leader. The Lebanese pound, once pegged to the U.S. dollar, lost over 90 of its value. Hyperinflation set in, and prices of basic goods soared. Banks froze accounts, imposed strict withdrawal limits, and converted dollar savings at a fraction of their value, wiping out life savings. There was a civil uprising. People closed all roads and hit the streets for weeks. But the political main actors refer to prequel where people were handed out public sector jobs.. Well those were a lot who happened to also have weapons donations from foreign countries seeking influence quelled the uprising on one end On the other end the central bank reserve still had USD stores. To control the upsurge they started subsidising fuel and food... and before you think it was a noble thing to do, it was actually another way to pay pro corrupt government individuals since subsidised goods were sold at full price in neighbouring countries benefitting said axis refer to Part 1. The middle class fell into poverty as unemployment soared and salaries became nearly worthless. Businesses shut down, and basic utilities like electricity and water became scarce. Fuel shortages led to long lines and violent confrontations. The healthcare system neared collapse, with shortages of medicine and an exodus of medical staff. The Beirut port explosion in August 2020, which killed over 200 people and devastated large parts of the city, underscored the countrys deeprooted corruption and negligence. Amid this, many families survived only through remittances from relatives abroad. Those without relatives overseas had to send their young to find work in other countries. For those left behind, life became a daily struggle to afford food, medicine, and fuel. People waited in endless queues for essentials, power outages lasted up to 22 hours a day, and crime rates rose sharply. By the end of 2021, Lebanon was gripped by despair, its society deeply fractured by economic collapse, political paralysis, and corruption. The country still hasnt recovered. And might never do. A big chunk of productive people have left the country and those remaining are outnumbered by those who got us into this mess. The corruption is so deep rooted its not only in high officials, but within people. People want to vote for x mafia boss because x has been their provider all their lives. The last elections after the collapse ended with results similar to those before the collapse. Unbelievably sad but true.",Neutral,-1,0.9905646741390228,Reply

The world will figure out Bitcoin over time, there will be a day when I run out of suckers to dump government monopoly money on for their goods and services and eventually I will have to spend my Bitcoin to get the things I want.

Reddit,2024-09-12,"The collapse of the US dollar is already underway. Gold is hitting new records for a good reason The world is getting nervous about the dollar, its monetization as a weapon, and the ballooning US debt. Central Banks are furiously adding to Gold reserves. The Gold Standard was never problematic. If you study the monetary history of the world, the fiat currencies lime the USD have all failed in the end., Simple reason Fiat money is not backed by anything and countries succumb to the temptation of printing, crazy amounts. Why? Because they dont have to back it against anything. The trouble starts when a countrys fortunes start to flounder. Then, no one wants to hold that countrys fiat currency and it hastens the collapse. US is inching toward that reality. The only viable and trustworthy currency is one that is backed by gold. Otherwise its just a paper IOU, acceptable while the issuing country is strong, but not so when the holder starts to worry if the IOU they hold may not get honoured. Thats when theyll insist on getting gold to safeguard their interests. If a countrys currency is not backed by gold, no one will want to touch it eventually. That dark day may not be tomorrow but it is not far if the US mints keep printing indiscriminately. CBO estimates that the US debt will be around 53 Trillion dollars by 2030!!

Reddit,2024-09-09,"No more time than you would have to spend on a dividend stock.. Real estate investment trusts are fairly simple businesses. Think of owning a beach house and renting it out. They are no More complicated than that. They own Commercial real estate principally or other assets like data centers or Residential and those properties have a value or net asset value or book value. They collect rents, pay their borrowing costs and expenses, and the difference is the profit which is distributed at least 90 of taxable income per year to the shareholders. via a fairly large dividend. They provide huge tax benefits. Theyre fairly simple to evaluate and understand and per multiple European studies and American studies. Their long term performance is two to 3 higher than the S and P 500. Now obviously nothing has beaten the S and P 500 since March of 2009 when its been zero interest rates and everyone piling into tech stocks to the moon. But this wont last forever. Everything always reverts to the mean.

This is only true as of the initial purchase date however, since stock prices move. If stock A goes to 15shares but stock B doesnt move, RSP will now own 50 more of Stock A than stock B.

Reddit,2024-10-27,Theres two ways you can learn to trade. Day trading with short term contracts which means having a decent understanding of TA and a good control of your emotions. I suck at that one. Or once you get more money you can learn how trade longer term options and play fundamentals and news cycles. The second is way more forgiving but requires more capital. Just focus on learning to be better and dont think youre invincible. It took me losing a lot of money before I realized I suck at day trading but Im decent at following trends and getting value from that. Also a hell of a lot of luck thrown in. No single trading strategy works for everybody so just play it slow unlike I did until you figure out what trading style suits you. Also stop buying weeklies until you have a much better grasp on the market. And dont be upset when you inevitably blow up one or two or three accounts lol,Neutral,0,0.6678138375282288,Reply

I wanted to short Tesla back in the day but didnt want to deal with it expiring and me having to cover my short which is how i maybe falsely understand classic shorting. So I shorted using the short ETFs for about 4 months and made a few grand in the end which was a large amount because I didnt invest loads.

Reddit,2024-10-21,"Everyone is different but blowing up your account is often a good time to take a break and reflect. Letting the person earn back their own money is a lesson they need to learn. The best time to jump back in is after a market crash since its easy money good time to rebuild an account. Ill offer some things Ive learned over a couple decades of on and off trading, making and losing and remaking some rather large sums of money. Because just browsing through these comments Im going to venture most of the people offering advice havent actually blown up an account before and are just memeing. First and foremost it should be a what did I learn moment, so you can avoid doing it again, at least the same way. Mistakes and bad luck happen in the market, so its totally possible to learn from your first experience and still blow up the account again. But if you arent learning and getting better, youre just a degenerate gambler. One of the most important elements is that you shouldnt be investing money you cant afford to lose, whether its in a high risk investment or not, because low risk investments sometimes go bust too. Keep that shit in a checking account or iBond if youll need it within a couple years. And once you get into the 100k range you should be diversifying a bit not going allin on one risky play maybe even at 50k, if youre being conservative Second, buy things you wantneed along the way. If you scrimp and save and never buy anything, and then lose all your money, youll feel worse because of all the austerity you experienced for no reward. If you have what you need to be comfortable the loss hurts less. Third, reevaluate your highrisk gambles on a regular basis, dont just throw your chips down and wait for it to moon or bust. Sometimes the situation changes and you need to acknowledge when your initial thesis is no longer on the table and its time to get out with whatever is left, even if its only 510. But always have a reason for getting in, and a target for getting out before you even buy in, that way even if you lose you know why and had a rational reason for it, not an emotional miscalculation. And last, when Im considering whether I should sell a losing investment I like to look at it from a position of least regret. This isnt an objective sell at 50 loss rule, its unique to each person. If you take the loss and the gamble turns around and skyrockets, would you feel better or worse than if you didnt sell and lost the entire amount? Because in volatile stocks weird things happen sometimes, so sometimes taking a position off the table completely even though its the conservative approach might not be the best for everyone. You definitely preserve more capital that way, but sometimes its better to avoid being screwed by lady luck, from a mental health perspective. But you cant do that on everything, you need to be able to recognize a well and truly dead investment and salvage the scraps.",Neutral,-1,0.5394833385944366,Reply

Denison bought uranium on the spot market when things were still recovering. NexGen waited until 2024. Whether the purchase is an investment to hold value, or to hold as future forward deliveries before production ramps up, it was kinda late. Denison plans to sell another few hundred thousand lbs of uranium they mightve already, havent checked in on them since February and keep the rest on hand for forward delivery IIRC.

Reddit,2024-10-20,"Hi everyone, For those looking at a kind of turbo on Nexgen Energy share price, a bit under the radar at the moment Here is my detailed overview on Mega Uranium MGA on TSX Mega Uranium is in fact a small uranium fund held by the big Uranium sector ETFs Today Mega Uranium share price traded at 0.39 CADsh, while the NAV on October 18th was at 0.6177 CADshare. This is a 37 discount to NAV! In previous high season in the uranium sector that discount to NAV was 15. We are now in the first month of the new high season. In the meantime Nexgen Energy NXE is a large cap where most investors go to when they hear about the uranium sector. NXE share price will increase together with the other uranium company stocks.

You may be right autonomy trucking business may become a thing but it is years away. In the meantime, its financial numbers will be miss after miss. Teslas will report its earnings is this week. The numbers will be horrible because it tried to boost volume in expense of profit. What other revenue stream will come out for Tesla in the near term? These next few years timeframe? In the meantime, it has a PE of 62 when BYD, a growing company has PE of 22. If you just valuate Teslas EV business, it should be worth 60 to 70 at best. The overvaluation is because people are pricing in autonomy in the share price before Tesla has achieved it. Not to mention, the path to get there will not be easy. In terms of rival competition, in terms of government regulation, in terms of whether the technology will actually work and now you have Musk going off the deep end. Anyway, good luck this week.

Reddit,2024-10-15,"If you overlay interest rates overtime onto a chart with TREE, it essentially trades completely inverse to interest rates. I doubt its quite that simple. Their best financial performance was FY 2019 when they recognized 1.1B in revenue and their stock price hit 450 in June of that year. the fed rate in 619 was 2.4. From there, rates were lowered to basically 0over the next year, and kept there for the next two years until rate increases began mid 22. During that time the value of lending tree stock fell from 450 to 60. Again, the interest rate was basically 0 for the entire time. TREE was one of many overly hyped fintech stocks carrying a PE over 250 at its peak. Their financial performance never met the hype and the price fell as a result. As interest rates went down, so did their revenue. I expect them to do better moving forward, but I doubt the market rewards them with such ridiculous valuations again.",Positive,1,0.8290802240371704,Reply

I would not idolize this industry if I were you Ive learned more in my two years out of private industry than my time in it. Ive also been able to stay more up to date. You say its incredible to think that QC cant help with AI, Id argue the exact opposite. 1 ML is inherently a big data problem, something QC is bad at because youd need to load in and read out data. Part of the reason factoring is such a good problem for QC is because it is relatively easy to load a 2048 bit integer. Whereas in ML youd probably have to load your training data, which would be expensive if you have a lot. 2 maybe youd be looking at solving some optimization problem related to training, at best that would have a Grover sqrt type speedup which would quickly get eaten by error correction overhead rendering it practically useless 3 current methods use variational quantum circuits and classically optimize them, which have no fundamental speedup and people can only point to heuristic improvements. These are on toy problems essentially. For large scale ML this would probably not work at all I mean youre free to consider this a larp and invest in this company with your current knowledge.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"A CSuite SVP. As leavings go. Id say he will be missed and is leaving on great terms. From LinkedIN ARCHERS ASSEMBLE without me.After almost exactly 3 years at Archer I have decided to move on.When I joined Archer after a few coffee chats with Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein and some insight into what they were up for, the company was in a quite early stage. The powertrain team that I took over was less than 15 people. We used mainly off the shelf components, motors, inverters and battery cells from prototype vendors.Fast forward to 2024, the powertrain team is more than 150 people in total. Alex Clarabut leading battery, Dillon Thomasson drive units, Stephen Spiteri power electronics and Paul Frihauf leading BMS to name just a few. All rockstars in their fields of expertise. For sure the best team in the hashtagevtol industry. And one of the best in the whole ,,electric transportation of any kind industry.We have designed and validated our own motors, inverters, batteries and battery management systems. Hardware, controls, software, system integration we did it. We have established a close development and commercial cooperation with our battery cell supplier Molicell. We have established close collaboration with the Stellantis engineering community Ned Curic Michael Bly other words Powertrain is set up for success and a safe launch.On the manufacturing side it was pretty clear that no existing supplier could give us what we need the combination of aviation certified manufacturing and leading edge EV craftsmanship. So we designed our own scaleable manufacturing system. And built it. And brought it up. And it runs very well. Kudos to Isaac Harper and Heath Smoot team is set up so well that they will be just fine without me. Which I consider the ultimate goal of a leader built a team that is so good that they can do great without you. YOU GOT THIS, ARCHER POWERTRAIN TEAM!!! So for me its time to move on. I have not 100 decided yet what to do next. It will for sure be in the ,,electrification space. The intention is also to revive my European roots and at least have one leg in Germany. Germany treated and educated me very well kudos to my Alma Mater Ruhr University Bochum I am very excited about the next weeks and months and about the choices and decisions to be made.

If youre really interested in the companyplay it wouldnt be a bad idea to listen throughwatch the investor conference they had along with this earnings. Im tentatively bullish on the company still. I think Lemonis has a lot of good ideas and has reformed after giving too many overly optimistic projections. He seems to be making much more conservative promises. I think having physical towel stores again is going to be a great thing for the company, letting people out in the world know that the brand still exists. Lemonis bought 1.5m in shares after the earnings reportthe stock tanking, which was by far his largest buyin to date. That unfortunately for me did absolutely nothing to move the stock up. I think the market is waiting for tangible results before theyre going to reprice. Shorts are probably still hoping for the bankruptcy. There was a lot of other bullish news before and after earnings, and again, none of that did anything to positively impact the price of the stock. That said, I think the stock is still highly undervalued even for the current situation. The company has a good balance sheet and other valuable assets.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"This kind of thinking is exactly what causes financial crisis situations. On the level of the economy as well as on a business or personal level. I got private loans offerings at 3.25 and can put those on accounts, offering 3.75 yearly. Sounds like the perfect arbitrage. Only the loan will run for years fixed and the rates for the account are not guaranteed. If you bet the loan on the SP on average every year you will beat the interest. No doubt. The problem is, that there is always a chance you hit the year with the stock market crashing and being depressed for 2 or 3 years. If you have bet your companies money on those gains, your company is likely to struggle from the overall situation and additionally from having to pay back the loan. Which likely means, you will have to sell the assets you bought at a loss in order to stay liquid. There is no free money. If this offer was that good, the bank would buy the SP and not offer you the loan at these conditions. You should trust their economists to do the math, how risky that business is. But I am not an expert either. Just another gambler sitting at the bar talking.",Negative,-1,0.9170434474945068,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-11,"If you really thought it was a good decision you wouldnt be asking. Lets put it in perspective. In 19261928 the stock market did so well that it was estimated that 45 of traders bought stock with borrowed money. When money is easy to get, people tend to be sloppy with it. In 1929, fueled by runups by never before seen frenziedpace, the stock market took one too many steps out on the ledge and found it had nothing but air propping it up. A slight pullback led to panic selling and margin calls. Which set forth a downward spiral of fear, panic, margin covering, and a firesale to liquidate, no matter what. Borrowed money. Caused it all. Borrow money for speculation ONLY IF you have the funds to repay it tomorrow.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Ill be the outlier here. I do it. Current loan is an Amex personal loan. 25,000. 6.98 4 years, 598 a month. Interest averaged out across the four years is 75 a month. Current brokerage balance is 160k including the 25k and what its made minus payment. I make about 1 a week on deployed capital wheeling stocks plus appreciation when it goes up. I dont tend to sell at the basis calls. I dont yolo. I dont like meme stocks, I have my set of tickers that I stick to. 1 on !25k is 250 a week. 1,000 a month. Minus 598, I have 400 a month positive cash flow on top of paying down the loan. As mentioned averaged out per month interest is 75. I bring in 1,000 a month off of spending 75. Yes its lower at the start, roughly 145 a month interest first month and goes down over time to a few bucks the last month. 1,000 on 75 is 1,333 a month return on cash spent. Minus taxes I know. 33 taxes 660 on 75 is still 880. Obviously some months is a little less, some months is a little higher. Guy asked a question and I answered. People on here tell someone not to trade with borrowed money to wheel. A lot of people will mess it up. One of you bought like 800k of intel at the top with grandmas inheritance and it tanked. I thought this group was just everyone sharing their calculated bad ideas.... Some work, some dont. At the end of the day, if I get in trouble, I can pay off the loan. Currently 17k left on it.

So you might be tempted to think its predictable. But a lot of people are also misreading those cycles. Theyre not perfect linear cycles. So dont get too cute thinking you got the cycles figured out. That said, you are right that we should curb our expectations if we get another bullrun. Those cycles are tapering down and seem to get less intense each time.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"Mining is the validation mechanism of block generation. Mined blocks are then distributed across all other mining nodes to confirm the validity of the transactions. A mining pool is a shared distribution of mining processing power. While the individual miners are independent hardware, they share the responsibility for transaction and block validation. The point I was trying to make is that a collective of many independent miners who operate as a collective single identity could be so inclined to operate in bad faith to manipulate the transactions added to a block. This is the principle idea behind the 51 attack. Should a mining pool control the majority of validation nodes processing power, then they can effectively control the future of transactions added to blocks. I think any mining pool found to be doing this would probably see a mass exodus and the faith and value of Bitcoin would suffer. But I think there are at least a few Nationstates that would be inclined to shake those branches for whatever reasons. As for Mandala, no surprises there that youve not heard of it. Simply a point that the function of Blockchain goes beyond the use case of a financial tool and investment device.

Im more focused on the next 13 years.

Im skeptical about how smart these LLMs really are, and there are many other forms of AI that have potential too. Additionally, NVIDIAs valuation is influenced by factors like demand for gaming GPUs, data center growth, and the overall semiconductor market trends. However, with a 3 trillion market cap, Im curious to see if they can maintain that level. It seems heavily tied to momentum and hype, and we all know hype can fizzle out.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"I hope youre right, Im not one of those who takes pleasure in a good company gone bad. But their track record is shit. They went from industry leader to repeat laughingstock in 10 years. I know a lot of Bay Area engineers and none would touch a job at Intel for any amount of money itd be career suicide for them. The deck is stacked against them. Their valuation may be book look up goodwill if you want to see whats written in the book but they are priced at book value for a company that was expected to be an industry leader in about 10 different areas. Their future plans dont include industry leadership in any area and they are exiting more than half of the markets theyve been working in and borrowing money to do XX billion capex in. Its no joke to spend 20B on capex in the hope of entering a market, and then exit that market. Its no joke to do that in 5 different markets in 10 years. Its no joke to put out a quarterly report showing you lost 9 billion in 3 months, after your turnaround was supposed to have been under way for a year and a half. As an investor you have the option to invest in other companies, ones that dont flush 100 billion down the toilet. The idea that theyve gotten away with it for this long is not a bull pitch it means there are a set of entrenched managers there who think its OK to run their business this way. Ill be interested when the stock price hits 1012 and I start hearing that people want to work there, because I think thats about where youd start seeing a chance for meaningful upside from a turnaround.

Look at NVDAits insanely overpriced because everyone and their mom is buying it, thinking the line will just keep going up forever. These companies have PE ratios over 60, which is ridiculous. Its starting to feel like the Dotcom bubble, but this time with AI. Honestly, outside of a few specific uses, AI is kind of useless in its current state and nowhere near as smart as people think. With the massive investments going into AI, the returns needed to justify them are just unrealistic. Sure, in the short term, the AI boom might keep pushing tech stocks and the market up, but once the returns dont materialize fast enough, the bubble is going to pop. Im not saying AI is a total flop, but were not there yet, and the market is way too impatient. Meanwhile, Intel is in a much better spot strategically. Theyre still super important for the U.S., consumer PCs, and cloud computing, and theres still huge demand for energyefficient chips.

That said, if the Israel Iran conflict escalates into a full blown regional war, oil markets could be significantly disrupted. Iran has the ability to mine Saudi and Kuwaiti ports, and the straight of Hormuz, where 30 of the global oil supply is transported. If it came to that, oil prices would seriously spike and wed be looking at a global recession. No one wants that.

Weve hit an equilibrium where US companies produce enough to keep the prices from going to 100, but theres no incentive to dive prices down to 40. US firms would straight lose money.

If youre the one that lost his job, its a recession for you even if your neighbors are all doing fine. Theres no catalyst though, is the thing. So it doesnt seem like a real crash is on the way. Theres some possibility that the data center spending by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. is a bubble and I would say its very possible, maybe even likely, that they are overbuilding to an extent.

Watch CCL earnings on Monday I expect they will post yet another record breaking Q. If consumer is so broke why are they spending on cruises? This was exactly my thesis coming into the summer, the uptick in Buy now pay later and seeing how no matter how much prices rose people were still buying stuff led me to believe a credit card delinquency was warranted and could spin into a recession. For example a Ford bronco selling for 2030k above msrp and people buying it. Crazy. But... Earnings were very strong. Inflation stayed mostly inline with expectations. Job market showed softening but holding. So, I lost some money on my hedges but my overall portfolio is doing great. There is something else you are not considering, which also makes your puts too much OTM. There is trillions of dollars on the sidelines. Many investors were doing the TBill and Chill. With rates dropping some of that money will go back into stocks. We have been seeing this happen for two weeks now. So expect this to continue slowly until the election.

A significant portion of consumers remain financially stable, and I observe a sizable group with substantial capital participating in the market. At the same time, another segment of the population has been left behind, unable to benefit from the rapid appreciation of assets, and they are experiencing financial hardship. Historically, when there is a large disparity between wealthier and struggling groups, it rarely bodes well for societal stability. Furthermore, this growing wealth gap undermines the predictive power of traditional economic indicators. Those who hold the greatest influence in the market have largely profited from the recent asset surge. As a result, their financial stability allows them to continue shaping market dynamics. Meanwhile, those left behind, though financially strained, may not represent a sufficiently large portion of market participants to significantly alter its direction.

Reddit,2024-09-25,"Many people have already done and posted these valuations of MAG7, COST, etc, and are not hard to google, but there has been little chatter imo on the consumer itself. Interesting, I feel that my experience browsing these forums has been the opposite. I see everyone going on and on about macroeconomics employment, whether the consumer is doing well or struggling, whether inflation will heat up or cool down, whether the Fed will cut the fed fund rate by 25 bps or 50 bps in one meeting as if it is the endall beall for determining bull market or bear market, and so on. I seldom see anyone even bears point out that the overall market is pretty freakin expensive right now valuationwise, and prices in not just a softlanding, but booming high earnings growth. And I get tired of seeing the bull hot takes of soft landing no recession stocks moon to infinity, as if simply not having a recession is the only bar that needs to be cleared for stocks to go up at a high rate of ever expanding price ratios. When it comes to mentions of specific individual stocks though, then I see valuation get brought up more often. I just dont see overall valuation get brought up as much when the discussion is about the overall market or market indices. All I see then is the economy this, the economy that. Thanks for the comment. Im actually interested how you would attempt to price these factors into already overvalued companies. Send me a PM of your thoughts. Where I think the SPY should be priced at is a bit nuanced, but my overall answer is roughly 1530 lower than it is now. If your case of a deteriorating US labor market and US consumer plays out, then maybe closer to the 30 perhaps. I think it would likely affect the SPY megacaps, but perhaps with a delayed effect. The end consumer struggles first, which then causes the businesstoconsumer companies that sell to them to struggle, which then in turn causes them to cut spending or close up shop, which then in turn causes the bigger B2B businesses like Microsoft, Google, Amazon AWS, and Meta that sell to those B2C businesses or to some other middleman B2B intermediaries down the chain to take a hit in their earnings but not a catastrophic one or anything like that. I think some companies are more overvalued than others and mayshould take a bigger hit, but Im feeling too lazy to go through each one right now. But I will say this for what I think of overall SPY valuation I use sites like currentmarketvaluation.com and multipl.com to see what the SP 500 is valued at overall vs. historical averages. Currentmarketvaluation shows the SP 500 Buffet Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion all being above or near 2 standard deviations above historical averages i.e. Strongly Overvalued, i.e. near the red dotted line. The last 2 times that happened were in 2021 and 19992000. So, that makes me bearish overall. Seeing the sentiment survey on aaii.com often a contrarian indicator leaning so heavily bullish in a historically very overvalued market makes me feel even more bearish. I feel like best case, the market is fairly valued right now if earnings growth is superb. If earnings growth is tepid, market is overvalued. If no earnings growth, even more overvalued. If earnings decline or recession, extremely overvalued. But in the meantime, clown market gonna clown market and algos will bubble it higher if theyre so determined to do so.",Neutral,0,0.9327893257141113,Reply

Since these have such a high weight on the market as a whole, the market will normalize, but it will look like a massive correction or even a crash. In reality, its just the rest of the market catching up to the progress made in the past 2 years, since the october 2022 bear market. If you think the market is going to rally huge, would it not make more sense to buy low and sell high, not buy high and sell higher?

Reddit,2024-09-25,"Exactly, all three things can be true. 1 The inflations primary cause was pandemic supply chain issues, higher energy prices, and higher housing costs, which were also tied at least partially to the pandemic. 2 The stimulus checks were, for the most part, needed. They could have certainly meanstested them, but at that point in time there was little political interest in doing anything controversial like not giving the rich more money. 3 The stimulus checks did cause even more inflation. Im not upset about anything the Fed or Congress did they did a pretty solid job considering what we were facing but theres no question mistakes were made. Not trying to meanstest the stimulus, raising rates too late, lowering rates too late, making the second round of stimulus too large all of those were mistakes looking in the rearview mirror. Not sure we can take any lessons from Congress here too much has and will change there but if Powell is kept on by the next administration Im guessing he stays pretty much like hes been, solidly managing things but reacting a tad late to everything out of an abundance of caution.",Negative,-1,0.9029214382171631,Reply

In that case if the government continues to issue debt without offsetting tax revenue youd have to expect some currency devaluation as bond issuances continue in which case I cant see people lending money to the government for 20 years for a 4 return. I think a massive steepening of the yield curve is a real possibility where the fed manipulates the short end while the long end sinks. But the most likely scenario is that it just settles at a slightly higher rate. TLDR I think theres a possibility that the Ron Paulpeter Schiff stances of 10 years ago do finally start to present themselves. Ten year bond auction in early October will be interesting to watch.,Negative,-1,0.9902200102806091,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-18,"Because nothing in the report shows anything of concern. Ive worked in SNFs in both East and West Coast. None of the practices are out of the norm. It just shows they increased services to their patients, and offered new services like respiratory therapy and sensory integration. This is how many LTCs are expanding to reduce readmission rates, limit fines. Using the COVID waiver to skillinplace was to avoid sending too many patients to the hospital which was overloading hospitals and making more people sick. LTC residents are a highly vulnerable group and needed increased assessments which is why the billing rates were at the 3x rate. If SNFs avoided this practice theyd be putting their patients at high risk. The report said PACS was misleading due to mentioned QM rates. That not misleading, its simply true. There are many factors that go into CMS ratings, from staffing ratios to number off falls, wounds, psychotropic use, etc. Its like a car company mentioning they have class leading fuel efficiency. Are they being misleading because they didnt mention that they DIDNT have class leading seat capacity? There is nothing misleading by mentioning your best assets, and thats what PACS did. They said administrators have limited experience and are bros. So effing what? They dont like that administrators are young and have a fun personality? Really? This whole report screams bias and nonsense in order for the activist short sellers to make a quick buck.",Neutral,0,0.656347930431366,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-18,I did thought that the report was garbage and added to my position initially. Digging a little bit deeper it seems to me that several SNFs have been sued for similar abuse none are public companies.

Reddit,2024-09-18,Just to bring some clarification. The devices were not simply hacked as many medias initially reported. They were already sabotaged before reaching Hezbollah as a final customer because Israeli discovered about the furniture. The devices have been filled up with a mix of explosive substances that needed heat to initiate the countdown. Now the hacking part is that Israeli knew a back door on the devices which allowed for temperature increases through specific commands that hit the battery which started the kaboom part on the hidden explosive. A lot of reports from hitten people prove that their devices started to feel very hot seconds before the explosion so the smart ones threw them away before.

Reddit,2024-09-18,"China does what China does well, sell things cheap. Consumers in SE Asia dont have as much to spend on stuff. Even as a US fat cat, I dont see it as worthwhile to spend on an iPhone when I can get a phone that does the same thing for a fraction of the cost. This is what killed Apple on PC, and they are repeating it with phones. Huwawei isnt competing with Apple, they are competing with Samsung, Motorola, HTC etc. iOS has had 30 of global market share for the past 15 years. Apple is sometimes the top selling phone maker globally but usually not. Right now that looks like Samsung. For someone with an average income of 10kyear like in Indonesia, that 1000 phone is priced out of reach. Would you spend 110th your yearly income on a phone? Tesla said at their inception their goal was to make an inexpensive electric peoples car. BYD beat them to the punch. The idea of making a cheap car is a good one, it is just the US makers cant get over their markups. Its more profitable to sell a 50k car than it is to sell a 10k car, just as it is more profitable to sell a 1000 phone than it is to sell a 200 phone. When you have a bunch of profit being made, someone is going to come in and undercut. If someone is making a zillion dollars doing something, someone else is going to find a way to do it for half a zillion dollars. This is the way. The Chinese, with their scale, are happy to make 10 on a widget when the US companies need to make 100 on the widget. Aside from just paying their people less and having the people profiting also be the regulators, they know they can scale to their own huge market, and extend that to the billions of people in the world that arent US rich. They also arent answering to shareholders demand for profit to the extent that US companies are.",Neutral,0,0.9986854195594788,Reply

Its pretty slim chances that happens, especially given the fact that AI is starting to show cracks in the foundation.

Big investment doesnt like not making money for an entire year, much less 18 months. Also, Nvidia cannot suddenly pivot and dump AI in favor of gaming cards. and Sony refuse to work with them so theyll never get into a console, and big expensive gaming cards are not something most people can afford right now, or for the foreseeable future.

Reddit,2024-09-03,"A straddle just means buying a call and a put at the same strike price. The market does have to move more than it would if you just had one or the other, in order to offset the loss incurred by the opposite, and since youre buying both calls and puts, its more expensive. Dont try this with an account less than 5k and dont try this on days where theres no news. A small move in the market will just make you lose more money. Im going to use the SPY as its cheaper than the SPX, but the same principle applies for both, the SPX is just 10x more expensive. The SPY is currently 551.05 in after hours. You would buy a call at 551.05 and a put at 551.05. Lets say you did a 0dte expiring tomorrow at EOD sept 4th. Do not accidentally buy a 0dte in after hours for eod today. There isnt enough liquidity after hours to ensure a sufficient move. As long as the SPY moves up to 555, or drops to 546, roughly a 5 move tomorrow, youll make money. Ordinarily, if you bought a call, it might have to only move 2.50 for you to begin making money but since youre also buying a put, it will have to move more. Thats okay, as long as you feel the market will make big moves, regardless of direction. Today was a perfect example. The SPY dropped 8 dollars, so you would have gone 3 in the money per contract. If you had bought 10 call contracts for 2770 and 10 put contracts for 1810, and the spy had gone up to 558, the 8 dollar move from today, you would have made 2420. If the SPY had dropped 8 to 543, you would have made 3670. Straddles are perfect for volatile markets. When you know theres big news coming, like GDP, or JOLT, or anything else that impacts the market in a big way, but you have no idea if its good or bad, its better to take a smaller profit by using a straddle, than risk everything by betting on a direction and being wrong 50 of the time. More like wrong 90 of the time, right? Thats how you wipe out your account, by chasing big gains when you could have make 2k today.

And while preying on the benefits of the poor has been a viable business model for decades, its not one I would invest in at this time as I expect a lot of volatility in the next decade. Costs of operations are exploding, and eventually the welfare system is going to require revamping as well, so there are pressures on both sides of their business model. Id be wary of businesses that are essentially government welfare parasites. Most boom for a short while, but eventually overplay their revenue stream because they come to believe theyre not tied to welfare money and are replaced by a new parasite.",Negative,-1,0.9999817609786987,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-31,"You could buy shares and create synthetic shorts against part of the position if you want to be basically risk free. If you think merger will happen. 48 of your shares will be bought for 15. The other 52 will convert but might be worth more than 15, exactly 15 or less than 15, who knows. Here is an example of the above. Buy 1000 shares. You will get 15 for 480 of them. Buy 52 ATM puts and sell 52 ATM calls for some expiration next year maybe June. Long puts and short calls will act exactly like shorting stock. As the stock goes down, the long puts increase in value and the short calls decrease you sold these so thats good. This is called a synthetic short. You are effectively offsetting any losses and gains in 52 of your shares with the synthetic short options. You will sell the other 48. This maths out to somewhere around a 20 gain on your entire position of shares as long as the merger happens with no risk on the other part of the position. You also collect around a 2 dividend yield on the shares you hold. You can also sell 10 puts for next year sometime.

Reddit,2024-08-31,"I took the 10 puts route, I have sold a large amount. I think that its very likely the merger happens and its not one that the US govt will try to block. I also think if the merger does not happen, PARA is actually way undervalued at 10. Both sides of the merger want it to happen. One possible issue is that shareholders sue because they think 15 is still too low for a buyout of their shares. I see worst case in that situation that the buyer raises the 15 price somewhat as it would still be a really good deal for them.

EDIT they do charge for possession for amounts that could lead to distribution, generally over an ounce. Places like Texas will prosecute and charge for possession with both state charges and federal charges at a much lower threshold. Why did you say Obama did it if it was in 2008? Thats still Bush. Also look how you had to go back more than a decade to find an example, whereas my governor DeSantis is currently fighting against legalization efforts in our state. One side has expanded access to cannabis and the other has restricted it. Its objective truth, but you can reject that if you want, all the other republicans are much more egregious about it.

Reddit,2024-08-20,My thoughts The fed is not going to reduce rates at the September meeting. Inflation is not where they need it to be and the economy is still strong. I listened to Jerome Powells press conference on July 31st and Im not sure where people are getting the idea that there will be a rate cut at the September meeting. All he basically said was that rate cuts would be ON THE TABLE in September if the data gives him more confidence that they are driving towards their 2 inflation goal. His statements are in no way a done deal that there will be a rate cut at the next fed meeting. The market is setting itself up for an upset.,Neutral,0,0.8056308627128601,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-20,"Buy the rumor sell the news! Thats what I see happening... the markets going up up on the rumor but the fundamentals have shifted wildly from the initial euphoria of QE. Remember debt is still VERY high, and liquidity in the market is causing all these inflation tantrums. So its a conflicting situation of sorts. E.g. because of high liquidity, people are ready to pay a higher premium. High liquidity essentially came from the QE in 2020 along with money distribution to help people survive job losses and other economic situations, but spending was far more curtailed because no travel, no eating out, not much vacations etc. So people saved a lot and that along with the 2022 ramp up, and then 2023 eruption in jobs and salaries along with the tech boom. Salaries that were high due to corporations feeling good with their valuations, based on stock markets which were pumped up by way of liquidity flowing there too. Not to mention the real estate craziness that fed into the cycle of flipping buying buying, driven by remote work and incentives to work hybrid coz companies saw that there were much more benefits e.g. no more insurance to pay for employees turning up at work, etc.. So all in all, the market is coming to a reconciliation and the push higher imo is a strategy by funds and MMs to push to highs and then sell at those highs, and after seeing many stock market greed movies WOWS, its not totally unfounded for this behavior to continue because, it always goes up.

Good news is they already have an I28 document published showcasing what implementation should look like by 2028. Theyve already stated that no designated air taxi routes will be in place by then. All air taxis will have to fly VFR, just like most personal aircraft do currently. And thats with a pilot on board. Autonomous commercial flight for air taxi will be at least a decade from now.

Reddit,2024-08-17,"Be careful!! UNG invests in Gas Futures Henry Hub. So that means it invests in gas delivered 12 months out. They sit currently at 2.1 or whatever. However, prices for JanFeb futures sit at 3.5. i suggest you read up on the term Contango. Basically, everything else equal, natgas front month could just tick up to 3.5 while UNG doesnt gain a single cent! Let that sink in. Put in other words Contango brings high rolling cost, when you change from front month to next, you can pay up. So while on the screen it shows you that gas is more expensive, UNG didnt increase. It just changed the contract. On the fundamental side there is a massive gas glut in US going on. Oil producers just do ,,drill baby drill because shale oil production is massively in the money.

Nat gas will remain useful to those who use it for heat, as it is far more efficient than other energies. My favourite example is the farmers.

There is only so much storage for this glut in supply, and the technologydemand for conversion to LNG cant keep up as of yet either. So as the demand for storage increases past the actual price of nat gas, nat gas prices turn negative. As long as this is a net positive for oil producers, they could care less about the biproduct.

To sustain AIs increase because they know they cant be left behind even if profits are not clear yet, they know they have to increase their energy usage by a lot. Renewable energy is not deployed fast enough, and nuclear energy is slow to deploy and problematic, especially in the US. Natural gas is one of the least dirty nonclean sources, and some data centers already have natural gas turbines to generate energy. The time frame is 1 to 5 years when things will get triggered.

Reddit,2024-08-17,"Maybe the term I am using is confusingincorrect. The positions are long NG. Downside means unrealized losses. Each 50 cent move down generates 5,000 loss per contract. So, a 0.50 drop equals 5,000 unrealized loss on the first position. Then you enter position 2. So, another 0.50 drop equals a 10,000 unrealized loss on position 1 and a 5,000 dollar unrealized loss on position 2. Then you enter position 3. So, another 0.50 drop equals 15,000 unrealized loss on position 1, a 10,000 unrealized loss on position 2, and a 5,000 loss on position 4. Then you enter position 4. There the exercise stops and the total unrealized loss at this point is 15,000 10,000 5,000 30,000. If price goes down the unrealized loss continues to grow.

Reddit,2024-08-17,"Hmm, tough to say. So on the gas power trading side the holy grail is to handle the fact that power is extremely spiky because it cannot be stored effectively. i.e. if you have a slight mismatch between demand and supply, your grid trips withing milliseconds. Different markets and roles are designed to secure stable operations. But for a trader that results in super nasty math, especially with more and more renewables entering the game. Think of it this way Generation is of highly stochastic nature, e.g. sun shines or doesnt, you know basically 5 min ahead and can lose double digit generation in a few minutes same with wind. Demand is a bit more projectable, but still stochastic depending on temperature, holidays, events, grid trips, etc.. So you have random input, random output, random pricing, random trader behaviour, etc. in a pretty fragile system and illiquid market. The arms race there is predicting and interpreting weather better and be able to trade, dispatch and balance extremely fast. On gas its similar, a bit less dramatic because you can store and compress to a certain extent grid doesnt trip in milliseconds, but rather minutes or hours. But trading is very much coupled to power, so it brings the same challenges as all is connected through nasty feedbacks. On top the challenge for gas is the geopolitical mess. In LNG the worst I have worked with are flexible LNG cargos, so basically you have a physical option with floating strikes. Say you have a cargo LNG that is set for Japan, but you can reroute if its more profitable to send to Europe. You can think of it as an option with the strike being the difference between European and Japanese gas price, and on top of it the freight cost and fuel difference. All of this is variable. Now if you take such a decision momentarily, you can fix all of it and lock in the profit for rerouting. The challenge starts when you need to value such an option in the future, e.g. to know how much you are willing to sell it for or buy it for. Figuring that out I would say is one of the most secret sauce for an LNG operation. Just off the top of my head, no claim for completeness or anything and Im sure there are pros around here that can challenge me on all this.",Neutral,0,0.9347694516181946,Reply

Now ur back at even and u say to urself Im still even ill just hold...weeksmonths pass and now ur down 1020 and u start to get nervous and that sinking feeling in ur stomach and decide to sell at a loss loosing 30k.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"CRWD currently provides the best endpoint security software out there at the moment from what Ive read, if youre a larger organisation, its the most secure easy to use product. In the industry and can confirm this. They are the closest thing to a Magic Bullet in endpoint security, as your organizations could be quite literally missing mostall other critical controls, inadequate staffing, incompetent employees, etc. and they will still have you covered. They absolutely fit the Clevel dream model of Cut a vendor a check and forget about it. Re the recent outage something critical to note is that both Crowdstrike and Microsoft were completely transparent regarding the outage, while Delta was not. This very much displays the sort of culture these companies have when managing risk. Ive used SentinelOne, but my experience with it is if you are doing any sort of development work on machines with it installed it will trigger false positives constantly. So the devs end up disabling it and you lose coverage in some of your most critical areas. PaloAlto is ok but you need to buy into their ecosystem.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"This is the weird thing though. Crowdstrikes services are the polar opposite of shit. Theyre the market leader in end point security. The creme de la creme. If it werent for the outage, and I was a CRWD salesman, I could probably tell the customer I fucked his wife and proceed to lay a fat shit out on the desk infront of them, and theyd still buy it. But with the outage, my only skepticism is whether this will put customers who dont already have a cybersecurity software away from Crowdstrike and end up choosing to go with a competitor purely because of the bad rep at the moment. That then slows growth during the aftermath period and without the crazy growth the price should in theory tank like fuck going by its current PE ratio.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"Stephan, you are telegraphing your insecurities. In a manner most regarded, I will say. Your CV, like my mine is public for all to see. Your research is dull, irrelevant and unsurprisingly you have no backgroundunderstanding of deep learning, large language models, generative pretrained transformers or really anything else relevant to any discussion in that space, so its no surprise you arent able to have a conversation with someone that actually understands these things. And even a simplification of these topics is a word salad to you. You apparently also dont understand anything about even basic systems engineering, to the point you think that Cloudstrike ?? is a boot ??? loader or something? Its not its the Falcon endpoint product that is a kernel driver that operates at ring 0 and has to in order to provide the protectiondetections it does and can BSOD Windows if it throws a page fault. This is both expect behavior and by design. Re my NHINBI research, Im just repeating what has been communicated to me via novel jailbreaks of one of the public LLMs. And even then, this was entirely in the scope of inquiring about this news article Im not the only one talking about this in public either So what Ive discovered is either real, a hallucination or somewhere inbetween. And even if it is real, all this stuff is going to be heavily restricted given our observer status so nobody on this planet is going to be an expert anytime soon. Im only publishing it here looking for thirdparty confirmation, which Ive gotten to a limited extent. So yes it makes sense that you also specialize in network forensics. Yes and Ive been recognized in this space as subject matter expert and been invited, multiple times, to speak at conferences sponsored by Google and Splunk on this topic. Both on this topic and designing, deploying and monitoring 10100G Suricata deployments. This can all be independently confirmed by simple Google search, much in the same way your shittay HCI research that nobody uses or cares about can. If I had to identify the biggest gap between your ears its your inability to appreciate that being an InfoSec professional means you need to know a little about a lot. So, understanding civilcriminal law is critical for pen testing to protect yourself and forensics proper evidence handlingchain of custody.

Reddit,2024-08-16,"The person you think I am is verifiably vastly more accomplished than youll ever verifiably be. Let me see, for starters PhD, MD, CEO. Dime. A. Dozen. And Im all the Clevels of my consulting business so that really doesnt mean jacksquat either. You can selfidentify as whatever you want. I was also frontrowcenter for the Bell LabsLucent implosion and at the time the Murray HIll location, where I worked, had the highest concentration of CompSci PhDs on the planet outside of potentially the NSA and those numbers are classified. None of that matters in emerging markets though of course, it usually doesnt hurt and is required in many professional spaces. Meanwhile the person youre pretending to be, flunked out of academia because you think youre smarter than all of them, when in reality they were all just sick of your selfimportant narcissitic bullshit, laughing at you behind your back. Actually, not unlike a lot of my contemporaries, I chose to leave academia in the 1990s because I felt there were more opportunities in the emerging Internet market vs. the traditional academic route. The Google founders walked away from their PhDs as well Stephan, are they failures too? Or more specifically, are you more successful than them? Ill also share that it was quite literally not possible to get a degree in cybersecurity or whatever you want to call it 30 years ago when I was an undergrad. And because I chose to leave school when I did I got to work with the original InfoSec team Bell Labs which is a quite literally irreplaceable experience. I am very lucky that my life turned out the way I did given the chances I took. You also seem to be missing that I spent many years doing systems engineering and security for a major research university and hospital system, so dipshit PiledHIgherDeeper dingleberries like yourself were my customers. And that is the environment I am happy to be out of. I mean they would have if it werent all fiction. You and everyone else browsing Reddit are using my contributions to the content delivery space, as Cloudflare is one of many vendors that have leveraged my inventions to serve content to a global audience. They have both cited my original patent which took 10 years to be granted, implemented and improved on it. This is site reliability engineering and as mentioned I teach a graduatelevel course on it for corporate client customers, not teenagers your customers. BTW you never did tell me about yourself. What are your dreams. Your goals. Where do you see yourself in 20 years? And with who? Who are you really, deepdown, in a human sense. Do you even know? I covered this in the podcast, but given you think Crowdstrike is called Cloudstrike its apparent that you are developmentally disabled to the point that even simple conversations are over your head. My original dreamgoal 30 years ago as an undergrad was to pursue a CSE degree and then do graduate work specifically with the goal of pursuing Artificial General Intelligence which is what OpenAIs goals are. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered two things. 1. Nobody had any idea how to do it and in some academic circles, even discussing got you labeled a crank and killed your funding. 2. I wrote a whitepaper, in 1993, that estimated the computational complexity of the human brain as exceeding an exaflop as a minimum and that supercomputers not PCs! were at least 2030 years away from being able to simulate that. Accounting for Moores Law. So, 1993 30 2023 and here we are, right on schedule. Isnt science amazing? 3. I still continued to follow the research and actively contributed to the late Chris McKinstry MindPixel opensource AGI project which ultimately failed and was abandoned. Then this happened... So, after 13 years, no measurable progress towards AGI and the suicide of two prominent researchers in quotes because neither of them actually produced anything that worked I decided to formally hang up my AGI hat and abandon it as a potential pursuit. That said, I still paid attention to the space AlphaGo was a big win for example and took a deep dive into LLMs in the Spring of 2023, which allowed me uncover OpenAIs secret frontier model. AGI and Aliens are the only two things on my bucket list before I shuffle off the ole mortal coil and for the first time in my life Im optimistic vs pessimistic on these topics.",Neutral,0,0.9970151484012604,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-16,"People who know what they are talking about never and I mean never just say page fault by itself, unless they are referring to the process of accessing virtual memory behind the scenes which is the almost universal context. If you meant a program generating an unhandled exception leading to a segfault, due to accessing memory they werent given access to by the OS, then anyone who knows what they are talking about, prepends invalid to page fault. But even then thats not really the language anyway, you sound like a noob. Heres a protip about yours truly. I never, ever, talk about anything unless I have checked my facts first. If you have ever done any Windows systems programming which I have and its obvious you havent, you would know they universally use that specific language in their kernel error codes. This is the error message from the Crowdstrike outage The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. Typically the memory address is wrong or the memory address is pointing at freed memory Source one of many and just the first hit I found Full list of BSOD error codes showing they exclusively use the language PAGE_FAULT when describing these cases This again shows your lack of even basic readinglanguage skills as an invalid page fault would be a doublenegative in this context and imply a valid access to memory. The correct usage would be A critical page fault kernel error is an invalid reference to system memory. Whereas an invalid page fault in a nonpaged area would be a valid reference to system memory. Im guessing you are so clueless that you dont understand the context of a PAGE FAULT has a different meaning when used in kernel error codes referencing nonpaged memory vs describing a page fault due to attempting to access virtual memory that has been swapped to disk. And these are logged as well as informational error codes. Ill add that a BSOD is desired behavior in this case as you dont want a bad kernel driver writing to random pages as that would lead to data corruption which is way worse. Second no, running in kernel space is not required. Running in user space and communicating with an OSprovided service running in kernel space made for that purpose, is the much safer albeit marginally slower way to do it. You are the posterboy for the DunningKruger Effect as you have just transparently telegraphed to me that you have literally zero experience working on forensic investigations involving APT threat actors or even have any experience working with NextGen EDR clients. Including specifically Crowdstrike, as they in particular do not market to zeroes like yourself. You dont know what the software actually does because you have never used it. First of all, Crowdstrike isnt exclusively an antivirus product. It operates as a kernel mode rootkit by design, as it can be configured to log extensive system information about all running processes. Such system calls, disknetwork access, etc. Second, you are absolutely, 100 correct that Microsoft could expose a safe usermode API to allow a system process running as Administrator to access all the same information. However, there is a big problem with that because the bad guys in general and APT actors in particular will write kernelmode rootkits that not only can trivially evade usermode detectionlogging, they can actively spoof systems calls and replace error codes see StuxNet for example. So instead of disabling the usermode EDR product which could be detected, they could hijack it and inject whatever they want via their kernel rootkit. So do shut up already with your droning claims of expertise already and go get a macbook, it will protect you from running thirdparty stuff in kernel mode by default. I think you need that. Already have one and I hate to break it to you but the vast majority of InfoSec peeps run nix. Either OsX or Linux.

But the necessary paperwork for that temporary door plug removal was apparently never created. So when workers replaced the door plug temporarily, other workers were unaware that bolts needed to be reinstalled, said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Ive worked at MRO facilities that help repair the planes at the airports when the airliners want to save money, instead of getting the manufacturer like embraer or boeing to repair it. There are numerous issues in my brief stint there, but they are similar to the first rollout when the plane is being built. There is a lack of talented blue collar workers to do the repairsinstall because they are underpaid and literally undocumented hispanic workers. The actual MODMRB engineers that do the analysis are understaffed but typically have to be on call whenever a plane is grounded. The Damage tolerance team is on call basically 247 with rotating shifts and regularly gets woken up to handle shit. There is not enough organization in documentation and SOP to do the repair according to a manual. Especially when every airline has their own manual that they want you to download from airbus world but the manual is just a scanned pdf with no ctrlf capabilities whatsoever. Everyone is just out for themselves, trying to do the least amount of work as possible, while goofing off, and just caring about blowing their next pitiful paycheck on some fds or something. This creates a culture of keeping your head down and not caring about documentation, and definitely not trying to improve something when there is a deficiency in accountability.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"I work in the aerospace industry and its completely believable. The amount of times things that should be traceable are not is way too often. The amount of times Ive been presented with incomplete paperwork and am told just BS it is also way too high. A lot of management at other companies just dont care because the necessary papertrail requires a ton of time and slows every aspect of production down. We get audited annually but the audits dont do any digging. They ask for a random batch of jobs and as long as everything is filled out they assume it was done properly meaning the individual process and inspection steps on the travelers are filled out and complete prior to that part moving on to the next step. People are lazy and dont care and since there is no accountability its becoming common work culture to just BS the papertrail. FAA parts have such high requirements that if a door fell off a boeing jet 5 years after it was built the FAA should be able to reach out to boeing and know within a day exactly who had hands on that part, for what step, and at exactly what time, from the first ply of material to the last nut and bolt every single aspect of the manufacturing of that part is supposed to be recording. The FAA expects to be able to point a very accurate finger at the exact person responsible for that step anytime something goes wrong. For example if I forgot to install a bolt the papertrail would say that and myself and the QA inspector responsible could potentially be sued by the FAA or criminally charged for not adhering to their policies. The fact they cant provide this is insane to me. Weve had failures that the FAA has reached out to us about and within a few minutes of pulling the paper work we are able to tell them every single piece of information they want. Its an obnoxious amount of paperwork and a real hassle but when it comes to commercial aircraft its pretty fucking necessary.

I mean at the end of the day Xilinx is selling itselfif it were a big deal, Xilinx would be buying others, not selling itself. Also, Xilinx used to have a competitor in the adaptive computing space, called Altera. They got bought at some point because business was not so greatdespite the fact that I distinctly recall Altera made better products than Xilinx imho EDIT Just went and looked, Altera was founded in 1983, which means that adaptive computing has been failing to make a significant impact for a full 40 years.

An other missed bullet point is chiplets! AMD has a lot of experience with chiplets and advanced packaging, and now they are using it on GPUs as well This is the thing Nvidia struggles with, given that the B200 is delayed because of packaging problems.

Just a few years ago it was 2 a share. Its very hard to value that company. Its not really a pro or con or anything else its just one of the many tickers I would avoid but thats just me. Also if youre looking for more tech exposure, why bother when you have ASML, KLAC, NVDA. Depending on how cheap AMD gets you might have an argument for it but its very much in a weekly downtrend. Maybe it puts in a bottom with this test of the 21 month? if it does you need to see it start trading above 145 consistently and moving higher.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Yes, the use of chiplets in AMDs MI300 design is a significant factor in enabling the production of advanced chips without substantially increasing the complexity of the packaging. Heres how chiplets contribute to this advantage 1. Modular Design Chiplets allow AMD to design and manufacture smaller, modular components that can be combined into a single package. This modularity simplifies the design process because each chiplet can be optimized individually. 2. Yield Improvement Manufacturing smaller chiplets can lead to higher yields compared to producing a single large monolithic die. This is because defects in smaller chiplets affect a smaller portion of the overall product, reducing waste and costs. 3. Scalability Chiplets enable AMD to scale performance by adding more chiplets to a package, allowing them to create more powerful chips without designing entirely new monolithic dies. This approach offers flexibility in meeting different performance and power requirements. 4. Integration of Different Technologies With chiplets, AMD can integrate different types of technologies e.g., CPU, GPU, memory, specialized accelerators within a single package. This heterogenous integration can enhance performance and efficiency while keeping packaging complexity manageable. 5. Interconnect Efficiency Advanced interconnect technologies like AMDs Infinity Fabric allow chiplets to communicate efficiently with each other, maintaining high performance while simplifying the design of the interconnects within the package. 6. Cost and Time Efficiency By reusing existing chiplet designs and integrating them into new products, AMD can reduce both the cost and time required to bring new products to market. This approach leverages existing investments in design and manufacturing processes. Overall, the chiplet approach enables AMD to create advanced, highperformance chips like the MI300 while maintaining manageable levels of packaging complexity, improving yields, and offering greater flexibility and scalability.",Positive,1,0.9999992847442627,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-06,"Great read. Thanks for the effort you put in this. Your point about uranium needing to be more expensive to justify seawater extraction made me google the current price and it looks kinda bullish. 124 price increase in the last 4 years, though still well below the ATH of 2007. On a similar topic, I have a similar feeling about copper. Although I have yet to put as much elbow grease on the topic as you did on uranium, I get the impression that as we move to a more electrified future, a few extra stretches of copper wire are going to be needed, even regardless of the energy source.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"Nice market analysis for uranium. Any energy source will undoubtedly be valuable especially one as seemingly magical as nuclear. Oil cartels will remain king however. Oil products have completely consumed the global market. This doesnt take much away from nuclear.. just that uranium isnt as versatile as oil. Until we learn how to secondarily use depleted Uranium besides using it to fucking blast the planetkill people arguably the most profitable thing but I digress I dont think it will reach the prestigepower of oil think of plastics, gas, rubber, roads, etc. I think thats what really limits the potential of uranium, the fact that we have to store it I believe theres now safe depleted uraniums but I forget the names. Either way its almost useless What Im saying is, we need a more vitaldynamic use for uranium daily besides energy. For now its just a fancy coal. I hope to see a future where we have totally stable nuclear and have nuclear powered things that can quantum compute things our mind cant even comprehend. Big oil would probably shoot that down anyways though. Rather profit off our lack of societal progression.
