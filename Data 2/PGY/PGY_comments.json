Or expressing it the other way around, the notes can be redeemed as early as Oct. 5, 2027, for cash if the stock price exceeds that price threshhold. Otherwise, the holders of the notes are entitled to hold them for the full five years and then the notes will be payable in cash with the option for the company to pay in unregistered shares if it chooses."

However, the volume today was an all time record for this stock, which wasn&#39;t overbought to begin with.  And the news is not devastating like a massive dilution.  It&#39;s taking on exchangeable debt that unlike a convertible debt is under the control of the company as to how much they payback with cash and how much with stock for the next 3 years.  This gives them much-needed flexibility to manage their cash flows, some breathing space, if you will, to expand the network.  You see, the problem is their margins are so thin, they have to make up for it in volume.  But to scale up, they must retain more and more (in terms of dollars) on their balance sheet, which right now, they have to borrow, which cuts into their margins.  So they need some flexibility in financing which puts them in a much better position in ramping up the volume, without diluting shares in the near-term, if at all.  This exchangeable debt does that.  The market over-reacted to the news as if it was an immediate stock dilution.  Perfect opportunity to buy in.  Tomorrow morning may see some further downdraft.  Hoping it goes below $9 so I can buy some more.  Might churn throughout the day at lower volume but by Monday, should see a bounce back."

Did move their HQ to the US but still a risk with the tech people in Israel possibly going to war.  However, I do think they are making very solid strategic moves on the funding front, carefully avoiding the debacle of diluting shares made earlier after the reverse split.  Just take a deep breath and think about it.  They are firmly  entrenched in the lenders&#39; computer systems with their API&#39;s, providing an opportunity for the lenders to retain customers while at the same time, offload their risk.  Why would a lender not sign up for this service and even expand it across their entire loan portfolio?  They have US Bank and CitiBank on board, 2 of the top 5 banks.  It won&#39;t be long before Bank of America and Wells Fargo join them.  JP Morgan as well.  Hang tight.  It&#39;s rare that you get a shot at an AI company at these prices, and without the large language model computational requirements that are a huge capital expense if not IT expense.  Once they go cash flow positive, profits will start to multiply exponentially.  They are in the network growth phase."

That allows it to be able to package those loans into ABS and issue them while it collects fees on both ends of the financing.  With great demand, it has reduced its own money in each deal which lowers the risk to PGY and provides a third source of income. Today&#39;s reaction is overdone by those who fail to understand that the new notes are essentially designed to prevent any dilution.  It is likely no shares will ever be issued.  The company controls whether it pays the debt in shares and those shares are not eligible to be listed for trading in the public market.  Private purchasers of this debt must have full confidence in getting paid back.  Otherwise, they would not invest but they are prepared to accept payment in non-tradeable shares if the company chooses to pay them off that way.  If it does not have the cash or ability to place more debt at that time, it insures there is no possibility of an actual default.  If shares were issued, the company would have a plan to redeem them at some point as the holders have no practical way to sell them except to another private buyer.  Ultimately, there is no dilution to the float of its shares.  Any &#34;dilution&#34; for accounting purposes would be temporary and minimal."

It&#39;s actually a smart move, but the market usually kills the company&#39;s stock any time there&#39;s any kind of offering, giving me the opportunity to buy at a huge discount.

Their ill-timed action in raising funds have proven to be consistent including the secondary offering upon its reverse split coupled with its move to NYC.  That offering also stopped its upward rmomentum on the track leading to all time low.  Just when you think things have finally settled with Feds rate cut leading to a most favorable climate for this stock, the managemet did it again.\nWhether this announcement entails dilution or not, the fact it was so ill-written for the announcement to be interpreted differently by readers reflect the failing of this management."

When the news came out, the stock dropped to its low at 5:11 pm of $ 10.11 on only 7000 shares. No big blocks traded. Can anyone show me one stock that dropped 20% in 41 minutes on no volume and not one big block. Then to top it off, we start off this morning with only 34,000 shares traded with no big blocks. I think management better clarify what is going on before class action law suits start up"

Personally I think they&#39;re on the right track, and the current movement really means nothing, up or down. When they do reach profitability, I honestly believe this would be the final needed proof that they&#39;re doing it right, that their moves and the deals signed are bearing fruit, and at that point, the stock will not only double itself, it will quadruple. One can hope :)"

KBW highlights the same. Felt the quarter was &#34;solid&#34; and if they had to &#34;pick&#34; one thing it was the impairment. KBW highlights that mngt believes this isn&#39;t ongoing and proof of that is their guidance that 2025 will be GAAP net income positive. If they were to have more large impairments you can&#39;t be GAAP net income positive. On-going impairments would make that impossible. Many have asked why the sell off post earnings. Here is KBW&#39;s thoughts. &#34;Why Such a Sharp Sell-off in PGY? We did not get a lot of investor feedback one way or the other on the stock and quarter, which suggests to us this was mainly profit- taking, with the stock having been up 18% since mid-June.&#34; KBW Bottom-Line With the stock having round-tripped since June (after being up over 18%), we think the entry point presently is attractive for the shares. In the two months since we initiated coverage, PGY has only furthered its model in terms of its partnerships on both sides of its model, achieved AAA rating on securitizations (helping capital efficacy) and accomplished the key goal of self-funding its growth. Additionally, with interest rates on the cusp of decline, that should add to the attractiveness of PGY’s loan sales. Reiterate OP rating.&#34;"

I still believe Pagaya has great prospects, especially if they can turn this growth into profit in the near term. I will likely sell off my shares into the Q3 earnings and wait a few days to re enter (if growth prospects and balance sheet continues to improve). I’m hoping institutional ownership of Pagaya really picks up in the next 6 months or so, getting bored of these erratic price swings lol. Would be interested to hear from fellow investors."
