Yahoo,2024-09-26,"Shares at these prices are an absolute steal for one of the largest if not the largest company providing AI software to boost the amount of loans approved for customers of various businesses along with a remarkable track record of lowering loss ratios on those loans.  That allows it to be able to package those loans into ABS and issue them while it collects fees on both ends of the financing.  With great demand, it has reduced its own money in each deal which lowers the risk to PGY and provides a third source of income. Today&#39;s reaction is overdone by those who fail to understand that the new notes are essentially designed to prevent any dilution.  It is likely no shares will ever be issued.  The company controls whether it pays the debt in shares and those shares are not eligible to be listed for trading in the public market.  Private purchasers of this debt must have full confidence in getting paid back.  Otherwise, they would not invest but they are prepared to accept payment in non-tradeable shares if the company chooses to pay them off that way.  If it does not have the cash or ability to place more debt at that time, it insures there is no possibility of an actual default.  If shares were issued, the company would have a plan to redeem them at some point as the holders have no practical way to sell them except to another private buyer.

Felt the quarter was &#34;solid&#34; and if they had to &#34;pick&#34; one thing it was the impairment. KBW highlights that mngt believes this isn&#39;t ongoing and proof of that is their guidance that 2025 will be GAAP net income positive. If they were to have more large impairments you can&#39;t be GAAP net income positive. On-going impairments would make that impossible. Many have asked why the sell off post earnings. Here is KBW&#39;s thoughts. &#34;Why Such a Sharp Sell-off in PGY? We did not get a lot of investor feedback one way or the other on the stock and quarter, which suggests to us this was mainly profit- taking, with the stock having been up 18% since mid-June.&#34; KBW Bottom-Line With the stock having round-tripped since June (after being up over 18%), we think the entry point presently is attractive for the shares. In the two months since we initiated coverage, PGY has only furthered its model in terms of its partnerships on both sides of its model, achieved AAA rating on securitizations (helping capital efficacy) and accomplished the key goal of self-funding its growth. Additionally, with interest rates on the cusp of decline, that should add to the attractiveness of PGY‚Äôs loan sales. Reiterate OP rating.&#34;",Positive,1,0.9993531107902527,Main
