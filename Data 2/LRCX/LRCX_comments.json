But I reserve the right to adjust depending on how it goes after the earnings call this coming week on 102324. These last few months have not been kind and I am not smart enough to figure out the why they are down after having such a bullish last 18 months.

I truly debated on selling but ended up buying more in the mid 30s thats where I truly accumulated my long position. Ive grabbed more here and there over the last 2 years after a big dip. I may be day dreaming or wishful thinking or what ever the right naivete descriptor fits. But I am still long on this one. YMMV! Happy to see the bounce tonight after hours.

Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks."

Its amazing how sensitive messages are when I hear somebody say something wrong. Lam has taken quite a beating since its split and the negative news from ASML. I guess ASML 2025 projections are off. Maybe the whole story is that it lost market share to LRCX based in Silicon Valley. LRCX could turn upside down after earnings idk but I think this maybe an opportunity for an unexpected pop.

Margins and costs pretty stable. Only 17% of rev to US and EU. 37% to China, 18% to Korea. As goes TSM and Samsung...so goes LRCX. Notably, ASML growth has been curtailed by China trade restrictions and its likely a matter of time that LRCX follows suit as nationalism increases. Will be interesting to chart geographic revenue distribution going forward, assuming good data can be had. When this AI capex cycle matures, LRCX will not be a good place to be regardless of geographics. To find that in LRCX customer financials, you will have to dig really deep into managements discussion of financial results, and that is a game of hide and seek that I am not very experienced with. In the meantime, I&#39;ll take the win with a suspicious eye. I&#39;m thinking chip makers will stop spending 3-4 qtr next year."

If we get a return to 33X forward earnings, we&#39;re looking at $1,500.

Ignoring the potential negatives from that conflict, we are on a perfect trajectory for steady growth with low inflation. Another looming factor is the increased value of the Japanese yen against the dollar. I am pleasantly surprised that Powell cut the full half point. The build out on chips will benefit. Lam and Micron are must own long stocks. The initial reaction lower should reverse tomorrow IMHO. Labor will see pressure from AI efficiency gains but I believe lower rates will stabilize the economy and it will be a long glide path with a Goldilocks effect the entire way. I bought the dip and will hold long without loss of sleep."

I am not saying a limit buy there will fill but it could. Barring catastrophic events, the upcoming split is likely to solidify support above that range soon. It is still early but shorts will be pressed to cover. If so the chart will tell the tale and resistance looks like $800ish for now IMHO. Resistance will likely become support in days ahead. I think we see better than $850 pre split but what do I know?"

NVLS ran from about 20 after the attack to about 55 in 6 months before that money ran out. You have lost your objectivity about the election so I won’t elaborate further. Best as always. Tj."

This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like LRCX to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax LRCX would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of LRCX stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on LRCX stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on LRCX stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset. If the brackets sunset and increase to the pre-2017 levels, so too would the cap-gains tax with Harris&#39;s proposal."

China may be front loading to get ahead of new restrictions thus the risk of that revenue dropping. But I think it’s dropped enough so I bought. If it drops further I’ll buy more. GLTA"

Shares of semiconductor stocks are declining in response to Intel Corp’s weaker-than-expected second-quarter financial results.Intel shares are down some 27% Friday morning following disappointing second-quarter results and the announcement of a 15% workforce reduction and dividend suspension.This slump is part of Intel&#39;s broader struggle to compete with leading chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. and if the losses persist, the company&#39;s market capitalization could drop to about $100 billion. Intel is one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers, and it is a significant customer for many suppliers in the semiconductor industry, including Lam Research (LRCX). A substantial decline in Intel&#39;s profitability or a reduction in its capital expenditure could lead to a decrease in orders from Intel. This could impact Lam Research&#39;s (LRCX) revenue and potentially its profitability.Intel’s financial strain could raise concerns about the financial health of its suppliers and partners. If Intel is experiencing difficulties, investors might worry that other companies in its supply chain, including Lam Research (LRCX), could also face financial stress or reduced business opportunities."

Nor did Gelsinger sticking his nose up Biden’s butt at State of the Union. \n\nA few years ago I read a biographical interview of Morris Chang in which he says he wanted to found TSMC in the USA but that he concluded that it was not economically feasible here. I assume that he was referring to (at least in part) the corporate tax structure, which at the time was 39% here, highest in the world but for France. Trump tax reform in 2017 reduced the corp tax rate to 19%, which got many companies to return corporate citizenship and cash stored overseas to the USA. I recall subsequent events in which LRCX repatriated their overseas cash hoard causing a major runup in stock valuation, which continued until 3 weeks ago. So I guess it is the Democrats fault, at least indirectly.\n\nAnybody backing the Dems this time around should consider the massive tax increases that they will impose. (Kamala is even farther left than Senile Joe.) They have already imposed a tax on dividend distributions in the form of stock buybacks. Watch out for their wealth tax and particularly their plans to annually tax unrealized capital gains. I used to be a Dem but the current crop of leftists running the party are crazy Marxists who never bothered to take an econ class. \n\nJust my opinions of course."

Lam says it will be much busier in &#39;25. Anyone following these stocks for a while knows that, in &#39;23, everyone said that &#39;24 would be a crazy ramp (can you say AI?) and the stocks ramped in anticipation of that, but it hasn&#39;t panned out yet. If Applied $amat just slightly beats and guides soft it could get much uglier. I just wonder where all this capex money is going. You are not making chips without equipment."
