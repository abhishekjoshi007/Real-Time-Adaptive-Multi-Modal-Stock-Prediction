Reddit,2024-08-01,"Your table is missing a key piece of data, analysts usually give 12 month price targets, so how accurate did the analysts price turn out to be 12 months later? Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks.",Neutral,0,0.6505180597305298,Reply

Yahoo,2024-10-23,"Liked the results but a very Asia centric biz, discounting that TSM based revenue from EU and US buildout that we hear so much about is probably allocated to ASIA on LRCX financials. Margins and costs pretty stable. Only 17% of rev to US and EU. 37% to China, 18% to Korea. As goes TSM and Samsung...so goes LRCX. Notably, ASML growth has been curtailed by China trade restrictions and its likely a matter of time that LRCX follows suit as nationalism increases. Will be interesting to chart geographic revenue distribution going forward, assuming good data can be had. When this AI capex cycle matures, LRCX will not be a good place to be regardless of geographics. To find that in LRCX customer financials, you will have to dig really deep into managements discussion of financial results, and that is a game of hide and seek that I am not very experienced with.

So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on LRCX stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed.
