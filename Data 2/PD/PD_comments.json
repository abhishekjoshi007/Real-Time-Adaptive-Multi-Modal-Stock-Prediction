How is it that IBRXs accumulated deficit of 3.2 billion is more than half of SoonShiongs net worth, if he didnt deliberately saddle it with debt Im not saying he did Im just asking? 2. If IBRX only has enough cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through at least 12 months, doesnt that mean a share dilution is very likely in the near future? Wouldnt IBRX be cutting things a bit close if they dont do it within the next 3 months? 3. The stock price is lower today than it was when the FDA approval was given. What does this mean for sales? Does it for example mean that other drugs are being preferred, over Anktiva? Does it mean that Anktivas efficacy has been exaggerated, since its not effective on its own but has to be taken alongside BCG? 4. Which other drugs are competing with Anktiva in the treatment of NMIBC, and how do their sales compare with those of Anktiva? 5. Are there any official dates or timelines by which UK approval is expected? 6. You say his plane has been at Heathrow Airport for this month. Is it likely that he is pushing for UK approval, so he can then announce some shares dilution?"

Trials are extremely expensive, I believe 505k 150k per participant., depending on the type of drugtreatment. 2. Yes. Share dilution is possible. However, it is my opinion the will partner to create liquidity. Soon owns 80 of the stock, so he has in interest too. 3. Look at Akebia, Iovance, Coherus, Xfor and others that had PDUFAapproval. Approval means nothing, IBRX was in the luxury position of being able to ship 2 weeks after approval. Unique. However, the market still needs to be informed, trained, insurance deals covered. An approval, as with the given examples, are in indication of future value. Especially when it does not concern Big Pharma. 4. Keytruda and Opdivo I believe. If you look at Opdivo wiki, you can see a approval path I think Anktiva has the same timeline. 5. UK is my guess. Not fact. It is simply logic. The fastest to obtain. 6. UK approval, in my opinion, will go with a partnership. I do not see how they can not. If they do not partner, they will need to dilute. With Bio stock anything is possible. You have to be willing to see red. A partner can bee in many forms, but if this occurs there will be a big investment my guess 500,000,000 minimum and hefty milestone payments for each indication."

If dilution would take place, I am guessing a direct placement. Oberman also has a massive interest 200 million and I am sure there are some negatives to be found in sec filing. I do however believe, based on Soon his business record, he knows how to drive value, and chose the opportune moment to act. Note the strategic move to use India to resolve a global shortage. This nugget is glanced over easily. Also, he clearly is a philanthropist, his age 73 or so, I think this is his legacy no way no how he is going to let that go bankrupt or be spoiled by monetary issues."

They are an obvious candidate, but immunitybio has secured a deal with the serum institute of India and is filing for phase 3 for non small cell lung cancer as per news today.

If by bio business you mean biotechs as a whole, well nobody is ever going to be familiar with all of them, and each biotech has its own idiosyncracies and unique selling points. Therefore, we ALL need to read about bio business. Also, as far as getting familiar is concerned, asking questions here is actually part of getting familiar with the sector and learning more about it. Nobody has a monopoly on knowledge. 2 Big Pharma and biotechs are not the same thing. A financial win for a Biotech company may barely move the financial needle for a Big Pharma company thats worth multiples of billions, depending on the amount of sales of the drug. If a biotechs drug is not the only drug on the market for a given illness, the money made from that drugs market share will be limited, since the Total Addressable Market will be shared with the competing drugs. There are also drugs that most of the public who need them will never see, due to the unfortunate fact that those drugs are too expensive to be massproduced for the wider market. 3 A companys revenue is very different from its stock price action. Even when a drug is sold to the public, it isnt guaranteed to translate to significant stock price increase. If a biotechs stock price doesnt move much, then that biotech isnt attractive to private investors, even if it remains desirable for a big pharma company to invest in it."

IBRX is up 4 today it was 9.2 at one point lets see whether the stock price increase holds.

I was scared of their market data fees, but havent notice an impact at all. Plus, the interest they pay on cash negated the cost for me. They do a free trial.
