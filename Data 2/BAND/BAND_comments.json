Outside of the poor decision to pay so much for HD, the business is still strong and they are positioning Hey Dude for positive impact long term. They are focusing on DTC for Hey Dude similar to Crox which is a strategy that has increased gross margins and brand loyaltyengagement and to me is a better measure of consumer demand. The of revenue thats DTC for Hey Dude has gone from about 30 to nearly 44 TTM. DTC revenue is only down about 9 while the big majority of HDs revenue drops are from wholesalers. With Hey Dudes branding it makes way more sense for them to focus on digital marketingsales and DTC. Their strategy is not off it will just take time after they pretty much completely reset the Hey Dude strategy a year ago. My biggest gripe with CROX right now is the ballooning SGA expenses. I hope that gets sorted out because they had it down to about 27 of revenue but now its gone back up to 34 of revenue. That needs to slow down, which I think it will. The combination of Hey Dude stabilizing, SGA growth slowing, and a reduced interest expense could give CROX a huge profit boost even without much revenue growth from the crocs brand. Those things are really masking the big gross margin gains over this same period. The bears are constantly waiting for Crocs brand to fall and prove its a fad and the Bulls are waiting for Hey Dude to stop contracting so much and start recovering but the results just kind of keep happening somewhere in the middle. Enough in either direction that you can convince yourself of whatever you want. I increased my CROX share count by a measly 3 today, will probably buy more if it drops another 4 or 5. My long term thesis in the business model of Crox hasnt really changed since I first bought shares in 2020."

Different capital allocation. Company is already paying large dividends share buybacks. Stock is extremely cheap. Does activist want more buybacks? Or less buybacks for more RD? Seems like what an activist can do is create a bunch of near term cost efficiencies, change up the CEO apparently that always excites the market.

Historically used homes make up a vast majority of the housing market and because of the high rates and low inventory, new homes actually have been selling at higher rates. Also, new home builders can offer things like mortgage buy downs to draw people in. We are still going to need to build a ton of housing, just as rates go lower in the future and more used inventory becomes available, people will probably buy less new homes. Not saying home builders are a bad investment, just my fear is that theyve hit their peak in terms how much units they historically move. This spring, new home sales are a more important part of the market than they would be in a more typical year, says Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist for Bright MLS. In April, new singlefamily home sales were about 14 of total home sales nationwide. Typically, sales of new singlefamily homes account for less than 10 of all sales transactions, and the last time the new home share was this high was back in 2005."

But lets be real here, we all know prices have increased more than 16.8 in that timeframe. This is especially true when you look at the cost of housing, insurance, food, automobiles, etc. Your example of a sandwich costing 3 more isnt an accurate representation of the true cost of inflation. Even if you accept the governments numbers, which are woefully inaccurate, you still have to accept that inflation compounds on existing inflation.

There are a lot of vagueness and optionality in GAAP standards that leads to companies producing incomparable 10Qs. Not only are the likes of FNV, KGC, GOLD, WPM, NEM, etc. overpriced compared to smaller companies along several valuation metrics, but theyre also less efficient in asset usage and have weaker earnings projections YoY percentage wise as well.

Their growth will always be lumpy as a result of the capital demands imposed on their supplierscustomers, but it is slowly changing as servicing increases on these machines, and EUV begins to display the companys pricing power. The issue at hand is that many industries are going through a downturn, and the pull forward many of us thought would come from automotive and industrials has been delayed.

I guess my stance is based on the question, Why buy a gold stock over holding physical gold? The metal has no counterparty risk and no exogenous threats can depreciate its value. Youll never have a Victoria Gold situation where your investment is wiped out by one bad day or a legal decision in its jurisdiction. Since gold as an asset fluctuates so violently throughout the decades, the companies are not stable longterm investments either. The big ones have regularly lost 7090 of their stock value at the nadir of cycles and stayed there for years. There are two main justifications IMO Arbitrage between the current price and its current worthfuture potential. According to whatever personal thesis you have regarding golds future price, the disparity should widen appropriately. At heart its value investing and you wait while investors reprice the company accordingly. The passive leverage inherent in a gold companys operations. For the right companies, a 20 rise in golds value can result in 3x profit margins and 4x FCF. With that philosophy, youre treating it as a growth company. With the exception of Agnico Eagle and Northern Star, the big companies dont fit the GARP profile and theyre way too expensive to be value plays. In terms of capital efficiency, some of the junior miners run circles around them I think there are at least 45 with triple digit returns on capitalassets while the biggest companies are stuck between 10 and negative levels. This isnt due to bad management e.g. FNV has a stellar team but their asset portfolios and how regional regulations costs are creating high AISC barriers. Right now, the largecap royalty companies are stuck with a lot of suboptimal mines in jurisdictions that are expensive to operate in. Thats the big impetus behind their recent MA plays. However, most of those have run by the looks of their charts. Still not badly priced though.... RGLD is around 16x PE with a projected 50 EPS increase next year. With its main projects coming online, SANDs EPS will triple in 2025 and compress the multiple down to 89x. I think they have a lot of room to run, and theyre not even the best in their field."

It might be a value trap....or it could be a really interesting royalty play. I recall my first impression was that it was not worth investing in for the backend of 2024. Granite Ridge management had announced plans to bump up the development capex budget by 60 million and the acquisitions capex budget by 25 million, with the investment bearing fruit in early 2025. They were guiding towards doubledigit growth in Q1 Q2 2025 as opposed to mid and high singledigit from sellside. While thats encouraging if one had bought in during 2023, it probably means restricted FCF for Q3 Q4 and an uptick in credit utilization to 7585 of their facility. My price target was, uh checks backlog 7.507.75. I didnt see any discussion about controlling distribution or extending royalty rights to other asset classes, which caps their upside."

But, since you seem to know it so well, can you enlighten me to the BRKA volume change since June? What does this massive shift in liquidity mean for Buffetts future success? He must be very focused on this metric...since it is so critical... Nice try. You know as well as I do thats a trick question. There is no meaningful volume change in BRK.A. exchange volume since June, and there never has been since the preGFC era. May had the highest average exchange rate in 16 years at 13k that doesnt even reach 1 of all 1.5 million outstanding Class A shares which have not materially changed in 40 years. A significant percentage of that volume consisted of buying back shares too. You can see the historical paucity of volume right here As Class A shares were intended for founding investors and management, they will always have a far lower outstanding shareexchange volume ratio than common stock. This is no different than preferred shares. The comparison is a hilarious false equivalence, especially when BRK.B is fairly healthy in this department."

It gives me little pleasure to say that considering Nvidia is one of the greatest companies in the world."

In the shorterterm though, Im concerned that theres a lot of people who are newer to investing who regard declines like this as something that results in considering whether to own the stock. Daytoday volatility like this even if theres not news is sort of the price of admission to owning something like NVDA. If you own something like NVDA for a long enough time youre going to probably see another large drawdown wasnt that long ago when it was down 65 from the 2021 top to the 2022 bottom before the AI theme started up. An off day or rotationflows out of technology might easily be a down 2 day for something like NVDA. There is negative news, but Im not selling technology based upon that. The whole market is down and unless you have names that are beneficiaries or things that manage to bounce, many names are going to be down on a day like today. I dont mean this as a bullishbearishwhatever post, just saying that 2.8 decline in NVDA is something that people have to get used to if theyre going to own growth stocks for any material length of time. If your thesis changes on the name itself, then reconsider owning but selling it solely because its down 2.8 off some broader negative news? I wouldnt recommend it. The market isnt really down much at all a 10 decline used to be viewed as a healthy correction but if it does go further South then you have your shopping list and look for opportunities."

Theyre a streamer, not a miner so there is a lot less volatility there though also less upside. Also, they got decimated by the shit down of one of their streams, the Cobre Panama mine, which was nearly 20 of their business. However, thats now priced in. So they are a company that has fantastic margins, can generally compound at a mid teens rate, and had the added upside potential of Cobre Panama coming back online. Interesting play. Also, I did grab a starter in ACIC, which I hope to expand some over the coming days. The closer to Halloween end of peak hurricane season, the better the odds are on that one."

Youre already seeing concern over residential power supply in some areas with data centers popping up and it seems like were in early innings of this intended buildout. It will also realistically take a long time for these projects to come online a lot can happen in the meantime. Id like to think that prices will somehow come down because of this, but more likely think that theyre going up. Was an interview late last year with former Fidelity manager Jeff Vinik talking about how he thinks electrification is going to be one of the big themes of the next decade and that electricity prices are going up 50 over the next 10 years. Clearly, mega cap tech wants to spend, has the ability to and while there is some skepticism there is nothing material at this point. If you build it they will come and they probably will, but if the AI bubble fadesunderwhelmswhatever and massive capacity is built youre not going to want to own tech for a while. Not an applestoapples comparison, but there were at least a few large life science companies that indicated that added covid capacity could be repurposed for other things and that there was demand to meet that. There was not. Those names have yet to get back to 2021 levels and in some cases 2020 levels. And yes, I am long the AI theme power theme."

A severe crash just after purchasing could leave you worse off 510 years later than if you just bought a non leveraged etf. Also, individual risk tolerance is a big factor. A lot of people think theyll be ok when markets crash, but they totally arent and are often tempted to sell at the worst times high fear, bottom of the market. This is heightened with leveraged products. Imagine seeing a 100k portfolio turn into 8000!

But, on the upside, they reported a net income of 14.8M versus a loss last year. Their strategy? Theyre closing underperforming stores and optimizing operations to boost profitability. Plus, theyve got a new investment policy led by Ryan Cohen, aiming to maximize shareholder value. So, while the dip might seem like a red flag, it could actually be a good entry point if youre a longterm believer. Dive deeper into the details here"

Revenue Quality is unstable, think project delays and supply chain issues bogging things down. Profitability? Practically nonexistent at the moment. Heavy losses with deep negative margins. The Outlook is mixed. Some potential growth opportunities, but theyve got serious existing hurdles to clear. Their Track Record shows volatile stock performance and underperformance in sales. Theres some Management Alignment with the CEO investing personal capital, but they need to show more longterm commitment. Their Capital Allocation strategy could use a lot of improvement, too dependent on debt and diluting shareholders without strong returns.

Which is because large cap companies refinanced when rates bottomed during Covid. And profits are only increasing nominally, as I will soon demonstrate. Forward earnings do not expect 300 growth in profits that is false. No, youre just unfamiliar with the numbers. Bloomberg analyst consensus estimated SP 500 Index earnings will end 2024 at 245, 2025 at 278, and 2026 at 302. This is equivalent to 9.7, 13.7, and 8.6 YoY respectively for an average of 10.3 growth per year. This is high but not implausible earnings growth tends to vary quite a bit over the shortterm. The problem is how the composition of said earnings would have to shake out. CPI inflation is expected to moderate towards its historical mean between 2024 and 2026, while real sales are projected to be slightly below the 25year average. Bloombergs model of future SP index earnings growth looks like this Nominal EPS growth 10.3 Real EPS 8.0 CPI YoY 2.3 Real Sales per Share 1.5 Real Earnings per Share 8.0 Real SP Profit Margin 6.5 Notably average profit margin growth from 20002024 is only 1.7. So yes, growth in profit margins is expected to increase around 300 of the historical mean over the next three years. Thus far companies are still delivering incredible growth. It really is not a bubble. As Ive tiresomely reminded people over and over again during the summer, real SP earnings have been rangebound essentially flat over the last 2 years At the end of the Q2 earnings season, Bloomberg revised from their yearlong SP earnings estimate from 243 to 240.64 and the Nasdaq dropped 3 to 663.13. The SPs drop was attributed to shrinking profit margins 13 12.9. Most analyst estimates concerning 20242026 earnings are erroneously based on the assumption 2022 was the new normal when it was just an aberration of fiscal policy. For example, EBIT margins are expected to grow to 18 by 2026 and stay there despite EBIT margins being 13 for the last two decades. EBIT margins reached 16 in 2022 but this was accomplished with 20 YoY nominal sales growth, which was boosted by 9 inflation. The same analysts expect sales growth to shrink in 2025 and rebound to 6 in 2026."

Apollo already cut a 5050 deal for an oversees deal, and private capital could be a modest savior for a company that might cease to exist in all but brand name, but the brand name is part of the book value. The thing is, designing a chip or a fabrication facility that makes a single thing, is a whole lot different from designing a fab that is already way behind schedule and might get off the ground by 2027, which is an eternity in AI years. What experience does Intel have working with lots of companies to secretly get their custom chips off the ground while making their own supposedly according to the CEO groundbreaking AI CPUs? TSMC is probably out because of the antitrust proAmerican, were going to build our own supply chains zeitgeist. Any company that sets itself up to compete with TSMC years from now, if they succeed, is stuck with the fact that they need TSMC now, when TSMC can pick and choose customers they want at the front of the line for advanced chips currently NVDA , QCOM, Apple, and broadcom. I own all of those except Apple. I scooped up prior to last quarters earnings then sold. Im anxious to own them in the next few weeks when the bears are betting with conviction. But, there is still a lot of private capital in highertier AI offerings like OpenAI which I think is a little overrated, maybe strawberry will change that, Anthropic, Perplexity, and Cerebras. Theres a lot more money in private capital than there used to be, and really wealthy investors seem to be stepping into a void that was formerly occupied by big banks. Anyway, it should be an exciting week, and its still a long time before the Fed meets later this month, which might finally help the highdebt companies in the R2K more than it helps the Mag 7. Im still long on the stocks that have impressive quarter over quarter earnings growth. Though they will go in and out of style, good growth and a good PEG which fails to describe most of the Nasdaq puts upward pressure on PE multiples for those who can wait."

Many employees were hired as remote or mostly remote. Some of those employees have families and often dont even need to be in office. No perks in the world could make them return to the office.

The idea is to rent these stocks for their move higher before we enter a full blown recession which creates demand destruction. Now VALE like a lot of commodity mining stocks pays a variable dividend based on annual income. Their next semiannual dividend will likely be lower than 0.54. So while the 0.54 dividend I will get on Sept 11th is nice, its not why I am buying more shares. I also opened a position in NTR which is agriculture miner of Potash, Nitrogen, and Phosphate.

MBUU only has monthly options and not a ton of volume, and I want to use the earnings call to generate some premium and hopefully get assigned some more shares. So I sold the 32.50 put and the 30 put, both expiring 920. On the 32.50 Im getting 1.25 in premium, so I divide that into the capital required to make the trade 32.50, and I get 0.0385. Then I multiply that by 12 because this trade lasts one month and, in theory, I could do this trade or a similar trade on another company 12 times over the course of a year. That gets me 0.462, or an annualized return of 46. On the 30 put the annualized return is 28. If I get assigned Ill still have room for two more tranches after this in case MBUU continues further down. I also sold the call at 37.50 on half of the shares I own. My cost basis is 31.14 per share so Ill make money on both the premium and the sale if those get called away. I only did half because I want to own some shares if MBUU shoots up after earnings, but I also want to use the earnings call opportunity to reduce my cost basis per share as much as I can. Heres more detail on those trades. Ive found that using puts in tranches to enter companies I want to own long term that are trading at a price I want to own them at has been giving me a 20 return each of the last several years. Its a simple strategy without the risk of credit spreads, as long as its a company I actually want to own at the put price. Im interested in your thoughts."

Why cant they hatch the eggs and invest in their future harvest? Is that an implicit admission their return on egg is below their cost of capital?

The inverse correlation between 10year rolling CAPE and predicted future market returns has grown stronger, not weaker, over time due to more equitable market capitalization. The main reason why CAPE has been elevated since 2008 is abnormally low interest rates, which heavily skewed investor preference towards risk assets. When one compare yields across all fixedincome securities, including corporate bonds, to stock market returns over the last 15 years, the risk premium of stocks heavily outstrips the risk mitigation from including bonds in a portfolio. Anything below the 10year lost value versus inflation. first of alll we are more global vs the past. second of all, tech stocks are historically have higher PEs due to their ability to expand rapidly copying software is easy vs manufacturing new cars. These are cyclical factors, not secular. They also have no meaningful effect on PE, which is not tied to business performance or cost.

Disney stock is trading down about 3 today at 91. Its been as high as 124 and as low as 79 over the past year. Based on these, do you think 1. Disney is at deaths door like YouTube channels like Valliant Renegade is claiming and PeltzPerlmutter are only ones who can save it, and therefore, Iger must be ousted immediately and have those two take control of Disney? Why or why not? 2. They will try to oust Iger later this year? Why or why not? Also, if only they can save Disney, how do you think theyre going to save it? P.S. Personally, I dont want any of them to even get close to Disney or any other entertainment company ever again, but some of you guys seem to like those two, which is why I asked this question.

Additionally, the BOJ has said they see a soft landing ahead for the US, and a soft landing vs a recession was stated to be a prerequisite for them to raise rates again. So while Im not sure what the near term has in store for us, I remain wary of another ouchie scary time happening relatively soon. If I had to hazard a guess, probably around the time the US starts cutting rates. Though that probably means it will be anything but that time because my timing is always off."

I mean, the market share news is fantastic The Boca Raton, Floridabased company now has 11.5 control of the energy drink market, up from 8.7 a year ago, based on market share data from consumer data company Circana cited by Celsius Tuesday. Rivals Red Bull and Monster saw their share fall over the same period, with Monster down 1.6 percentage points and Red Bull 0.5, according to the Circana data. But 23 YoY growth is unimpressive. Maybe the comps are just tough. And if they are taking market share with this growth, it means the other beverage companies are also seeing a lull in sales growth. On the bright side, the forward PE has compressed dramatically. From 80s to like 30. I first started buying this stock around the low 50s, when it had a forward PE in the 70s90s. Were not too far away from that same share price with a 3rd of the PE, so they really did grow into the multiple. I first bought this stock expecting 40 revenue growth at a minimum to justify the multiple. That clearly is no longer the case but the multiple is also very fair now. So on this news, Im just sitting tight, not buying the dip or taking profits like I probably should have in the 90s."

Traders dodged the Feds interest rate hikes by leveraging up in another currency running at effectively zero and was depreciating against the USD. Now that it is unraveling and will continue to unravel over the next several months, Im wondering where the liquidity will come from to restore the tech market to its previous heights. If hedge funds continue to unwind in long tech, will this need to come from the retail sector? The Treasury and Fed are currently at loggerheads. The huge Tbill issuance Yellen has directed to finance deficit spending directly conflicts with Powells dual mandate as shortterm securities do not absorb liquidity long enough to choke off money velocity which is how inflation works through the economy. With an inverted yield curve, it actually creates a lot of interest for those with sufficient capital in MMFs. If were assuming historical patterns persist, we havent hit the parabolic curve the meltup period of the A.I. craze yet. Even with this recent pullback, some catalyst will spark the final leg that restores investor sentiment and leads the retail sector to allin on tech."

The international growth is only getting started. Also, Amazon sales were up a lot. Despite all the negativity that made it drop 50 from ATH, the growth story is very intriguing. Main reasons for the drop that Ive found analyst downgrades, Pepsi lowering inventory, and lowered consumer spending. The Pepsi inventory was the only main concern but as time goes on, I think Celsius will be able to expand distribution channels and be a lot less reliant on Pepsi overall. Lastly Ive seen some mentions about health concerns?? I really dont know much about energy drinks but I feel like that would be an overall concern and not specific to Celsius. Also I havent been able to find any proper articles documenting healthy concerns.. just a few comments on reddit."

But when it gets to the top band does he then sell the 2x leveraged sp500 and go to cash? Or does he sell it and buy a 2x leveraged bear shorting the sp500 until it hits the lower band again I personally think that second part would be nuts. Im all for buying at the bottom and riding it up. But I cannot imagine trying to find a sweet spot to short the sp500. Thats crazy"

Regarding keeping the traintest set separate although I wouldnt recommend deploying a lot of real money on it based on the results, a really interesting exploration that I think youre referring to trying too, or similar could be to optimize the parameters using data up through 2010 or so...and then see how the model performs from 20102024, especially around the financial crisis and COVID. And then you could do kind of the opposite, maybe training on 20042024 and then running it back to 1940. Theres all sorts of fun to be had! Regarding your last paragraph...its very difficult to expose yourself to worthwhile 2x leverage and also avoid significant drawdowns during market downturns unless youre assuming you can time exits and entries very well. I think if you could find a lowslippage means to get 1.52x leverage on a significant portion of your account, perhaps have a small amount of uncorrelated or negative beta assets in there too, and if past performance really were indicative of what well see in the future, Id guess from my armchair that you could maybe see 812 real returns on average over a very long period.

We have not talked about specific timeframes to testoptimize the parameters for. But yeah, can definitely be done and would be interesting. What I think would be interesting and I told him that he should investigate is the following. Try to generate your parameters with 10 years of historic training data throughout the data he has and see if the parameters changeshow a trend or converge towards a value. And in addition to that use all the data from 1940 to 1950, then from 1940 to 1960 and so on. Continuously increasing the training data and always evaluating for the next 10 years. And see if the resulting parameters converge towards a value or fluctuate. This would showproof somehow his method works not just for training data but also for test data and that the market is not changing so fast, that historical data is unuseable. He still has significant downturns and specifically looks and tries to avoid them. But he is aware that they are not unavoidable. That is why he is hesitant do enter right now, because the sp500 is at an ATH. so investing now would most likely result in a downturn. Or do you disagree? To be honest, I understand next to little of the last paragraph. But sounds like trying to reduce riskoverexposure to one asset give me some slack with the terminology here. I am not an expert.

Theyve been cutting costs, sold their HQ for 50m which hasnt shown on a Quarterly report yet. That will also reduce spend in the future. This will also be the first quarter in which the added revenue from the Overstock dot com relaunch will be included. Youre right, they definitely arent out of the woods yet. A lot of work to do. But from how it looks to me, not even the potential for a turnaround is priced in as of now. Their EPS is negative so PE is null, but the price to sales ratio is like 0.3 now. Market cap is not much higher than a single quarters revenue."

If youre really interested in the companyplay it wouldnt be a bad idea to listen throughwatch the investor conference they had along with this earnings. Im tentatively bullish on the company still. I think Lemonis has a lot of good ideas and has reformed after giving too many overly optimistic projections. He seems to be making much more conservative promises. I think having physical towel stores again is going to be a great thing for the company, letting people out in the world know that the brand still exists. Lemonis bought 1.5m in shares after the earnings reportthe stock tanking, which was by far his largest buyin to date. That unfortunately for me did absolutely nothing to move the stock up. I think the market is waiting for tangible results before theyre going to reprice. Shorts are probably still hoping for the bankruptcy. There was a lot of other bullish news before and after earnings, and again, none of that did anything to positively impact the price of the stock. That said, I think the stock is still highly undervalued even for the current situation. The company has a good balance sheet and other valuable assets. If you take the market cap and subtract their assets then the market is essentially valuing the company at 0. Lmk if you have any other questions though. Happy to chat despite the pain this has caused me. Edit I do also still have a very small position on. Calls for next June and Jan 2026. I think that will be enough time for them to sort their shit out for the online stores as well as have a decent number of physical stores spun up."
