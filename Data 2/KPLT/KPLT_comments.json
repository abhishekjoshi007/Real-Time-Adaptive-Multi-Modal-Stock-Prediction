They did so on two occasions that were so brazen and blatant that anyone watching on those days could tell that something really sneaky was up. It started with insider trading on Mar 13 (3pm-4pm) EST, the day before earnings were announced, then, followed by swapping shares between their own accounts on Sept 23 (3:45pm-4pm) EST, after the volume spiked over 100k shares in less than 15 minutes before the close. On both occasions they deliberately orchestrated an artificial sell off.Anyone can verify these crimes by checking Yahoo&#39;s Historic Data or similar ticker data service. You don&#39;t need a law firm to explain what happened. It was blatantly obvious.I&#39;m sure we will find more instances of illicit trading once the SEC and FBI match up the accounts from those two days.

Thank me later.Here&#39;s why:Lawsuit will be settled out of court due to the recent discovery investigations on the ex-Plaintiff and his cohort&#39;s insider trading (March 13 between 3pm-4pm EST) and share swapping between accounts (Sept 23 between 3:45pm-4pm EST). Both of these charge plus new ones to be unveiled soon come with fines and jail time for all involved, directly and indirectly.FlexShopper&#39;s patent infringement lawsuit will be dropped due to lacking merit. Under U.S. patent law (35 U.S.C. ¬ß 112(b)), a patent claim can be invalidated if it is indefinite, meaning it fails to clearly define the invention&#39;s scope with reasonable certainty (renting vs leasing). If the claims are so ambiguous that a person skilled in the art cannot determine what the patent is meant to cover, the patent may be considered indefinite and therefore invalid.KPLT&#39;s algorithm is 3x more effective than SEZL and 2+x more effective than FPAY&#39;s. KPLT&#39;s bad debt is at 9.3%, while SEZL&#39;s is at 30% and FPAY at 23%.KPLT is controlling cost and expects to hit BE by year&#39;s end. FYI: WayFair is expected to bounce back in 2025.

Instead, average down at their expense. Thank me later.Here&#39;s why:Lawsuit will be settled out of court due to the recent discovery investigations on the ex-Plaintiff and his cohort&#39;s insider trading (March 13 between 3pm-4pm EST) and share swapping between accounts (Sept 23 between 3:45pm-4pm EST). Both of these charge plus new ones that will be unveiled soon come with fines and jail time for all involved, directly and indirectly.FlexShopper&#39;s patent infringement lawsuit will be dropped due to lacking merit. Under U.S. patent law (35 U.S.C. ¬ß 112(b)), a patent claim can be invalidated if it is indefinite, meaning it fails to clearly define the invention&#39;s scope with reasonable certainty. If the claims are so ambiguous that a person skilled in the art cannot determine what the patent is meant to cover, the patent may be considered indefinite and therefore invalid.KPLT&#39;s algorithm is 3x more effective than SEZL and 2+x more effective than FPAY&#39;s. KPLT&#39;s bad debt is at 9.3%, while SEZL&#39;s is at 30% and FPAY at 23%.KPLT is controlling cost and expects to hit BE by year&#39;s end. FYI: WayFair is expected to bounce back in 2025.

That&#39;s what matters because it speaks directly to their competitive edge over their peers including SEZL which is at 30%.I would also expect them to declare the FPAY&#39;s patent infringement lawsuit as having no merit due to the ambiguity of terms used to describe renting vs leasing. The patent uses them interchangeably, when in fact they are different in both legal and financial terms. I would expect mgmt to work jointly with UPBD to void the patent due to ambiguity or &#39;indefiniteness&#39;.Here&#39;s what the USPT states about &#39;indefiniteness&#39;...The term used to void a patent due to ambiguity is &#34;indefiniteness&#34;. Under U.S. patent law (35 U.S.C. ¬ß 112(b)), a patent claim can be invalidated if it is indefinite, meaning it fails to clearly define the invention&#39;s scope with reasonable certainty. If the claims are so ambiguous that a person skilled in the art cannot determine what the patent is meant to cover, the patent may be considered indefinite and therefore invalid.Indefiniteness can arise from unclear language, vague terms, or inconsistent claim language."

If you fell for their pitch, take a closer look at two items.They boast a drop in bad debt from 33.4% to 22.5%.They plan to increase their marketing expenses by 71%.Essentially, for every $1 they lose to bad debt they need about $7 in new revenues, hence the 71% marketing expense increase is a total wash. ...and it&#39;s all because they don&#39;t use AI and ML like KPLT.FYI: KPLT&#39;s bad debt is 9.3% for Q2 showing an improvement from 9.7% in Q1. In short their algorithm is 2+x better than FPAY&#39;s.Instead FPAY moves delinquent accounts to collection agencies to hound their clients. The end result is just the opposite of what KPLT has achieved.KPLT&#39;s propensity to refer a friend is at 60%, while FPAY refuses to post their NPS score ...because it&#39;s so bad.The sign of a viable business is one that leverages their existing client base to refer new business."

The patent uses both terms interchangeably, when in fact they are different in both legal and financial terms. I would also expect KPLT to work jointly with UPBD to void the patent altogether. Here&#39;s what the USPT states about &#34;indefiniteness&#34;.The term used to void a patent due to ambiguity is &#34;indefiniteness&#34;. Under U.S. patent law (35 U.S.C. ¬ß 112(b)), a patent claim can be invalidated if it is indefinite, meaning it fails to clearly define the invention&#39;s scope with reasonable certainty. If the claims are so ambiguous that a person skilled in the art cannot determine what the patent is meant to cover, the patent may be considered indefinite and therefore invalid.Indefiniteness can arise from unclear language, vague terms, or inconsistent claim language."

Fortunately for smart money, no one is selling, only they are. ...and every time they sell, they become more and more exposed.With a tradable float of around 2m shares, it&#39;s obvious that they are holding a ton of synthetic shorts, way more than the legal limit. Oh, let&#39;s add that to our list of SEC trading violations.Insider trading - March 13 between 3pm-4pm ESTShare swapping between their own accounts - Sept 23 between 3:45pm-4pm ESTSynthetic shorts that aren&#39;t properly matched with unique long shares.... I&#39;m sure they are gaming it with rematching already matched shares and swapping them out again and again.Just ask yourself, why are shorts so desperate for shares? Matt has been posting non-stop as though he&#39;s been given an ultimatum. I guess they know like I have already posted that their only source of shares to cover their massive short positions is drying up fast. So, do yourself a BIG favor... Do like smart money is already doing,DO NOT SELL a single share. Let the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts cover their own shorts. In the meantime average down at their expense. Thank me later."

If they were smart, they&#39;d cover their shorts now, and let the pps surge to its fair value near SEZL&#39;s pps of $200.If they did, their remaining long position would gain far more value than what it is now.What they fail to understand is that KPLT&#39;s algorithm is 3x better than SEZL&#39;s and any other peer including FPAY. SEZL and FPAY have to make up the loss from their much larger bad debt numbers through increased revenues. KPLT does not. Plus, KPLT&#39;s algorithm depends upon a constant flow of training data to remain relevant, a job only they can do, SEZL and FPAY cannot.It&#39;s like having a hole in a boat. The larger the hole the harder the pump has to work to keep the boat afloat. At some point the leak&#39;s flow will exceed the pumps capacity. ...and guess what happens next?Of course, who am I kidding?The ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts know all this. That&#39;s why their plan all along has been to push KPLT to BK so they can pick up the algorithm for a song, then sell it to SEZL. Trouble is... KPLT continues to grow and a lot of us here are watching closely. So closely that we&#39;ve already caught the shorts in two trading infractions: insider trading on March 13 between 3-4pm EST and share swapping between accounts on Sept 23 between 3:45pm-4pm EST.Shorts see the value in KPLT and are willing to commit white collar crimes to steal it away from existing shareholders. Don&#39;t be fooled!DO NOT SELL a single share."

There are a dozen other ways to raise funds without affecting the OS. Check one of my previous posts for a list.If the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts can&#39;t rely on newly issued shares to cover their short positions, then they only have two other alternatives left:Shares from existing shareholders, which are few since insiders already hodl 46% of the float. They aren&#39;t selling.Settlement shares. But we already know that the lawsuit will very likely get tossed out by the judge on Dec 13, once the insider trading and share swapping charges against the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts are introduced into a renegotiation. In the event that the judge rules favorable, mgmt may choose to just pay the cash amount and forfeit the new share distribution.That leaves one alternative... buying back from existing shareholders.So, all that being said... Don&#39;t be fooled!Whatever you do, DO NOT SELL a single share. Let the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts cover their own shorts. In the meantime average down at their expense. Thank me later."

KPLT is a BK candidate if they can&#39;t be profitable in next two quarters as markets rip at all time highsand this is all time low&#39;s. KPLT is a LOSERThe market does not believe KPLT is a viable company. It hasn&#39;t in 3+ years.The only ones not selling KPLT are some insiders who can&#39;t currently and many long term bag holders who are down 60-95%. Like Tom, Mittens etc. The same people who said this would never R split at 20 and now it trades at 9 lol..Facts Tom. Stop deflecting with your wild fantasies .

Just pull down the trades for:March 13, 2024 between 3pm-4pm EST. You&#39;ll see that the shorts used a common signal of $19.99 to collude among each other. The following day we learn that the 10-K would be delayed by 45 days. Obviously they were privy to this intel, while the public was not....but if you&#39;re not convinced then try the next one.Sept 23, 2024 between 3:45pm-4pm EST the trading volume jumped from 6k to 155k or thereabouts. Clearly the ex-Plaintiff wanted to manipulate the pps below $10 to scare weak hands. He basically sold shares from his long hedge account and covered them with his massive short position in another account. 100% illegal.Where it all gets really interesting is that KPLT&#39;s negotiating team can now compare the account numbers and trader names who were active on both days. Oh, the coincidences will be enlightening, I&#39;m sure.Which brings me to my recent discovery from the Settlement mailed out to shareholders. The lawsuit is yet to be settled and could very well be thrown out by the judge on Dec 13. ...which I believe will happen once the KPLT negotiating team can show the ex-Plaintiff that his two charges include fines and jail time for ALL involved, directly and indirectly.BTW, I&#39;m sure once the FBI begins their investigations, they&#39;ll find many more instances. These were slip ups that were blatant."

KPLT is a BK candidate if they can&#39;t be profitable in next two quarters as markets rip at all time highsand this is all time low&#39;s. KPLT is a LOSERThe market does not believe KPLT is a viable company. It hasn&#39;t in 3+ years.The only ones not selling KPLT are some insiders who can&#39;t currently and many long term bag holders who are down 60-95%. Like Tom, Mittens etc. The same people who said this would never R split at 20 and now it trades at 9 lol..Facts Tom. Stop deflecting with your wild fantasies . You are the last big bull on here and we know you likely work for KPLT."

Every time their bad debt increases, they must make it up with more revenues, otherwise their &#39;ship&#39; sinks.It&#39;s similar to a trader. It&#39;s not the profits from a few trades that matter but the money they actually cash out and keep. ...another example is a ship with a leak. As long as the pump pulls more water than it takes in, the ship stays afloat. Once that reverses, however, it sinks. It&#39;s an unemotional fact of physics.KPLT&#39;s bad debt is at 9.3%. SEZL&#39;s and FPAY&#39;s is around 30%. KPLT&#39;s revenues may not be growing at the same pace but what is growing is staying to grow the business. That&#39;s what matters. ...and their achieving this level of bad debt using AI and ML....and for those of you who have no clue about ML. It&#39;s the training of data that matters and KPLT is training with the toughest clients, the unbanked, while their peers are doddling with credit scores that are a joke."

As long as the pump pulls more water than it takes in, the ship stays afloat. Once that reverses, however, it sinks. It&#39;s an unemotional fact of physics. KPLT&#39;s bad debt is at 9.3%. SEZL&#39;s and FPAY&#39;s is around 30%. KPLT&#39;s revenues may not be growing at the same pace but what is growing is staying to grow the business. That&#39;s what matters. ...and their achieving this level of bad debt using AI and ML....and for those of you who have no clue about ML.

KPLT is a BK candidate if they can&#39;t be profitable in next two quarters as markets rip at all time highsand this is all time low&#39;s. KPLT is a LOSERThe market does not believe KPLT is a viable company. It hasn&#39;t in 3+ years.The only ones not selling KPLT are some insiders who can&#39;t currently and many long term bag holders who are down 60-95%.

These 2 charges and more will easily neutralize the &#39;yet to be settled&#39; lawsuit set for Dec 13. I really doubt the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts can afford a thorough investigation of their activities (not just with KPLT). It would assuredly result in hefty fines and jail time for the entire crew including any indirect accomplices.The FPAY patent infringement lawsuit is a &#39;Hail Mary&#39; suit that will require FPAY to rewrite their patent to clarify all the many ambiguities in the current language, beginning with the interchanged terms of &#39;renting&#39; vs &#39;leasing&#39;. Any judge would throw this case out in a heart beat and accuse the company for trying to refer to their business activities in two different legal and financial terms with the hopes of encompassing the entire world of transactions that both terms represent individually.It&#39;s a joke! This lawsuit will end quickly after FPAY receives a few invoices from their legal team.FPAY is losing money hand over fist. Their last PR was fraught with unrealistic promises."

SEZLs credit score model is similar to a racing a car with one flat tire. Just imagine the additional fuel consumption (marketing dollars) needed to compensate for those losses due to the huge inefficiencies.In the AI and ML world what KPLT has achieved is significant. Few here realize it because they don&#39;t have the tech background. Instead they spew nonsense about BK. They have no clue.There&#39;s no BK here. Not with KPLT&#39;s algorithm improving daily with training from unbanked customers. Once SEZL figures out that they can&#39;t reduce their bad debt further due to their poor business model, they&#39;ll sniffing for a KPLT buyout. If not SEZL, it&#39;ll someone else. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind.Merging both credit score and unbanked will become the sought out perfect solution."

Why is there no one from the company addressing the free fall in the stock? it was at 1.90 60 days ago? This stock goes down more on a % basis then the rest of the market continuously. I am long 90k shares at a huge loss already.\n\n\nPosted 17 August, 2022\nhow come they have not landed bigger merchant accounts yet after all this time? been too long.. this looks like loser big time. we are all going down with the ship :( i am 80k share long at a huge loss already.. when is it enough? talk is cheap.. over it\n\nPosted 11 May, 2022\n100% agreed, the list of merchants for KPLT is very lower tier at best. Should have been some much b bigger names added by now. This merchant list is a joke. Where is the execution from KPLT? The time for excuse&#39;s has long passed."

I just did what my broker told me to do.&#34; ...and yet she was fined and jailed just for being part of the ring.Insider trading and especially swapping shares between two accounts to manipulate the pps are big NO-NO&#39;s with the SEC. There&#39;s a good reason for it. Anyone with deep pockets could manipulate the price of a company&#39;s shares and make them look bad.Fortunately, smart money knows what KPLT has and is doing. Most impressive, of course, is their algorithm. It filters out their bad debt with a 90.7% success rate. Their peers are closer to 70%. Visa card is around 95%. ...and we&#39;re talking about the toughest consumers to assess, the unbanked!Anyone who can&#39;t see and appreciate what they have achieved is either super dumb or holding out on a hidden agenda such as shorting the stock for their own gain."

I don&#39;t blame you.I guess it&#39;s true that when the ex-Plaintiff has been freely able to &#39;move the goal post&#39; with KPLT then making false claims is easy. What matters are the facts. KPLT is growing. The CFO is controlling costs. Their algorithm to reduce bad debt is improving and exceptional when compared to its peers. The latest lawsuit will be thrown out on Dec 13 when the judge sees how the ex-Plaintiff has been manipulating the pps to their benefit and trying to paint a false picture of the company, or simply settle early once the two parties renegotiate their positions.The ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts. are currently under investigation for insider trading (March 13 between 3pm-4pm EST and Sept 23 between 3:45pm-4pm EST). What happens next is that once the FBI gets involved, they will look at the trade logs and the firms involved. Once they know the names of the traders who traded on those days, they&#39;ll check their text messages and phone logs. I&#39;m pretty sure they will come up with more instances of wrongdoing than the two that I&#39;ve sited. Of course, they&#39;ll also check who they&#39;ve called/texted from their phone logs, then interview them to see if they are also part of the ring or can confirm illicit activities with other stocks.You obviously are aware and nervous. I would be too. You see... when you cheat and move the goal posts, it&#39;s no longer a fair game.¬†What follows are fines and jail time."

Deflecting from the true facts-KPLT is trading at all time low&#39;sKPLT is not profitable- for 3+ years nowKPLT REV growth numbers are very weakKPLT has a ton of debt on balance sheetNo insiders are buying KPLTNo big funds are buying KPLTKPLT has no coverage of any reputable Wall St firmsKPLT will miss earnings again - with lack of guidanceKPLT has incompetent leadership and board of directors.KPLT has failed to integrate it&#39;s APP effectively with big merchants.KPLT has two lawsuits to deal with that regardless of merit that will bleed the already fragile balance sheet.Conclusion? KPLT is a BK candidate if they can&#39;t be profitable in next two quarters as markets rip at all time highsand this is all time low&#39;s. KPLT is a LOSERThe market does not believe KPLT is a viable company. It hasn&#39;t in 3+ years.The only ones not selling KPLT are some insiders who can&#39;t currently and many long term bag holders who are down 60-95%. Like Tom, Mittens etc. The same people who said this would never R split at 20 and now it trades at 9 lol..Facts Tom. Stop deflecting with your wild fantasies . You are the last big bull on here and we know you likely work for KPLT."

Big difference!Rob was inquiring earlier about the issue of mgmt not buying more shares recently.Insiders already own 46% of the float. Why buy more unless to take the firm private. However, the main reason why they aren&#39;t buying now is due to their likely legal council&#39;s advice to avoid hyping until the case is tossed out by the NY Judge on Dec 13. It just makes legal sense to refrain, otherwise, the plaintiff could use the action against them, especially since the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts have been and continue to manipulate the pps at will.That&#39;s why the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts have been unafraid and outright brazen to violate SEC laws . Just check out what they&#39;ve done...insider trading that occurred on March 13 between 3pm-4pm ESTstock swapping between accounts to manipulate the pps down that occurred on Sept 23 between 3:45pm-4pm EST.They must think its funny.However, earlier today I watched a special on Raj Rajaratnam&#39;s huge insider trading case during 2009. He was arrested on Oct 16, 2009 after an extensive investigation. His entire ring of traders and informants were thrown into the can. The FBI&#39;s message was clear to Wall Street.&#34;Don&#39;t think that you&#39;re above the law because we will come after you.&#34;"

What we do know however, is that mgmt is not asleep at the wheel. They know what is going on and taking action.Keep in mind that their AI and ML solution is far superior than SEZL&#39;s, KLARNA&#39;s, or even FPAY. The metric to follow is their percentage of bad debt. KPLT&#39;s is at 9.3%, while the others are hovering around 30%. The others rely on credit scores, while KPLT&#39;s does not.Think about it! Whose the smarter of the bunch? KPLT by a long shot! When the market sees the AI value here, the pps will react even more.

It offered to me a glimpse behind the scenes about mgmt.

It demonstrates that the charges are on weak foundations, however, the Plaintiff&#39;s legal team has leveraged New York State laws that tend to favor shareholders.Then on page 9, point number 27: &#34;What might happen if there were no settlement?&#34;&#34;If there were no Settlement and Plaintiffs failed to establish any essential legal or factual element of the alleged claims, neither Plaintiffs nor the Settlement Class would recover anything from Defendants.&#34;Finally, on page 20, point# 67:&#34;The Settlement Hearing will be held on December 13, 2024... ...The court reserves the right to approve the Settlement..."

These charges come with fines and jail time. ...just ask Martha Stuart. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see the ex-Plaintiff pull out prior to the arbitrator&#39;s decision to avoid facing potential charges from the SEC.The latest patent infringement from FlexShopper is a joke. FPAY&#39;s patent will be challenged on numerous counts one of which even Chat GPT found to show serious ambiguities. When asked, here&#39;s what Chat GPT said:&#34;Yes, there is an inconsistency in using the terms &#34;rent&#34; and &#34;leasing&#34; interchangeably, as they have different meanings and implications, particularly in legal and financial contexts.&#34;FPAY is also a predatory lender. KPLT is not. That&#39;s why KPLT has an NPS score &gt;60, when FPAY is probably closer to zero. FYI: An NPS score measures the propensity to refer a friend.Finally, smart money is not selling. Here&#39;s whyKPLT is currently training an algorithm that successfully filters out the unbanked. What that essentially means is that they are doing better than SEZL and their peers at reducing bad debt. KPLT&#39;s peers use all the standard credit scoring systems, which are proving to be inferior to KPLT&#39;s solution.It&#39;s all there if you take a moment to educate yourself on the power of AI and ML."

They don&#39;t use any AI or ML to filter out their bad clients. Instead they rely on a cadre of money chasers who are trained to hound hard working clients and pound them into submission by charging penalties and higher rates.You can&#39;t build a business on hate. It&#39;s just not sustainable. FPAY will fail.KPLT uses AI and ML. They approve 60% of their waterfall clients, hence filtering out the undesirables from the outstart. They help their clients get through tough times, which converts into a super high NPS score &gt;60, unheard of.So you see, smart people follow smart companies. Maybe you should do the same. If you aren&#39;t capable, then simply short FPAY. Thank me later."

Tom has been wrong 100% of the time for two years now. He likely works for KPLT. Just to get even most need a 4-600% rise on the share price, or even more. Not happening..43 cents is current pre split price. it split at 85 cents ( 20) The pre split price is relevant because that&#39;s what the majority of what you all paid. Some paid 30-60 per share ( pre split!)40 dollars per share would only be= 1.70 per share pre split price. All of you bought way before split so this is the reality of how bleak it really is..Tom said among other things now going back before split-Split would crush the shorts with higher priceSplit would attract a lot of new institutional buyersSplit would attract a lot of new retail buyersSplit would attract more analyst overage from reputable firms on Wall STKPLT price would rise sharplyKPLT is 43 cents now and down over 50% since split and facing a new law suit that will required cash on balance sheet to be used to defend. And they STILL are not profitable and won&#39;t be this quarter either."

Their Q2 earnings report sites two major issues:Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Improved to 22.5% of gross lease billings and fees in Q2 2024 from 33.4% in Q2 2023.The company is still in the process of finding a new bank partner to reintroduce high APR loans, following the exit of their previous partner.Let&#39;s compare them with KPLT... It&#39;ll help you appreciate how incredibly undervalued KPLT is today.KPLT&#39;s bad debt went from 9.7% to 9.3%. Compared to FPAY&#39;s outrageous 33.4% to 22.5%! The difference between them is that KPLT uses AI and ML to filter out their undesirable accounts, while FPAY does not. FPAY lets in anyone with a credit score above 500. Even a 22.5% bad debt is nuts! Essentially, a quarter of their loans default....which explains why point number two is so important.The only way FPAY can stay in business is by ripping off their customers. They overcharge for a product or loan out at loan shark rates. Unlike KPLT that is proud to publish their NPS score of &gt;60, FPAY can&#39;t and won&#39;t. The previous bank partner probably left to avoid the bad rap from FPAY&#39;s biz model of ripping off honest customers....which also explains why they are pouring more money into marketing (70% increase). FPAY can&#39;t rely on repeat business. Just take a look at their reviews from sitejabber.&#34;FlexShopper has a rating of 2.7 stars from 754 reviews, indicating that most customers are generally dissatisfied with their purchase&#34;"

I couldn&#39;t even make this stuff up, if I tried!That&#39;s hilarious! I bet they must have choked when they received their first invoice from their &#39;pow-pow&#39; law firm whose lowest rate is over $2k per hour.We know that they are hemorrhaging cash fast. Their business model of loaning out up to $5k for any purchases without using a targeted and properly trained algorithm like KPLT is extremely flawed.Their hopes now hinge on surviving their attorney&#39;s monthly invoices. Unfortunately for them their business patent will be near impossible to defend, not just because business patents are easy to circumvent but more so because the patent awarded to them is packed with ambiguities.The law firm will have to defend the patent from being revoked, which will most likely require a rewrite and reapproval process that could take years. When all is said and done, the final draft will no longer apply to KPLT.If the flawed business model doesn&#39;t put them out of business, the attorney&#39;s invoices will."

Direct Public Offering (DPO)¬† ¬†- How it works: In a DPO, the company sells shares directly to the public, avoiding underwriters or intermediaries that might otherwise sell shares to institutional investors who could cover short positions.### 2. Private Placement¬† ¬†- How it works: The company sells shares privately to a selected group of institutional or accredited investors rather than offering them on the open market.### 3. Strategic Partnership or Investor¬† ¬†- How it works: The company sells a block of shares to a strategic partner, such as another company or a large institutional investor, as part of a long-term alliance.### 4. Convertible Debt Issuance¬† ¬†- How it works: Instead of issuing equity directly, the company issues convertible debt, which gives bondholders the option to convert the debt into shares at a later date.### 5. Long-Term Lock-up Period for New Shares¬† ¬†- How it works: If the company sells shares through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or a secondary offering, they can impose a lock-up period where the new shares cannot be sold for a fixed duration (typically 6 months).### 6. Dual-Class Shares¬† ¬†- How it works: A company may issue shares with different classes (e.g., Class A and Class B) where one class has limited or no voting rights but is preferred for dividends, while the other class has voting rights but no dividend preference."

Here&#39;s what it came back with.Yes, there is an inconsistency in using the terms &#34;rent&#34; and &#34;leasing&#34; interchangeably, as they have different meanings and implications, particularly in legal and financial contexts. Here&#39;s why:1. Duration:¬† ¬†- Rent: Refers to short-term use of an asset. Rental agreements are typically flexible and renewed periodically, often month-to-month or for even shorter periods (days or weeks).¬† ¬†- Lease: Refers to long-term use of an asset, with a fixed duration specified in a contract (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, or longer). A lease typically requires a greater commitment.2. Commitment and Flexibility:¬† ¬†- Rent: Offers more flexibility, allowing the renter to return the item without long-term commitment. Rental terms can often be canceled or altered easily.¬† ¬†- Lease: Involves a longer commitment, and early termination of a lease usually comes with penalties. It&#39;s less flexible compared to renting.3. Legal Implications:¬† ¬†- Rent: Rental agreements are typically more informal and can be adjusted with less notice.¬† ¬†- Lease: Leases are legally binding contracts with specific terms regarding how long the lessee can use the asset and what happens if either party breaks the agreement.(continues on next post)"

His landlord must be on his case for overdue rent and the ex-Plaintiff isn&#39;t willing to give him another advance for his ineffective posts. Here&#39;s why...The SEC has obviously opened an investigation for the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts insider trading on March 13 between 3-4pm and for the share swapping from multiple accounts to manipulate the pps on Sept 23 between 3:45-4pm. Anyone can verify these crimes using Yahoo&#39;s &#39;Historical Data&#39;. Of course, the SEC has access to names and account numbers. I&#39;m sure they will see the same person(s) involved in both dates.There&#39;s also a potential of another insider trading case based on Sept 23&#39;rds pps manipulation. It&#39;s quite possible that the ex-Plaintiff knew about the Flex patent infringement case prior to it becoming public information and deliberately pulled the pps down.Individually these egregious crimes aren&#39;t as effective as they would be as an aggregate, hence once the SEC can connect the names and account numbers, the convictions should emerge.The irony of course is that an ex-Plaintiff who is gaming the system in a most brazen manner for his own personal benefit is hitting on a company whose mission is to help the unbanked, many of whom are hard working individuals. It&#39;s pathetic and I&#39;m quite certain that poetic justice will prevail.In the meantime every shareholder can do their part. There&#39;s no need to wait on the SEC. Simply DO NOT SELL a single share. Let the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts.."

He&#39;s even broken SEC laws twice with insider trading on March 13 (3-4pm) plus trade swapping between accounts to manipulate the pps on Sept 23 between (3:45pm-4pm). Anyone can check it on the web. As of late he&#39;s even thrown in the kitchen sink with Flex&#39;s bogus business patent that&#39;s riddled with ambiguities. The timing of all of his shenanigans reveals the truth. He&#39;s very desperate!I can only imagine just how serious his short position must actually be for him to risk fines and jail time for his actions. ...just ask Martha Stuart.Of course, if no one sells shares to him, then he will have to cover his massive position on his own including his synthetic shorts. That would not only be poetic justice for those of us that have had to put up with all of his illicit actions, but revert to a nice ride to a fair value of $200 or higher.In the meantime mgmt is doing what they said they would do... increase revs, add partners, control costs, and further train their learning algorithm to minimize bad debt.The macro tail winds should also help out, including increased US retail spending, lower interest rates from the Feds, and an expected strong Q3 and Q4. Oh, ...and did I mention BE by year end? Smart money knows all this...Whatever you do, DO NOT SELL a single share. Let the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts cover their own shorts."

Their stock has been trading under a buck for over a month, which eventually could trigger a delisting warning letter form the SEC. Their MarketCap is less than half of KPLTs.I checked their App and Reviews. No AI or machine learning algorithm mentioned. They charge 15%+ in interest for unpaid balances. One Redit review mentioned that they deliberately modify the price of goods on the screen. In his specific case, an item that was going for around $900 direct with the merchant was showing $2,700, if purchased with FlexPay. That&#39;s 3x more! ...and no where did they spell out a reason for the increase. It was done in a stealth manner.They promise up to $5k in credit to buy whatever you want on any site, while KPLT gives up to $3,500 for a good that you choose to purchase at the time you choose to purchase it. That&#39;s a huge difference in risk exposure. Flex is loaning out money to buy stuff, while KPLT is loaning money to buy a specific item, hence controlling risk on a lease by lease basis. Big difference!I&#39;m glad I had a chance to compare these two companies. It has made me feel even better about KPLT&#39;s prospects. FlexPay&#39;s model is definitely doomed. If they think they will recover from a patent infringement gig, wait until they get the attorney&#39;s first bill. Yeowser!"

Duration:¬† ¬†- Renting: Generally for a short-term period (e.g., days, weeks, or months).¬† ¬†- Leasing: Typically for a longer-term period (e.g., 6 months to several years).2. Ownership:¬† ¬†- Renting: You do not have the option to own the item at the end of the rental period.¬† ¬†- Leasing: Some leases may include the option to purchase the item at the end of the lease term.3. Flexibility:¬† ¬†- Renting: More flexible in terms of return, allowing you to return the item on short notice.¬† ¬†- Leasing: Less flexible; breaking a lease early can result in penalties.4. Cost:¬† ¬†- Renting: Typically higher cost per month, but since the period is shorter, overall expenses may be lower.¬† ¬†- Leasing: Lower monthly payments spread over a longer period, potentially costing more in total.5. Maintenance:¬† ¬†- Renting: The rental company is usually responsible for maintenance and repairs.¬† ¬†- Leasing: Maintenance responsibilities can vary, but the lessee may be responsible for minor repairs or upkeep....continues in the post above"

From what I read, KPLT won&#39;t have any issue showing that the suit has no merit. In fact there&#39;s glaring grounds for voiding these patents altogether.I&#39;ll share the most glaring error.Just enter any of the Patent Numbers from the article into Google and click the first option from the search.In their patent Flex states the following:&#34;An RTO transaction is typically a type of legally documented transaction under which goods are leased or rented in exchange for a regularly scheduled payment with the option to purchase at some point during the agreement.&#34;This statement is incorrect and misleading because renting is not the same as leasing. They are two distinct financial options with different benefits, reporting requirements, and tax consequences. Assuming they can be rolled into an RTO is erroneous because anytime they make reference to one (renting or leasing), they have to make reference to the other in its proper context, and they failed to do that. In other words, a &#39;lease payment&#39; is not the same as a &#39;rental payment&#39;. Accounting 101... All 5 patents are riddled with this discrepancy in at least 40 instances each.Next I asked ChatGPT to list 10 differences between renting and leasing, just to hone in on this glaring error. I&#39;ll post the answers in the post above..."

He was willing to violate SEC trading laws (i.e. insider trading on March 13 and share swapping on Sept 23) to achieve his goal. He&#39;s probably received a legal notice from the SEC letting him know that he is now under investigation. He probably has also learned from peers that a safer way to &#39;manipulate&#39; share price is to drum up more bogus lawsuit PR&#39;s like the one from yesterday.  Even if the accusation is far reaching and absurd, the optics can be used to scare shareholders. ...just look at Pomerantz.What it confirms to those that have business experience is that the ex-Plaintiff is desperate for shares. ...not only desperate, but looking at some potential fines and jail time, ...just ask Martha Stuart.So, whatever you do, DO NOT SELL a single share.

It was a cheap legal shot with the hopes of drumming up baseless fear.Clearly the ex-Plaintiff needs as many shares as he can get to cover his short positions and has been willing to do anything including violating SEC laws. Now that the evidence is out that he committed insider trading and share swapping, he&#39;s throwing anything and everything up against the wall to see if something will divert attention. Guess what, it won&#39;t.There are companies out there that buy up patents then sue large companies with the hopes of getting some quick settlement money. ...and when they realize that their case has no merit, guess what they do, ...they evaporate.Based on the zero response today, considering the PR came out at 8am, this one will go the way Pomerantz solicitations went last April. No where. You can still see them listed on the right side of the screen with Stocktwits. It should serve as a good reminder to everyone of how sleazy the legal business has become.

I&#39;m sure the team will be happy to add all of your posts to the list for their future investigations....and no, you&#39;re wrong!No one is going to bury KPLT and nothing is over. The lawsuit amounts have been settled. Once paid, mgmt will be able to speak freely again. I&#39;m sure they will have a lot to say.In the meantime the ex-Plaintiff is doing everything he can to game the system on the share conversion component of the settlement. He needs these shares to cover his oversized short positions. My guess is that mgmt will choose to settle in all cash to force the ex-Plaintiff and his cohorts to cover on their own dime.If mgmt does..., the surge in the pps that will follow will be epic. If you need a reference point, checkout SEZL. Same OS. Same Revs. Higher bad debt rate compared to KPLT. Less effective algo than KPLT&#39;s. The difference is simply share price manipulation by the ex-Plaintiff. Once removed, the sky is the limit!Plain and simple..."

Two different lawsuits unrelated now to fend off at same time , still not profitable and burning cash. Are you sure Tom you are not short :) Put your orders in now to sell ASAP - We have been warning you for 2.5+ years or longer. What is KPLT going to release on this? If  it has no merit let&#39;s see them countersue ASAPNot.. Zero=KPLT is a CL OWN Show.. Fraud under the hood everywhere."

Clearly he has no idea of the value of KPLT&#39;s algorithm, that&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t know the first thing about machine learning. The only reason the pps is down is due to the ex-Plaintiff&#39;s illicit efforts to manipulate the pps. There&#39;s no other reason.I can pinpoint two instances that anyone can check using Yahoo&#39;s Historical Data.First was on March 13 when he did insider trading just before the close. The ex-Plaintiff was privy of intel that the rest of us were not. They used a $19.99 ceiling price to signal to their cohorts. The second was on Sept 23 when he swapped shares from one account to another to simulate volume. Both are big no-no&#39;s with the SEC. A simple comparison of account numbers that traded between 3 and 4pm on both days will prove my point. Rest assure, it will all come out at the end. Whatever you do, DO NOT SELL a single share. Let the shorts cover their own positions and then some. KPLT is not going BK. They are growing and doing just fine."

Both instances occurred between 3-4pm of their respective trading day.First was on March 13, the day before earnings were released. The trading pattern during the last hour of trading demonstrated potential insider trading. Someone within their ranks learned prior to it being released publicly that their 10K would be delayed for another 45 days or so. Pomerantz, the ambulance chaser was all over it with solicitations the following day. The pps dropped from $20 down to its current levels.The second instance was on Monday, Sept 23, again between 3-4pm. There we all witnessed the trading volume jumping from 2k to 150k in the last 5 minutes of trading. The only way that could happen was if the ex-Plaintiff was swapping shares between his two accounts. He basically sold shares from one account and covered in another, while depressing the pps below the psychological $10 level.Here&#39;s the interesting part... Both insider trading and stock swapping between accounts to manipulate the pps are frowned upon by the SEC. Fines and jail time usually follow once convicted. Just ask Martha Stuart...KPLT&#39;s mgmt advisors could easily check the names and account numbers for both days. I&#39;d wager that when they do, they will come up with some interesting coincidences worth further investigating."

Busted!!Ex-Plaintiff must have had his algo on alert at the close. It&#39;s doing everything it can to hold below the EMA 20. Volume going from 6k to 44k near the close was a dead giveaway. I&#39;d guess a good chunk was just more shorting. HIs efforts to manipulate the pps are becoming strikingly obvious. That&#39;s a big no no with the SEC.

After understanding better what they do, perhaps you and others can appreciate just how extensively oversold the pps is today (trading at a level where it&#39;s cash balance now is equal to its Market Cap).It should also help you realize how the ex-Plaintiff is trying hard to game the system by lowering the pps artificially to collect more shares from the legal settlement. They have an extensive short position to cover and plan to use the settlement shares.Yea, manipulating the pps is frowned upon by the SEC, but whose watching? Right?Despite all the illicit gaming, shareholders do have a simple recourse of NOT SELLING a single share and instead letting the ex-Plaintiff short more shares and averaging down as they do. Eventually, a hedge fund will get wind of this anomaly and scoop up shares. ...not just because they see an opportunity from an over extended ex-Plaintiff but really because what KPLT has in-house with their 5+ years of valuable training data.VC&#39;s have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars to develop training data for Gen AI startups. You don&#39;t think that having a solid and proven training database on filtering out the toughest credit situations isn&#39;t worth a lot of money to someone like SEZL, Klarna, PayPal, and others, especially at these absurdly discounted prices? ...and with $38m in cash! It&#39;s an LBO&#39;s dream come true!Think again!"

In laymen terms, KPLT uses standard machine learning algorithms designed for financial companies who use them to determine if a loan should be granted or not and the maximum amount, etc. They are the same ones that AWS and AZURE offer and that KPLT&#39;s peers use today.The difference between KPLT&#39;s and say SEZL&#39;s machine learning algorithms are the weights or parameters assigned to each feature. Features are essentially attributes such as Experian score, gender, age, income, etc. Most of these ML algorithms have over 100 features. Each feature is weighted by some factor based on the training data used to train the algorithm.Since KPLT deals with non-prime clients many of whom may be unbanked, their training data will look significantly different from SEZL&#39;s and hence the weights assigned to each feature. In addition KPLT most likely has developed their own set of features over the years that have proven to generate more reliable outcomes.Most noteworthy, KPLT was able to drop their &#39;bad debt&#39; from 9.7% to 9.3%. That shift shows that the features used and the weights assigned are working in their favor. In other words, their ML algorithm is successfully filtering through the toughest prospects.What makes KPLT so valuable is that they have been collecting data on non-prime customers for nearly 5 years!!"

Or maybe Affirm will have a strong 2H of 2024 and just acquire Sezzle and/or Katapult, why not?? Better than boiler rooms and explaintiffs fantasy land stories, right??"

Net loss improved year-over-year. What is higher turnover? We have not increased our debt vehicle, so I don&#39;t understand that conclusion either. As we disclosed, we delivered ~9% revenue growth and improved Adj. EBITDA. We also believe we will deliver positive Adj. EBITDA for the full year 2024, which will be the first time we have done this since 2021.\n\nWe also disclosed in our call that we are also on a path to deliver higher income from operations as early as 2025. We are also striving to be cash usage neutral in 2025, which we have said we expect to be an inflection year for us. During our call we stated that we believe we can turn the corner into cash accretion after 2025.\n\nI hope this detail helps.\n\nJennifer"

Here&#39;s what they said:Write-offs as a percentage of revenue were 9.3% in the second quarter of 2024 and are within the Company‚Äôs 8% to 10% long-term target range. This is a 30 bps improvement compared with 9.6% in the second quarter of 2023.The reason it is so significant is that the reduction proves that their algorithm is not only working but also improving over time. What is more noteworthy... they accomplished this improvement and low number from the least desirable client base. That would be similar to comparing a sales person who is given a stack of long time rejects and yet manages to convert them into real business revenue.Compare the above statement from SEZL&#39;s Earnings Report:Transaction Related Costs1 as a percentage of UMS increased YoY from 4.2% to 4.5%. The increase was attributable to a rise in the percentage of Provision for Credit Losses, offset by decreases in the relative percentages for both Transaction Expense and Net Interest Expense.Clearly one is able to decrease their write offs while the other cannot. Eventually, the winner will be KPLT&#39;s algo."

If they were they too would see their incredible progress.The key number in the entire call was their 9.3% provision for non-performing loans, a drop from last quarter&#39;s 9.7%. That trend screams out that their algorithm is working and getting better. If you recall one of their disclaimers was the ability of their algo to sniff out the bad apples. Not only is it doing a fantastic job but it&#39;s doing it with all the rejects from their competitors. In the ML world that is nothing less than awesome!!!I can see that so many of you here aren&#39;t up to snuff with ML and algos.

Yes I was not impressed with the results even though they had growth in many areas it wasn&#39;t substantial enough and wasn&#39;t conveyed well at all to investors, nor was the future ambitions towards success. This was because of the talks of marco environment headwinds taking away from their platform expansion improvements which they had in the earnings call .
