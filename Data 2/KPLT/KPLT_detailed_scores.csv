It&#39;ll help you appreciate how incredibly undervalued KPLT is today.KPLT&#39;s bad debt went from 9.7% to 9.3%. Compared to FPAY&#39;s outrageous 33.4% to 22.5%! The difference between them is that KPLT uses AI and ML to filter out their undesirable accounts, while FPAY does not. FPAY lets in anyone with a credit score above 500. Even a 22.5% bad debt is nuts! Essentially, a quarter of their loans default....which explains why point number two is so important.The only way FPAY can stay in business is by ripping off their customers. They overcharge for a product or loan out at loan shark rates. Unlike KPLT that is proud to publish their NPS score of &gt;60, FPAY can&#39;t and won&#39;t. The previous bank partner probably left to avoid the bad rap from FPAY&#39;s biz model of ripping off honest customers....which also explains why they are pouring more money into marketing (70% increase).

Private Placement¬† ¬†- How it works: The company sells shares privately to a selected group of institutional or accredited investors rather than offering them on the open market.### 3. Strategic Partnership or Investor¬† ¬†- How it works: The company sells a block of shares to a strategic partner, such as another company or a large institutional investor, as part of a long-term alliance.### 4. Convertible Debt Issuance¬† ¬†- How it works: Instead of issuing equity directly, the company issues convertible debt, which gives bondholders the option to convert the debt into shares at a later date.### 5. Long-Term Lock-up Period for New Shares¬† ¬†- How it works: If the company sells shares through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or a secondary offering, they can impose a lock-up period where the new shares cannot be sold for a fixed duration (typically 6 months).### 6. Dual-Class Shares¬† ¬†- How it works: A company may issue shares with different classes (e.g., Class A and Class B) where one class has limited or no voting rights but is preferred for dividends, while the other class has voting rights but no dividend preference.",Neutral,0,0.9999669790267944,Main

Here&#39;s why:1. Duration:¬† ¬†- Rent: Refers to short-term use of an asset. Rental agreements are typically flexible and renewed periodically, often month-to-month or for even shorter periods (days or weeks).¬† ¬†- Lease: Refers to long-term use of an asset, with a fixed duration specified in a contract (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, or longer). A lease typically requires a greater commitment.2. Commitment and Flexibility:¬† ¬†- Rent: Offers more flexibility, allowing the renter to return the item without long-term commitment. Rental terms can often be canceled or altered easily.¬† ¬†- Lease: Involves a longer commitment, and early termination of a lease usually comes with penalties. It&#39;s less flexible compared to renting.3. Legal Implications:¬† ¬†- Rent: Rental agreements are typically more informal and can be adjusted with less notice.¬† ¬†- Lease: Leases are legally binding contracts with specific terms regarding how long the lessee can use the asset and what happens if either party breaks the agreement.(continues on next post)",Neutral,0,0.999971866607666,Main

Yahoo,2024-10-03,"Matt, don&#39;t get your hopes up. I checked all 5 patents descriptions and found numerous errors, inconsistencies, and easy loop holes in each. From what I read, KPLT won&#39;t have any issue showing that the suit has no merit. In fact there&#39;s glaring grounds for voiding these patents altogether.I&#39;ll share the most glaring error.Just enter any of the Patent Numbers from the article into Google and click the first option from the search.In their patent Flex states the following:&#34;An RTO transaction is typically a type of legally documented transaction under which goods are leased or rented in exchange for a regularly scheduled payment with the option to purchase at some point during the agreement.&#34;This statement is incorrect and misleading because renting is not the same as leasing. They are two distinct financial options with different benefits, reporting requirements, and tax consequences. Assuming they can be rolled into an RTO is erroneous because anytime they make reference to one (renting or leasing), they have to make reference to the other in its proper context, and they failed to do that. In other words, a &#39;lease payment&#39; is not the same as a &#39;rental payment&#39;. Accounting 101... All 5 patents are riddled with this discrepancy in at least 40 instances each.Next I asked ChatGPT to list 10 differences between renting and leasing, just to hone in on this glaring error.

We already know that the ex-Plaintiff is trying to manipulate the pps down for his benefit. He was willing to violate SEC trading laws (i.e. insider trading on March 13 and share swapping on Sept 23) to achieve his goal. He&#39;s probably received a legal notice from the SEC letting him know that he is now under investigation. He probably has also learned from peers that a safer way to &#39;manipulate&#39; share price is to drum up more bogus lawsuit PR&#39;s like the one from yesterday.  Even if the accusation is far reaching and absurd, the optics can be used to scare shareholders. ...just look at Pomerantz.What it confirms to those that have business experience is that the ex-Plaintiff is desperate for shares. ...not only desperate, but looking at some potential fines and jail time, ...just ask Martha Stuart.So, whatever you do, DO NOT SELL a single share.

Both instances occurred between 3-4pm of their respective trading day.First was on March 13, the day before earnings were released.

Someone within their ranks learned prior to it being released publicly that their 10K would be delayed for another 45 days or so. Pomerantz, the ambulance chaser was all over it with solicitations the following day.

They have an extensive short position to cover and plan to use the settlement shares.Yea, manipulating the pps is frowned upon by the SEC, but whose watching?

Yahoo,2024-09-10,"Since mgmt is obviously unable to speak for themselves due to the pending legal settlement, let me share with all of you the reason why KPLT is incredibly undervalued. In laymen terms, KPLT uses standard machine learning algorithms designed for financial companies who use them to determine if a loan should be granted or not and the maximum amount, etc. They are the same ones that AWS and AZURE offer and that KPLT&#39;s peers use today.The difference between KPLT&#39;s and say SEZL&#39;s machine learning algorithms are the weights or parameters assigned to each feature. Features are essentially attributes such as Experian score, gender, age, income, etc. Most of these ML algorithms have over 100 features. Each feature is weighted by some factor based on the training data used to train the algorithm.Since KPLT deals with non-prime clients many of whom may be unbanked, their training data will look significantly different from SEZL&#39;s and hence the weights assigned to each feature. In addition KPLT most likely has developed their own set of features over the years that have proven to generate more reliable outcomes.Most noteworthy, KPLT was able to drop their &#39;bad debt&#39; from 9.7% to 9.3%. That shift shows that the features used and the weights assigned are working in their favor. In other words, their ML algorithm is successfully filtering through the toughest prospects.What makes KPLT so valuable is that they have been collecting data on non-prime customers for nearly 5 years!!",Neutral,0,0.9998855590820312,Main

Hello,

It&#39;s hard to understand what you are asking. Net loss improved year-over-year. What is higher turnover? We have not increased our debt vehicle, so I don&#39;t understand that conclusion either. As we disclosed, we delivered ~9% revenue growth and improved Adj. EBITDA. We also believe we will deliver positive Adj. EBITDA for the full year 2024, which will be the first time we have done this since 2021.

We also disclosed in our call that we are also on a path to deliver higher income from operations as early as 2025. We are also striving to be cash usage neutral in 2025, which we have said we expect to be an inflection year for us. During our call we stated that we believe we can turn the corner into cash accretion after 2025.

I hope this detail helps.

This is a 30 bps improvement compared with 9.6% in the second quarter of 2023.The reason it is so significant is that the reduction proves that their algorithm is not only working but also improving over time. What is more noteworthy... they accomplished this improvement and low number from the least desirable client base. That would be similar to comparing a sales person who is given a stack of long time rejects and yet manages to convert them into real business revenue.Compare the above statement from SEZL&#39;s Earnings Report:Transaction Related Costs1 as a percentage of UMS increased YoY from 4.2% to 4.5%.

&#34;Customers remain cautious in their spending on the home,&#34; according to Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah.

The furniture retailer&#39;s third-quarter guidance, to a decline in the low single digits, was lower than analysts expected.

Second-quarter revenue fell 1.7% year-over-year.

People aren‚Äôt buying furniture to a degree that hasn‚Äôt been felt since the Great Recession of 2008, according to Wayfair&#39;s (W) CEO.
