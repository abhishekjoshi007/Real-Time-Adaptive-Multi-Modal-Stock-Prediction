Reddit,2024-10-19,The actual quality of coffee at Starbucks has never been Stier but in the last few years there is no denying its fallen even further down the crapper. Ever since the failed Roasters or blacklabel push where most of those fancy press dripsim machines were constantly breaking it never came back. The regular blends are just not good. 95 of the time you are getting a Pike that tastes like burnt Folgers. Schultz is right in every assessment hes put out recently. Starbucks has lost its way.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"Good question. Heres what it says If the Russian economy collapses, it could strain Russias ability to continue the war in Ukraine, potentially hastening an end to the conflict. The subsequent rebuilding of Ukraine would offer significant opportunities for American businesses across various sectors. Companies Likely to Benefit Construction and Engineering Firms Companies like Caterpillar Inc. CAT and Deere Company DE could see increased demand for construction machinery and equipment. Fluor Corporation FLR and Jacobs Solutions Inc. J might secure contracts for largescale engineering and infrastructure projects. Infrastructure and Materials Suppliers Nucor Corporation NUE and Vulcan Materials Company VMC could benefit from supplying steel and aggregates needed for rebuilding roads, bridges, and buildings. Energy Companies Firms specializing in energy infrastructure and renewables, such as NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE and General Electric Company GE, might participate in overhauling Ukraines energy systems. Technology Providers Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and Microsoft Corporation MSFT could be involved in restoring and upgrading Ukraines telecommunications and digital infrastructure. Commodities Likely to Benefit Steel and Copper The reconstruction efforts would increase demand for steel and copper, benefiting companies involved in mining and production of these metals.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"As of September 2024, the West continues to impose heavy sanctions and restrictions on imports of many Russian goods, particularly in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions.
