Energy Companies Firms specializing in energy infrastructure and renewables, such as NextEra Energy, Inc.

CSCO and Microsoft Corporation MSFT could be involved in restoring and upgrading Ukraines telecommunications and digital infrastructure. Commodities Likely to Benefit Steel and Copper The reconstruction efforts would increase demand for steel and copper, benefiting companies involved in mining and production of these metals. Cement and Lumber Suppliers of cement and lumber would likely see heightened demand as rebuilding efforts commence.

However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions. Admiteddly, severed all ties is a bit excessive, severed most of them is more accurate."

Lastly, if Samsung would bring it all the way to court, Iwerbäck assessed Samsung’s chances to be “slim or zero”."

Further down the road comes Apple, which is more likely to go all the way to trial. A settlement against Samsung would, however, add pressure on Apple (and Google). Redeye estimates that winning in court against Apple can give as much as USD121 per share to Neonode. Redeye thinks chances against Apple are slimmer than against Samsung, and estimates a 20% chance of the Neonode side winning in court against Apple. After that, there is more to chase from not only Google, but likely all smartphone OEMs. Redeye raises its fair value range."

Once a more definitive settlement figure is confirmed, stock price will react accordingly?!......hopefully more towards the $30 price target?!GOOD LUCK TO ALL STILL HOLDING ON THE STOCK!!In my case, I dumped about 80% of my holding, AFTER they initially lost the case to Apple and Samsung a few months back, at a heartbreaking average price of $2.50!! Fortunately, I still retained a few hundred shares for &#39; NOSTALGIA &#39; sake. This time, I&#39;ll hold on to the end!! Ha!!😂😂😂"
