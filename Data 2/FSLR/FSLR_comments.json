It generally has shown negative beta, and the stock seems to make random, out of sync moves compared to market. Today was an exception. Has shown strong buy volume spikes around 80."

Theyre expanding in other parts of the world but revenue at the moment is still very low. They have recently introduced products for commercial as well, but revenue is still very negligible. 2. I am not certain about FSLR. They produce panels especially for utility scale. With the recent tariffs on panels imported from China, they seem to be more in play. 3. ENPH has a decent moat on the microinvertor tech, but their strength is their ecosystem invertors, battery, EV chargers and energy management last two still fairly new and I anticipate at some point in the future, theyll charge customers a monthly fee as they would help the customer save money on Energy management because of dynamic tariffs in various geos a few years away though. I havent invested in FSLR but I am definitely interested in it."

Ive noticed that while both are very interest rate sensitive FSLR seems to hold up better when there is bad interest rates news. Which makes me think they will do well in favorable interest rate environment Seems they still able to show some earnings in a bad environment for their industry. ENPH less so. They are both best in class in the industry but if I had to pick one for long term it would be FSLR but I havent done a deep dive into their fundamentals. I expect both will pop on cuts but I think FSLR will maintain the pop where ENPH will not because of there is a lot of people underwater on ENPH."

Their narrow moat is a proprietary panel design and manufacturing process that reduces the cost per watt and is much less energy intensive to build. Chinese manufacturers are heavily subsidized by the state, and are a risk to FSLRs moat. Current protectionist policies are keeping them from flooding the market and crashing prices, but if policy changes it could wipe out their moat."

Grocery stores are good bets in times like these. Homebuilders MHO and GRBK are this week. Both should have great numbers. Theyve had a great past 6 months but recently declined, for no particular reason other than maybe investors moving away from home building. Fundamentals for both are exceptional. RCL is mentioned up there. Crazy momentum for this one, up 33 last 3 months. If they beat I could see a nice pop here but might also see people cashing out because of worries of general economic uncertainty, discretionary stuff gets crushed sometimes. Not sure how earnings will play out but Im bullish on the stock, adding to my position. TWLO, kinda beat up for part of this year, slow and steady recovery past few months, had a little bump last earnings that has continued. Investors have been cautious on this recovery but if they show continued improvement very likely people will pile in imo. MOD revised all projections upward mid quarter, theyve set the bar very high for themselves. Past year the stock is up 216. Still, I dont think its priced in, a lot of people are not aware of this company. Stock down 4 past week on a mild dip, primed for a bounce at earnings."

From their own webiste? For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, global comparable store sales declined 7, and consolidated net revenues declined 3 to 9.1 billion, or a 3 decline on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share is 0.80, down 25 over prior year. NonGAAP earnings per share is also 0.80, declining 24 on a constant currency basis. The companys results were primarily driven by softness in North Americas revenues in the quarter, specifically a 6 decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by a 10 decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4 increase in average ticket. The accelerated investments in an expanded range of product offerings coupled with more frequent inapp promotions and integrated marketing to entice frequency across the customer base did not improve customer behaviors, specifically traffic across both Starbucks Rewards and nonSR customer segments, resulting in lowerthanexpected performance. Additionally, China comparable store sales declined 14, driven by an 8 decline in average ticket compounded by a 6 decline in comparable transactions, weighed down by intensified competition and a soft macro environment that impacted consumer spending. Despite our heightened investments, we were unable to change the trajectory of our traffic decline, resulting in pressures in both our topline and bottomline. While our efficiency efforts continued to produce according to plan, they were not enough to outpace the impact of the decline in traffic, commented Rachel Ruggeri, chief financial officer. We are developing a plan to turn around our business, but it will take time. We want to amplify our confidence in the business, and provide some certainty as we drive our turnaround. For that reason, we have increased our dividend Our fourth quarter performance makes it clear that we need to fundamentally change our strategy so we can get back to growth and thats exactly what we are doing with our Back to Starbucks plan, commented Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer."

Investors probably did not like the bonuses and share based compensation paid this quarter putting a huge dent into eps, but those were committed based on performance and the company is performing. I was wrong on this one. still believe it has room to run, numbers are still great. MHO didnt move much, but beat earnings and revenue forecasts and continues its growth. GRBK seems to be dipping after hours today but didnt report yet. all home building stocks went down so may be a bigger commentary on the sector. Im being patient with these.

AMD did the same, meta was a similar story and i hesitate to say amazon will hit the same ground. For microsoft specifically MSFT has a double beat and misses guidance estimates general counsel as reported by Verge Microsoft published this one day before earnings fucking whinging about how google was trying to undermine them. Its conspiratorial, and excusemaking and it came from the general counsel so would have been signed off. I took that as a cue for low guidance even if earnings beat and got out with a 30 profit. in hindsight it was a dumb choice not to play puts as well, but hindsight is 2020.

Can you really setup a trade based on that? plus theres a chance itll fall to the previous high of 92.19 to build more of a base prior to any move up. Actually looking at the chart and momentum, it might make sense to buy puts with expectation of mediocre results like LLY and that the price is going toward 92.19."

Let us not forget the huge recall because of some seat defect and the one tredmill eating a kid. Seems like there is no more fuel for this thing to go up. Down like 97 percent from ATHs during the covid boom. The stock is probably shorted to all hell....

The difference with amazon s there has been no hype that I see anyway. THe stock has been steady at 184189 with a recient bump to 193 or so and back down which isnt a bad thing.

Also oil is down cause production is being ramped in foreign nations rn Libya is big one and israel just said they are not gonna attack iranian oil fields. Orange man isnt good for the economy unless you are rich, thats the truth. Same with his buddy elmo, who only cares cause Orange man wins and he gets to cut gov regulation over his entire empire. There is literally 0 redeeming factors for Orange man econ policy for avg person. Further, Orange man had 4 years and did nothing but give rich tax breaks and impoverished everyone else. Believe what you want, but nothing you said was factual, meanwhile you can google everything I typed up and find that my statements are actually true. Edit literally tell you all my family works in oil, including high level petro engineer jobs and wildcatters. Get told oil production isnt a wawa thing. Lol . No shit, but it also doesnt take 4 years to permit and drill a well. The reason production took a while to take off is again, cause banks didnt want to put money in more losing investments."

The price must move up faster than what the momentum of the stock was when you bought it. The opposite is true for puts. Almost always avoid buying any options within the first hour or two. Unless its a rare circumstance like Tesla was opening morning after earnings. Options value time decay increases rapidly the closer you get to the date of expiration. My advice to you would be to buy calls a month to three months out the day before earnings, so even if its not great, theres still time for it to recover."

The current admin and California want to force us into evs which are still mostly very expensive and destroys used car market availability. Grid cant handle more evs in CA already. The answer? Nuclear talk about permitting. The truth is we need all energy options on the table. Big oil isnt going away in my or your lifetime. We are in the clunky car phone phase of electric cars. Once we get to the smart phone era. Prices are lower on ev and perhaps oil will be truly less in demand. Currently a gallon of gasoline is still an efficient convenient form of energy. RUSSIA isdumping oil on the market under market value. Iran is pumping. What orange man wants is the us to be the leader in esporting our energy. Nat gas and oil and biden blocked pipelines that were permitted from doing just that. So politics aside europe can buy our gas or putins gas. China demand has been low due to economy. If that changes. A new president blocks and sanctions iran oil and ukraine war ends and russia gets oil back on market at market prices. Oil goes higher. But if lots of leases and production continue to come online the us energy engine that can also lower production if they want. They like to pump when oil is 75 or more. They take rigs down below 50. OIL has always been the most geopolitical commodity that wont change when orange man is president again. But having a prez that allows leases.

Another point, 1b value is a rounding error in todays valuation of companies. For a company with a solid heli model out there, full pro staff and, a huge factory buildout in progress and tangible interest with millions already invested and many more committed by blue chip companies and governments of many countries.... 1b is a joke."

Fluor Corporation FLR and Jacobs Solutions Inc. J might secure contracts for largescale engineering and infrastructure projects.

Energy Companies Firms specializing in energy infrastructure and renewables, such as NextEra Energy, Inc.

Commodities Likely to Benefit Steel and Copper The reconstruction efforts would increase demand for steel and copper, benefiting companies involved in mining and production of these metals.

However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions. Admiteddly, severed all ties is a bit excessive, severed most of them is more accurate."

For utility level solar, solar farms are proving themselves as reliable and extremely low upkeep cost at the same time as manufacturing them is getting incredibly cheap. Global installed solar capacity has been growing literally exponentially, doubling every 3 years. The more panels that are manufactured, the more economies of scale kick in, and it becomes even cheaper to make, making even not so sunny places cost effective for solar, even in the absence of sufficient grid level storage mechanisms. Which are also developing fast, just not exponentially like solar. In 10 years, solar will be the largest source of electrical power on the planet. Energy produced by them will cost less than half as much as the cheapest electricity to produce today. No politician can deny reality in the long term, as republicans are finding out as people whose homes are destroyed by flooding in the SE US are more likely to believe in climate change regardless of political leaning. Solar is going to be a huge part of the future, and most people dont see it yet. Of course having said this, many of the factors I just named mean that actual margins in the industry will probably go pretty low in the long term, and its going to be essentially impossible to establish a moat. So still hard to pick individual winners."

If Harris does win then this time next week Share price could easily be $250, then if there isnt a general stock market correction then yes $270+ by the end of the year is not unreasonable. If she loses then maybe $170 briefly but the markets have largely priced in a Trump win (for some reason)."

I don&#39;t see more than a 6% hit on the stock price between now through the weekend (~$187/share).I continue to think that many traders will want to head to the sidelines until Nov 8 given the expected volatility. Smart investors with a one-year outlook can take advantage here. And jump in on Nov 5. This is because the option market is predicting a lot of volatility between now through Nov 8: plus / minus 11% from current level of ~$192).However, I think that the political risk of a Trump win and GOP Senate control is overstated. Do your homework: the majority of the IRA solar tax credits are going to Red States. Tens of billions of dollars have been invested across Texas, Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana on the basis of the IRA tax credits. And tens of thousands of jobs in Red states are counting on this. There&#39;s no way that Congress is going to roll back solar tax subsidies. Additionally, both Harris and Trump will have tariffs that benefit FSLR (as a local manufacturer). And if Trump can pass a 15% corporate tax on local manufacturers, that&#39;s another tail-wind for FSLR.Good luck to all !"

But the expected move by Nov 8, 2025 from the current price is plus or minus 13.6%. That is, the option market thinks that by close of day Nov 8, 2025; FSLR could be as low as $173/share or as high as $228. Some insights here. The option market believes that the Election result will be known by Nov 8. And that FSLR will be strongly impacted. I&#39;m a contrarian here in that I think FSLR will do well over the next 12 months, irrespective of who wins the Election (given that Texas, Florida, and other Red States are the leading beneficiaries of IRA tax credits). So any significant fall the week of Nov 4th is an excellent buying opportunity. Opinions?"

This works with 100% tariff and 50% subsidy i.e.30/2/3 = 7.5c / W. Let&#39;s see if economics of volume will get ASP down to 15c / W for FSLR which at least only requires 100% tariff."

FSLR has an ASP of over 30c / W for fairly low performance panels i.e. 18%. I just bought 30kW retail over in Europe for 10c / W 21% efficiency. This is European manufactured panels with obviously Chinese cells that cost 3c / W. That is 1/3rd the ASP of FSLR and I paid retail. FSLR only works in the US due to 100% import tariffs combined with massive subsidies e.g. 50%. On the open market FSLR is not viable, and cannot sell outside the US, and any change in policy will massively affect their margin including -ve margin. This is the real reason this stock is going down. You cannot put a price target on the stock as you do not know which government will get in next ( right now its a coin flip ) or what they will do with climate change, e.g. say it is a hoax or double down on it. Hence FSLR is not a viable company on its own due to even Europe making panels far cheaper than they. FSLR in principle can make panels very cheaply using the CdTe thin film tech on glass so I would suggest they get streamlined to get their costs to about 6c / W finished panels, then they can compete at an ASP of 10c. Certainly you cannot predict where this stock will go. Frankly I would say zero tariffs and zero VAT like in Europe to promote uptake of solar rather than 100% tariffs like in the US. Who cares who makes the panels or where? Its all automated."

As they say, you&#39;re welcome ;) I will be watching to see if there was any reason for such a drop on such a highly profitable and perfectly positioned company to supply the rapidly growing renewable needs of the US and distributed generation. Really great company that is finally about to shine, I guess so long as the sun shines. but 8% drop on nothing? Hmmm."

That could happen if a Trump victory seems more likely of if Trump wins. I think FSLR will be fine even with Trump. Tariffs help FSLR given its local production. And its unclear if the Red states will want the tax credits removed - given the impact on jobs and growth. Texas and Florida currently are the top two states when it comes to solar investments; $46 billion and $22 billion respectively."

Waiting to see what potential impacts of the election may have on the longer term renewable energy industry. Our internal view is, as evidenced by some of the news that came out today and the number of congressmen that signed on, republican congressmen that signed on to a letter requesting that the IRA not be defunded and that information came out overnight significant.\n\nJust the fact that over 75% of the benefits from the IRA today are being experienced by republican controlled districts is an incredibly significant statistic. And these are about new jobs, factory openings, high paying solar industry jobs. So we feel that there&#39;s some stickiness to the IRA and certainly to the elements of the IRA related to what we care about within the subset of solar and within manufacturing credits and onshoring of manufacturing in the U.S &#34;\n\n\nwith 75 % of the Ira ( as it relates to solar) going to republican districts,  They are not going to allow the solar  incentives to be eradicated.\n\nI would also point out the Georgia and Texas lead the USA in solar installations. \nFlorida is also ramping up solar installations. \n\nThree red states with large areas of flatland ripe for installs .\n\nI would note that these states led the nation in solar install prior to ira and I don&#39;t see a worry as it relates to IRA .\n\nIra is going no where ."

So basically our growth the next couple years is twice the level of the PE.  We are severely undervalued.  Your fair value above of $465 is reasonable.  So with falling interest rates, a stable economy, an American supply chain, and the need for many more large scale solar farms to accommodate a surge in forecasted electricity demand, I feel quite comfortable holding long and strong America&#39;s #1 solar blue chip."

We&#39;re either going to pop higher from here to the high 240s in the short term like next several days, or we&#39;re going to drop below the current support levels on our way to bottoming around $175 at the lower end of the range before  turning higher.  The long term trend I see remains with both scenarios, as do all the bright fundamentals getting brighter, so I am holding long and strong regardless.  I think odds of popping higher from here are 3X better than the alternative, though most likely our sails will be blown in the direction of the S&amp;P 500."

You learn to take profits quickly. You could and should be all done for the day in about thirty minutes. You&#39;ll never catch the top 20% or the bottom 20%. It&#39;s super disciplined, and you have to stick to it, but still really tough. The great option traders wait for huge sell offs and scale in and get out when the V is done. Good luck. Better to buy a good stock and hold it. Or, like the movie &#34;War Games,&#34; better to not have played at all. If you lose more than $10,000 trading options you should never trade options again!!!! You can learn a lot by just trading one option and scaling each day. Still, a losers game.

These all happened in the current &#34;beneficial&#34; environment so I would argue that the economy having low inflation and interest rates is more beneficial than the political handouts.FSLR has had held up well since we supply to utilities that are still ramping up as AI is significantly increasing demand for electricity."
