So, a U investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it!

All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for U.

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects U) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of U to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous.

It&#39;s refocusing on improving its core technology and its advertising capabilities, and it&#39;s rebuilding relationships with developers.

The global mobile advertising market is worth $150 billion, and Unity has the potential to be a major player if it can get its act together. Outside of gaming, Unity is having some success winning customers across various industries building 3D tools and experiences. It&#39;s hard to pin down the exact size of Unity&#39;s total addressable market, but it&#39;s safe to say that it&#39;s much bigger than the $1.685 billion in strategic portfolio revenue the company expects to generate this year.

Yahoo,2024-09-12,"Reuters) - Unity Software is abandoning its &#34;runtime fee&#34; pricing policy, nearly a year after its announcement sparked considerable backlash from the videogame developer community.

The maker of the Unity Engine software said in a blog post on Thursday that it will revert to its &#34;existing seat-based subscription model for all gaming customers&#34; and implement price increases for its Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscriptions.

Shares of the company were up around 7% in afternoon trading.

The controversial pricing structure, announced in September last year, sought to charge new fees to game developers if certain revenue and install thresholds were met. The changes triggered a revolt among customers, hitting the company&#39;s share price and prompting it to roll back some aspects of the policy later that month.

&#34;It&#39;s our intention to revert to a more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis,&#34; Unity CEO Matt Bromberg said in a statement.

Unity Pro will see an 8% subscription price increase, while prices for Unity Enterprise will rise by 25%. The changes will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Following the &#34;runtime fee&#34; debacle, Unity announced a &#34;company reset&#34; cutting 3.8% of its global workforce and closing offices in 14 locations across various countries.",Neutral,0,0.5330647230148315,Main

Yahoo,2024-09-11,"If you look at a one to two year horizon from now I think the chances of this stock being double or triple the current price (16.75) is decent.  This, of course implies, the management being able to right the ship, and chart a course skillfully navigating the new opportunities which are emerging (3D, business, education.) while staying true to their gaming core.  The moat they have in their industry is wide and deep, and recent evidence indicates this has not eroded significantly despite all of the blatant mistakes that the former management made.  I am bullish for all of these reasons, but, as always, this is dependent upon execution, and to some extent overall market sentiment.

Yahoo,2024-09-07,"Here is a rundown of policy differences. This is not an endorsement.Mr. Trump recently stated that he supports reducing the top corporate income tax bracketfrom 21% to 15% in order to help companies like U to compete strongly against foreigncompetitors. 7 years ago, Mr. Trump spearheaded reducing the rate from 35% to 21%.Ms. Harris proposes increasing the top corporate rate from 21% to 28%, a 25% increase inincome tax U would have to pay instead of investing in it&#39;s growth.Mr. Trump wants to maintain the current long-term capital gains tax on sales of U stockat 15% and 20% for higher earners.Ms. Harris proposes taxing capital gains taxes as ordinary earnings. So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on U stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on U stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.
