If the companies they process payroll for add a job, thats another check they process, and of course the opposite for job losses. Since the ADP numbers come from their own live data there arent revisions to the ADP report. BLS nonfarm payrolls are primarily based off of survey results from businesses. Initial headline releases are based off of early responders and are revised over time as additional responses and other data come in. Hence, revisions."

When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks."

However if they announce stock splits or buy backs nothing will happen.

However the market likes this stock like christmas to it will go up. SBUX new CEO but probably not a lot of execution especially if he lives 5000 miles away. Analysts will grill them about turnaround plan and they wont have a clear answer to puts. EDIT SBUX published preliminary results and the stock is not moving, they wontt issue financial guidance. Not touching SBUX today. UBER might make another fat finger typo and add a 0 to profits so puts Peleton turnaround has begon since pandamic crash, calls SiriusXM warren buffet likes this stock, calls Mastercard for some reason VISA and Mastercard inverse each other so puts Intel Calls, how much worse can it get?

Grocery stores are good bets in times like these. Homebuilders MHO and GRBK are this week. Both should have great numbers. Theyve had a great past 6 months but recently declined, for no particular reason other than maybe investors moving away from home building. Fundamentals for both are exceptional. RCL is mentioned up there. Crazy momentum for this one, up 33 last 3 months. If they beat I could see a nice pop here but might also see people cashing out because of worries of general economic uncertainty, discretionary stuff gets crushed sometimes. Not sure how earnings will play out but Im bullish on the stock, adding to my position. TWLO, kinda beat up for part of this year, slow and steady recovery past few months, had a little bump last earnings that has continued. Investors have been cautious on this recovery but if they show continued improvement very likely people will pile in imo. MOD revised all projections upward mid quarter, theyve set the bar very high for themselves. Past year the stock is up 216. Still, I dont think its priced in, a lot of people are not aware of this company. Stock down 4 past week on a mild dip, primed for a bounce at earnings."

From their own webiste? For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, global comparable store sales declined 7, and consolidated net revenues declined 3 to 9.1 billion, or a 3 decline on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share is 0.80, down 25 over prior year. NonGAAP earnings per share is also 0.80, declining 24 on a constant currency basis. The companys results were primarily driven by softness in North Americas revenues in the quarter, specifically a 6 decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by a 10 decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4 increase in average ticket. The accelerated investments in an expanded range of product offerings coupled with more frequent inapp promotions and integrated marketing to entice frequency across the customer base did not improve customer behaviors, specifically traffic across both Starbucks Rewards and nonSR customer segments, resulting in lowerthanexpected performance. Additionally, China comparable store sales declined 14, driven by an 8 decline in average ticket compounded by a 6 decline in comparable transactions, weighed down by intensified competition and a soft macro environment that impacted consumer spending. Despite our heightened investments, we were unable to change the trajectory of our traffic decline, resulting in pressures in both our topline and bottomline. While our efficiency efforts continued to produce according to plan, they were not enough to outpace the impact of the decline in traffic, commented Rachel Ruggeri, chief financial officer. We are developing a plan to turn around our business, but it will take time. We want to amplify our confidence in the business, and provide some certainty as we drive our turnaround. For that reason, we have increased our dividend Our fourth quarter performance makes it clear that we need to fundamentally change our strategy so we can get back to growth and thats exactly what we are doing with our Back to Starbucks plan, commented Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer."

Investors probably did not like the bonuses and share based compensation paid this quarter putting a huge dent into eps, but those were committed based on performance and the company is performing. I was wrong on this one. still believe it has room to run, numbers are still great. MHO didnt move much, but beat earnings and revenue forecasts and continues its growth. GRBK seems to be dipping after hours today but didnt report yet. all home building stocks went down so may be a bigger commentary on the sector. Im being patient with these.

AMD did the same, meta was a similar story and i hesitate to say amazon will hit the same ground. For microsoft specifically MSFT has a double beat and misses guidance estimates general counsel as reported by Verge Microsoft published this one day before earnings fucking whinging about how google was trying to undermine them. Its conspiratorial, and excusemaking and it came from the general counsel so would have been signed off. I took that as a cue for low guidance even if earnings beat and got out with a 30 profit. in hindsight it was a dumb choice not to play puts as well, but hindsight is 2020.

Another major reason oil is down is because banks have begun limiting project exposure again to oil because banks literally have made negative money on oil investments over past 2 decades. Like 2 years ago they started funding again but not nearly as much as before. But they are starting to tighten back up in the background media never talks about this dynamic or its affects.

The difference with amazon s there has been no hype that I see anyway. THe stock has been steady at 184189 with a recient bump to 193 or so and back down which isnt a bad thing.

Also oil is down cause production is being ramped in foreign nations rn Libya is big one and israel just said they are not gonna attack iranian oil fields. Orange man isnt good for the economy unless you are rich, thats the truth. Same with his buddy elmo, who only cares cause Orange man wins and he gets to cut gov regulation over his entire empire. There is literally 0 redeeming factors for Orange man econ policy for avg person. Further, Orange man had 4 years and did nothing but give rich tax breaks and impoverished everyone else. Believe what you want, but nothing you said was factual, meanwhile you can google everything I typed up and find that my statements are actually true. Edit literally tell you all my family works in oil, including high level petro engineer jobs and wildcatters. Get told oil production isnt a wawa thing. Lol . No shit, but it also doesnt take 4 years to permit and drill a well. The reason production took a while to take off is again, cause banks didnt want to put money in more losing investments."

The price must move up faster than what the momentum of the stock was when you bought it. The opposite is true for puts. Almost always avoid buying any options within the first hour or two. Unless its a rare circumstance like Tesla was opening morning after earnings. Options value time decay increases rapidly the closer you get to the date of expiration. My advice to you would be to buy calls a month to three months out the day before earnings, so even if its not great, theres still time for it to recover."

Nuclear talk about permitting. The truth is we need all energy options on the table. Big oil isnt going away in my or your lifetime. We are in the clunky car phone phase of electric cars. Once we get to the smart phone era. Prices are lower on ev and perhaps oil will be truly less in demand. Currently a gallon of gasoline is still an efficient convenient form of energy. RUSSIA isdumping oil on the market under market value. Iran is pumping. What orange man wants is the us to be the leader in esporting our energy. Nat gas and oil and biden blocked pipelines that were permitted from doing just that. So politics aside europe can buy our gas or putins gas. China demand has been low due to economy. If that changes. A new president blocks and sanctions iran oil and ukraine war ends and russia gets oil back on market at market prices. Oil goes higher. But if lots of leases and production continue to come online the us energy engine that can also lower production if they want. They like to pump when oil is 75 or more. They take rigs down below 50. OIL has always been the most geopolitical commodity that wont change when orange man is president again. But having a prez that allows leases.

We dont even have to guess at a timeframe or anything. Just take what you would put in intel and calculate your balance in a high yield savings account over the next 2 years by month. That is literally what you are aiming to beat minimum, otherwise its actually a loss for your risk and effort. If in the next 30 days you sell for a 10 pop, great, but the company literally told everyone expect nothing for a year, and even after that, who boy, just know we are working hard and will update then. The longer you hold, the higher that needs to be just to beat the HYSA. Back to the short sightedness of the HYSA . 1 they probably are not doing that, its just a floor they are using to compare what they are doing with their money ex not giving two craps about a 1 dividend and trying to beat it. Their being smart and not marrying the play, stock or HYSA, and we all should be doing that. If the HYSA is no good, dump it and move to the next channel thats best at that time. The difference between intel and HYSA is you can get out of the HYSA at anytime with 0 loss and invest elsewhere, while Intel may have lost value. They 100 dont make perfect plays, but its hard for them to watch others make dumb plays that cant even track interest rates without saying anything. Bottom line, if you plan to be 100 passive, your picks are probably not best, especially if you refuse to pivot when terrible news shows up at the front page of every search engine. Thats why they keep screaming toss it in a fund to people who are doing this."

Its down to the price its at because its a shit company compared to what it was. It has an 87b market cap compared to Nvidias 2.6 TRILLION. They are in the same sector, yet Intel is worth 30x less even though they were founded 2 decades earlier. The really hilariously sad part is that you people are only touching the stock out of the fallacious human reasoning of surely it must go back up. If they beat earnings and pumped 25 that day instead of declined, none of you people would be touching it. Missed the boat, its overvalued but because it went down, your primal ape brain is telling you the only logical place for it to go now is back up.

Options were originally intended as a way to hedge your positions, and most hedge funds and serious investors still use them for that purpose. It works something like this Say i bought 10000 shares of nvda a couple years ago. Its gone up huge, lets say i paid 10 a share and theyre worth 100 a share now. I could buy long dated like years puts betting on it going to 50 or less. The puts would be very cheap for me to buy because thats very unlikely to happen but now in case something terrible does happen and nvda does crash my puts will pay off and i wont lose everything.
