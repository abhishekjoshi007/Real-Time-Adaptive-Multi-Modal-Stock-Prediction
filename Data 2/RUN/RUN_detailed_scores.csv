Reddit,2024-10-29,"Its not a dumb question at all. Im just getting into AI myself, but Ill try to explain. While there are some similarities to the product maturity cycle you mentioned, the convergence hypothesis in AI is a bit different. It suggests that as AI research progresses, different model architectures like GPT, PaLM, Claude, etc. might start performing similarly well at core tasks e.g., generating similar output for a given dataset, regardless of their specific design choices. Think of it less like product differentiation and more like how computer processors evolved while early CPUs had wildly different architectures, they eventually converged on some common fundamental principles. In AI, this could mean that the secret sauce shifts from having unique model architectures to having better training data and finetuning capabilities. This could affect NVIDIA because if model architectures become more standardized, the intense demand for specialized GPUs might slow down, as companies focus more on data quality than raw computing power for model innovation.",Neutral,0,0.8764684796333313,Reply

From my perspective, its conservative mgmt that has always beat and raised and outpaced analyst expectations theyve also called out in regards to 26 guidance that it didnt incorporate any new products which theyve had new launches since this guidance was released and will inevitably have more. I also personally disagree that a high growth fintech should be valued as a legacy bank most of which have sub 10 rev growth. If their tech platform really accelerates and gets deals with large financial institutions itll be hard to ignore its part of the valuation delta vs banks. Theyve also leaned into originating for other companies no capital loan origination and loan servicing revenue where they dont take on risk. Its possible that growth completely stagnates in 27 but I dont think itll be that mature of company by then.

Reddit,2024-10-28,"Oil down 5, natgas down 8, what inflation? Bond yields up 1, suggesting higher real growth which is great for small caps. Still looking to buy more long duration, 3.5 GDP growth isnt sustainable, Fed is targeting 2 long term, and yields in the long run always moves opposite to inflation. However, will wait for election to pass. Just based on the math, 50 Trump will win and very likely republicans sweep President and Senate, House still a toss up, but a Dem sweep is not going to happen. 2016, yields jumped after Republicans swept, likely a repeat this time which will probably mark a top in yields. Bad policies like tariffs are scary if we assume the numbers stay the same, but is unlikely to happen to that extreme extent. A Trump victory also makes UkraineRussia peace more likely to happen, not necessarily in a good way for Ukraine, but that also means lower commodities inflation. Edit Bad policies like tariffs are scary Also, whilst tariffs will usually increase the price of goods, it doesnt mean long duration yields rise as a result of inflation. This is because tariffs also increase the chance of recession through lower employment as firms put cutting workers as an alternative to raising prices. If this is becomes pervasive, prices might not increase much, but real purchasing power falls dramatically as unemployment rises, so bond yields also dump. So if there was a trump trade for bonds then the play is to buy when he wins on higher chance of tax cuts and have upside if a large enough tariff that causes recession might happen.",Negative,-1,0.7750738263130188,Reply

For example, Norways ID card is their drivers license, debit card, and credit card. They have a state bank account, but private groups can also tap into the ID cards chip to verify their identity. If the US or US states started doing that, everymany Americans would immediately have a trusted card that could be used by Visa, MC, etc. Similarly, nearly everyone has a smart phone with Apple Pay and Google Wallet. Its only a matter of time before they make their own cards and immediately cut into that market. That said, if the US or any states were actually interested in ending Visas monopoly, theyd have already started down that path.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Reddit only lets me create one table per post. Sigh, technology. Last week I talked with ucreemeeseason about how to play what appears to be a longterm bull gold market. In my view, the large cap gold companies are suspect at the moment and dont present a strong case from either margin of safety or efficient cash generation. They were the first names to recover from the harrowing mid2010s bear market while the midtiers and juniors languished, plus their portfolios are saddled with a slew of exhausted mines further compounded by high operating jurisdictional costs. Although these companies have the cash reserves to go on MA sprees, they arguably remain the worst candidates in the field until they acquire those properties. I think it will be most useful to display this in raw data. Here are the PE and EPS, with the addition of FY2025 projections and current investor pricing, of the miners and royaltystreaming companies above 10 billion in market cap. Market cap is measured in millions USD and EPS is measured in USD as well. All values are of last Friday. Im using UAFRS data instead of GAAP GAAP financial statements are not reliable. Note, IDCF Inverted DCF. Normally you use a DCF model to infer the intrinsic value of a company and whether current prices make it a bargain. You can do the opposite and reverseengineer investor assumptions regarding the companys future performance. Here Im comparing what these values would need to be to justify current prices versus analyst projections for FY2025.

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Sure but lets take a 50,000 foot view touching on just one of these. Around a year ago I saw a credible presentation by AEM CEO essentially saying they make good money if gold is above 1700, and every buck above is exponentially better. My thesis was gold would be in strong global demand for the foreseeable future, and thus it was a no brainer to load up AEM around 70. He also explained that besides the threat of gold price collapse, another big risk for them is energy costs. If those were to spike, it could temper their profits. Energy has remained low. Lastly he explained that as miners their earnings lag commodity price. Everything that needed to happen for AEM to succeed has happened. And the fundamentals are even better today than a year ago. Gold is certainly well above 1700, energy is low and not threatening to rise. If the CEO was truthful in saying their earnings lags the commodity price bump, it suggests theyve got some big earnings already in the pipeline. Your analysis would suggest dumping AEM after this run, and my own habit is typically to sell and take profits on big, shorter term windfalls. Yet the fundamentals for owning it are even better than a year ago. How would you resolve this?",Positive,1,0.9653065800666809,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-23,"As successful as Embraer has been, their commercial aircraft fleet is basically the E175190 series. They are really good jets....but really fell behind Airbus with the A220. The A220 has the same operating cost as the E190, but it has 1520 more seats and can fly transcontinental US flights. Of course, the A220 was originally the C series developed by bombardier in Canada, but the costs of developing it basically bankrupted the company and they were forced to sell it to Airbus for a pittance. This isnt the first time a plane maker almost went belly up from development costs. Boeing almost went under multiple times, most famously from the 747. Its also why Embraer doesnt want to develop a rival to the 737A320 series, despite Boeings problems....its just a massive undertaking. Theres also a lot of institutional knowledge needed. Its speculated that Boeing might not be capable of developing a totally new jet at this point because they no longer have people with the experience of doing so. Its been 15 years since Boeing released the 787, and that was not a very well executed development. The 777 is considered the peak of Boeing development and that debuted in the mid 1990s, nearly 30 years ago. Not many people left from those days.",Positive,1,0.9487416744232178,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-23,"Same overblown doom arguments were made last year when there were bond vigilantes pushing 10Y to 5. Im neither a bond vigilante nor a doomer. A 10year rate around 5.56 is normal in historical terms. We had this in the earlymid 90s during high economic growth with very little fiscal spending contributing to GDP as well as before the rampant inflation of the late 70s. My personal expectation is that it will settle at 4.254.50 for the foreseeable future. Were still getting rate cuts even if recent news suggests they will be doled out slower than anticipated. And Fed easily brought it down to 3.6 with not much effort or hurting the fight on inflation. The Fed doesnt have control over longterm rates. This is a common misconception. The FFR is the overnight rate and it directly influences Tbills and SOFR. Yet as were currently seeing, the 10year, mortgage, and credit card rates have moved in the opposite direction. I really dont think Im going to lose the bet. And yes... some form of YCC is now a permanent part of modern monetary policy and it really isnt a problem at all. I think you would because youre assuming inflation is a beast the Fed has control over. If it was just a monetary phenomenon, then that would be a feasible hypothesis. Unfortunately, the economic conditions of the 2010s that allowed them to maintain ZIRP at a small price will no longer exist by the end of this decade. In fact, theyll probably be gone by 2026 if the Permian basin rolls over. Beyond the supplyside dynamics, the Fed also has no choice but to accept a higher level of inflation. Akin to the 1940s, the main way the government will address its debt burden is to reduce it to a nominal value they will inflate it away. The fact that YCC is now considered permanent means its a problem. There is no compelling reason why the market cant determine rates via price discovery. Governments typically adapt YCC as a last resort when everything else has failed. That doesnt mean they are going to flatten the curve to 0 but continuing to manage the curve to maintain liquidity and financial stability is just good policy. You only need to maintain liquidity and financial stability if the system is inherently unstable.",Negative,-1,0.5979208946228027,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-21,"The mods removed it for no spam or self promotion for some reason, oh well, guess Ill just keep my thoughts to myself. It was the Twitter link. Preliminary thoughts Based on the neural net data Ive been perusing over the summer, I believe Permian shale production is going to roll over in 20252026. The massive increase in tight oil in the last decade has primarily come from drilling the most productive wells in Tier 1 regions highgrading in industry parlance and frontloading the gains. If my thesis is correct and highgrading was the driving force, we should see the Permian decline in a similar way to Eagle Ford and Bakken between now and 2030. Simultaneously, breakeven prices for tight oil will soar as producers are forced to drill through tough rock instead of permeable sediment. Considering 90 of all nonOPEC production growth since 2015 has come solely from this region, it will reverse the dearth of capex in the oil gas industry. Capital discipline and offshore investment are antithetical no company will invest billions into a drilling rig that takes decades to pay off unless they believe oil prices will have a higher floor than current prices. Weve seen the majors rely on MA and partnerships in foreign countries instead of dedicating their own capital to projects. If the specter of tight supply gains a foothold in futures, offshoring becomes economically feasible again. On a companybycompany basis, VAL and RIG are dead in the water pun intended. TDW and NE are the top choices. With a supply crunch in ships looming on the horizon, I slightly prefer TDW as the play on this subsector.",Neutral,0,0.9893136620521545,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-21,"What are you basing this on? And at some point is not very relavent if its not in the foreseeable future which it almost certainly isnt. Solar and wind power will continue to be used and invested in for many decades to come at the minimum. Further in the future where fossil fuels are no longer used for electricity, even if nuclear is more cost effective solar will still be used. We will want different forms of energy as back ups. Nuclear plants come with huge costs to built and huge costs for disposal of waste. They also need maintainance, during which time they cant provide electricity. Theres no logical reason why people would turn their backs on solar or wind entirely, and they are expected to grow a lot. We simply dont have to choose one, and one being more cost effective doesnt make the others obsolete. Were not talking about a company offering the same thing for a lower price making another company pointless, were talking about the lifeblood and infrastructure of the tech heavilyreliant future civilisation. And apart from needing to transition from fossil fuels, electricity usage will likely continue to increase dramatically.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"Ive reviewed the Fuzzy Panda allegations and a few of the investigations by law firms. The key allegation relates to the purported expiration of CARES Act ESSER funding in September and the idea of an earnings cliff, which is completely spurious. The date they refer to is the expiration for commitment of funds by states. Spending will continue until January 28, 2025. Fuzzy Panda implies that somehow Stride has hidden this source of revenue in their bottom line, which is also false. ESSER funding goes to the states, who then allocate it to school districts, who allocate it to schools who allocate it to providers in their budgets. As such, Strides ESSERrelated funding derives from school district budgets, not directly from ESSER. We could expect a dropoff in EBITDA in late January, 2025 if a significant number of states reduce overall school district funding, especially for charter schools, or move away from the online learning or hybrid learning models. While those are real concerns for next year, they will remain amorphous until Q3 2025 earnings are reported. The rest of what is mentioned is innuendo in that it comes from former employees whom we can assume would be dissatisfied in some way if willing to speak so badly of their former employer. I did not see any corroborating evidence cited other than these statements, so..., they could be true, they could be not true, but many do not appear to have material impact on EBITDA regardless their truth or falsehood.

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Some people may luck out in deflation. For example, if someone owned 50 of their investments in bonds and tbills, the price of the bonds would go up as rates are lowered to zero percent again. During deflation when nobody wants to spend money or borrow at 3 to buy a home, the bond holders could sell some highpriced bonds to the QE banks when bond prices are high and rates are low, and buy houses at bargain prices during times of super low mortgage rates. This is why its good to keep a few bonds in your investments because the next recession or depression cycle could unexpectedly appear at any time.

In other words, we do not want to stifle the animal spiritor momentum of the economy, since it takes a long time to get it back again. Back in 2009 both the federal govt and fed did not do much hence the recovery took a very long time. Feds biggest worry is wage price spiral which was a problem after pandemic due to labor shortage, now it does not seem to be a problem since companies are not hiring aggressively. That said, I dont think Fed is going to cut rates aggressively, rates are not very high at the moment, we do not want inflation to come back again, that will set things back. They will go slow and easy, 25bps cuts, unless inflation is really down below 2.5 consistently, at the moment it is not below 2.5 and it is too early, we had only like 45 months of inflation below 3.",Negative,-1,0.9987767338752747,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-13,"Tell me you dont know anything about economics without telling me you dont know anything about economics. Deflation is bad for the economy because it discourages spending, investment, and consumption at the macro level. Sure, deflation would benefit inelastic essentials like food, but in a service based economy that relies heavily on capital investment and consumption, 8 deflation over several years would have disastrous effects. Deflation increases the purchasing power per dollar, which on the surface sounds good until you realize it also means wages will go down. It also discourages investment at all levels since rampant deflation would create a sentiment that its better to hold off since you can get more for your money later on. Why take the risk investing in the market or investing in RD if you could earn 8 just having the money sit in a bank account. High deflation would also decimate people with mortgages or loans since the payments on the loan remain the same while the purchasing power per dollar and their wages would be going down. So their monthly mortgage payments would be going up over time in real terms. High inflation is also bad, but a small amount of inflation like 2 benefits everyone because it means spending and investment is encouraged since money is losing 2 of its value if its doing nothing, and payments on mortgages and loans go down in real terms over long periods.

There is no smaller model Y that many hoped for and two seat vehicles have some of the lowest numbers among traditional cars.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Tesla the auto manufacturer is worth maybe 10share. Tesla the were doing stuff with AI company is worth ???share. So like with NVDA clueless investors are mashing the buy button and itll work... until it doesnt. The music will stop and the share prices will tank. It will take probably years, but eventually the shareholders of TSLA will realize they were sold a bill of goods. Lots of talk about the potential of AI, not a lot of action. FSD is harder than most humans can imagine. Most humans, most TSLA shareholders, have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA how to train a machine learning model to drive a car. They falsely believe that hey Tesla is close, it already kind of drives itself, how much farther can FSD be? In the world of data science and machine learning, getting a model to be right about 80 of the time is relatively easy. This 80 accuracy target is often good enough. Its okay if the ML model is wrong 20 or even 30 of the time for example, when I go to the dentist for my 6month cleaning, my dentist has this AI dental thing look at my XRays and point out potential problem areas. Last time I went, it found around 6 problem areas now Ive been seeing this dentist for almost a decade, hes never had to do a filling or any other restorative work, I use a Sonicare toothbrush, etc. So as you can guess, he looks at all the problem areas and writes them off. Basically a thanks for the help, AI, but everythings okay! He explained that its nice to have a second set of eyes but he of course doesnt trust it to make any decisions. ChatGPT is similar. Its wrong a lot. Hard to put a percentage figure on it but I would say as someone who uses it daily, its wrong AT LEAST 20 of the time. This is also fine, as it has disclaimers everywhere, even in some of its responses saying hey man I could be wrong. On the other hand, for usecases where even being wrong 2 of the time is unacceptable, as with driving a fucking car, relying solely on AI is, currently, impossible. Im not aware of anything be it cars, robots performing surgery, or those bullshit Optimus robots that is accurate enough to not need a human monitoring it. This is why Tesla says not to nap while your car is in autopilot mode on the interstate. The interstate is, as AI driving software goes, the easiest test of abilities. Minimal traffic signs, roads are large and relatively straight, no pedestrians... I would guess for this ideal scenario, Teslas selfdriving machine learning model is 90 accurate. This is where youre least likely to die from sleeping in your Tesla while its driving. Still a nonzero chance youll die, but relatively low. But FSD stands for full selfdriving, so it must be able to deal with city driving pedestrians, school zones, windy roads, stop signs, other drivers driving unpredictably... this is MANY times more difficult than teaching a computer to drive on an interstate highway. I would describe it as something like 100x more difficult. Its not just a little more difficult this is where I think most TSLA shareholders are naively speculating on Tesla The AI Company. And of course there are many other companies competing with Tesla in this space. Not just Wemo. I can go on the internet and for a thousand bucks buy a device that hooks up to my dumb cars computer and will give it similar selfdriving capabilities to Teslas. Identical if I recall correctly. Neither than truly FSD, but... the point is, heres proof that teaching a computer to drive on the interstate is EASY so many other companies can do it. The one Im thinking of is Comma AI Im a software engineer who trains machine learning models for a living. I probably know more than anyone else here about how realistic FSD is Where it gets tricky is the stock play. Stocks can remain irrational longer than most people can remain solvent... so while I personally am convinced TSLA is overpriced vaporware, it could rally to 1000share before the rest of the world comes to the same conclusion. Theres also the possibility that Elon continues to stall successfully until they really do figure out FSD to be clear, I think FSD will happen eventually. I also think Tesla will announce they have solved FSD long before they actually do, release it, and well eventually see some deadly failures in the realworld akin to Boeings MCAS on the 737 MAX. I have no doubt in my mind Tesla will release a defective FSD calling it perfect, and then people will die, theyll recall it, the stock will tank as its done many times before, people go back to betting on the future of AI, rinse, repeat. So yeah, Ive been playing with the stock market for over a decade. Mixed success of course. My opinion is that TSLA will remain very volatile until a competitor figures out true FSD. I dont see how current technology will actually facilitate a 99100 accurate ML model for city driving. I see this as being over a decade away. I will be VERY skeptical of any claims of FSD from Tesla or anyone else prior to that. In the meantime, playing off those Elon Tweets and fake Optimus robot demos will be tricky. I think theres lot of money to be made for those who successfully navigate the spikes and dips of TSLA over the next decade.",Neutral,0,0.9727066457271576,Reply

In my opinion there should be some sort of laws similar to antitrust laws where instead of forcing companies that have monopolies to split up, companies where an individual has too much power can be forced to make that individual sell off shares to a certain level, lets say 10 percent just for example. That way the government doesnt have to take ownership of Spacex and Elon Musk would pose a less significant risk with only 10 percent ownership, and capitalism is not disrupted although this should be of little consideration when national security is at risk.

The problem is scaling production and so much money was already thrown into them, while payouts from utilization are yet to bear fruit. I think cash flow will dramatically increase in coming years and give the company room to grow. The negative scenario is that competition is very tough inside China and tariffs will impact somewhat the chane to sell to Europe and USA.

GDP growth in China is reported you by your friendly CCP representative and has always been highly questionable. In other words, no matter how bad we know a year was in China, if Xi says its 5 GDP growth, do you suppose that there is an auditor anywhere in China who will stand up and say no? Without disappearing the next day? This is exactly the problem with their businesses auditing as well. Do you think any auditor has the courage to report something bad about a CCP sponsored business without putting their family or themselves at risk? China is a NOT a free speech nation.

If it were lower than 2 right now the risk of overshooting would look too great as interest rates are still high and likely still pressuring inflation downwards, and are lagging. On top of this the jobs report indicated that the economy is still looking pretty healthy, making a recession not look very likely. There was some talk about jobs openings being better than expected is bad for the chances of further cuts. Im really struggling to see the rationale behind this thinking. I think some people have gotten a little confused by the meaning of the data and what the fed are trying to achieve. There is very little reason why this positive jobs report would cause the fed to hesitate more on their cutting as long as inflation continues to look good. They would be shooting themselves in the foot if they did this, because right now the balancing act they are trying to pull off with interest rates appears to be working out perfectly.

Reddit,2024-10-09,"It really started spiking while the last missile barrage over Israel was still happening, but it kept going up through the bullish pause in the port strike. I think that many big traders dont want to be taxed selling their profitable long positions, but they want a volatility hedge. But right now, it seems like the market is not pricing a major escalation in the Middle East, other than through the VIX and oil. I think if Israel doesnt hit Irans oil or nuclear infrastructure, then thats the bestcase scenario for markets. I currently have a cash hedge in case things escalate in a major way, because I have ridiculous and builtup concentration risk in some of the favorite hedgefund playthings, like NVDA, TSM, and AVGO. Two countries that are bristling with missiles can cause very significant economic dislocations, with lots of deaths, and algos can sell off fast. Its a scary escalationprone situation, because there is no way to be sure of a warheads payload Usually, geopolitical conflicts dont have much impact on U.S. stocks, but that is definitely not always true. Right now, we are in a Cool War with a loose axis of authoritarian states that include Iran. Broadly, a major escalation between Israel and Iran is not a great development for oil prices or the global economy. I saw a hawkish comment by Israel today and Netanyahu just talked with Biden, which apparently is for the first time in weeks, in a break with historical norms. So Israels response is at the top of my list of concerns, followed by LT treasury prices. But, other than those factors, I am looking forward to earnings season.

Reddit,2024-10-09,"1.

If a breakup of GOOGL is net positive for shareholders and GOOGL is not doing it, then that means the management is not maximizing shareholder value. 3. GOOGL can have a high market beating return after a theoretical breakup, and we will have no way to discern what role the breakup had. The logical assumption would be positive stock returns postbreak up is DESPITE the breakup strong underlying businesses rather than because of the breakup. So, I think any forced breakup of GOOGL is a net negative for shareholders but whether GOOGL continues as one company or multiple companies, the stock will yield positive returns because they should still grow and be profitable regardless. The only problem is that if GOOGL is broken up and the separate companies deliver positive returns and is worth more than GOOGL is today, people may erroneously claim the breakup was the cause without being able to demonstrate any cause and effect.",Positive,1,0.9998818635940552,Reply

Sounds like youre just making up a whataboutism though so Ill move on... The only way to protect kids is to completely shut off the internet for kids.

Im not sure why you assume Im thinking the burden of raising kids is their job. The fact of the matter is when you make a product for primarily kids, you take on the responsibility to make it safe. Adding social features meant they took on that moderation responsibility. If they cant handle that then parents will just stop allowing their kids to play it.

Practically every other country does, we dont and politicians at this point choose not to. In the case of obesity and diabetes PBMs drive up list prices during negotiations so they can get favorable rebates. PBMs are middlemen that are also publicly traded like Cigna and CVS so they stand to lose more performance wise if they dont keep those prices high. NVO could slash prices and still keep a very healthy margin and potentially even sell more volume, but if they dont agree to PBM list prices they risk getting removed from their formularies which means lower sales all together and people not getting medication from NVO.

Reddit,2024-10-02,"HIMS is something Im a bit weary of. They have an oral medication thats only a shortterm treatment, and its not a compounded medication so it would be less effective than your traditional GLP1. Plus from what I understand its 2400 upfront for a year or something like 250400 per month. Being noncompounded its not as effective and not intended to be a long term treatment. So it doesnt work for everyone and I dont think its covered by insurance. In that regard it sounds like a niche market. It should be noted that none of what it sells is FDA approved. Not sure if this would really affect their oral medications. As for the GLP1 HIMS recently began offering, this would be compounded and can be a longer term treatment, but my understanding is theyre only allowed to sell this in the first place because theres a shortage right now. Ifwhen Nordisk ends its shortage on GLP1s I think the FDA at that point would demand HIMS to pull GLP1s from their shelves. So yes, they do have that loophole to sell without approval because of the shortages, but at the same time we dont even know if HIMS is violating patents or is unsafe and ineffective as far as their GLP1s go. Personally, Im not a fan of tossing someone desperate to lose weight who took a 10 minute survey and never talked to a doctor some drugs to inject into themselves. Dont know if when all is said and done FDA approved GLP1 makers or the FDA would be okay with this either so IMO its sounding real risky.",Neutral,0,0.9820246696472168,Reply

This 20 drop is probably insignificant in the grand scheme of things. If you got in a year ago this is just regular variability of a crazy hot stock. And sure, demand has probably increased over the past year, but I dont think revenue from this drug has increased dramatically from this drug to explain this 2x increase in company value. So to me, this just feels like FOMO and people wanting to take profits. Again, I do not have a finance background.

My hope is the government embarks on some structural reforms and do more to support aggregate demand.

Reddit,2024-10-02,"We were talking about business fundamentals, just aggregate for you and individual for me. The perception of where aggregate business fundamentals are headed drives risk taking. For example, IWMs earnings for 2024 have cratered by 37 since the beginning of the year despite pricing in rate cuts from January onwards 2025 analyst estimates have dropped 15. Yet the index is currently trading at a blended 27 PE from 19 last year. People are willing to pay more for that basket even though it is predicted to perform worse because they think earnings will be better. For individual stocks, aggregate is mostly noise. Its not. The driving forces behind price movement are investor sentiment and liquidity. The former is driven by the perception of marketwide risk, and it predictably trickles down to certain sectors depending on whether the attitude is riskon or riskoff. And for indexes for nooby retail, they will read ideas like your OP as reasons to not invest and end up never investing, mistaking short term characteristics as longterm predictors. Well, I cant help that. I made it clear in my original post I was talking about shortterm expectations. My prediction is that the SP and Nasdaq will start sustained retracing as soon as Friday.

Reddit,2024-10-01,"Something to keep in mind, is that SPY is the global hoover of savings and retirement funds, much more so now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. 2 of your 3 crash examples from PE ratio going over 30 were from an era where the average person didnt really have any involvement in the stock market. Nowadays, SPY and other various SP500 trackers literally hoover up peoples personal savings, from across the globe. Even on countries like mine England where pensions are more powerful than the US, around 23 of the population invests in the stock market, most people set it and forget it on an automatic monthly investing schedule. The top two ETFs people go for here is VWRP and VUAG, the first one being an all world tracker with 23 of its weight in the SP 500, and the second one just being a straight up SP 500 tracker. And this is in the U.K we dont invest in the FTSE 100, Japanese people arent investing in the Nikkei, mainland Europeans arent investing in the STOXX 50, etc. Everyone across the globe invests one way or another in the US stock market, specifically SP 500. Most people arent active trader types, they just have a monthly direct debit so it automatically buys into the SP 500 for them every month. Even 10 years ago this wasnt really much of a thing. But with investingbroker apps being so mainstream and easy to access on phones, theres massive amounts of people investing in the US stock market. Much more so than there was in the era of the GFC or the dot com bubble. Like I said, nowadays it is literally the global hoover of everyones personal savings.

Reddit,2024-10-01,"Increase in PE ratio cold be explained by the proliferation of index funds and retail investing over the past decade and a half. If more money comes in it has to go somewhere the mag 7 and sp 500 is a self fulfilling prophecy in this respect. In demand companies get more attention which increases the premium on their shares, combine that with the set it and forget it invest in everything with the highest market cap index investing which is the most popular these days and you have an increase in overall PE as the largest weighted companies demand even more money from every dollar put into broad market index funds as the attention and short term performance attracts more growth investors. Ever heard of APA Corporation? How about Catalent Inc? Well if you bought any SP500 index fund you bought a little bit of that too. everyone has. So theres a little bump on the premium for those smaller companies there too and as the heavy weighted companies eat up market cap and consolidate with other like minded successful enterprises through MA you get a lower quality bottom of the list than you had previously, except theyre being bought more aggressively than a long time ago by passive investors who buy the market. The introduction of ETFs, the move to defined contribution from defined benefit retirement plans, and the increased popularity of retail investing created a brand new environment in the market never seen before. Unlike the Great Recession, Great Depression and tech crash, these are not bubbles as much as they are paradigm shifts in how we as a society invest our personal wealth. The market is simply more busy with more players than it has ever been before. That may be something to consider when looking at the increased PE you mentioned. As for the banks and their losses. These treasuries they hold are the safest investments you can purchase. As such, the banks have the ability to mark to maturity if they can verify their full intent to hold them to maturity. While your right that if there is a bank run there could be forced liquidation and trouble, your wrong in saying there are unrealized losses on their books because these losses cant materialize in the first place. Regardless, as interest rates are cut these t notes will increase in value. Now for interest rates. The printing of money does not itself create inflation and the inflation phenomenon is not as simple a supply and demand like many think. The increased supply of money does not create less demand for it and as a result increase prices. Its increased credit that promotes consumer spending and increased government spending that adds money to the private sector that creates inflation. So to say rate cuts are not possible is not all that accurate and it really depends on whether and when we will arrive at the feds neutral interest rate.",Neutral,0,0.9950810074806213,Reply

Yes, the SP is overweight tech and that may be scary but if you look at the difference between the last two bubbles and especially the late 90s, earnings for tech are actually keeping up with these high valuations. Regional banks have already started to refinance CRE loans and in the event they do fail the FDIC will insure it and a big bank can collect it and consumers will be just fine. Our deficit is concerning but not as big of a problem as media makes it in my opinion... the US dollar is the worlds reserve currency, currencies are pegged to our dollar and central banks hold our dollar in reserves. The chances of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA defaulting on its debt anytime soon is little to none imo ofc. Political division has always been there and as long as its not WW3 global tensions wont make countries hate us more than they already do lol. Also, were not Argentina lol.

Reddit,2024-10-01,"Unless the USA stops being the economic superpower of the world, I doubt it. People from across the globe dont chose the SP 500 because theyre a big fan of America, they chose it because theres nowhere else in the globe that offers such a good mix of massive growth stocks and matured global mega corps. For example, I will never invest in the UKs FTSE 100 because its comprised of very matured and boring companies that see almost no growth, its the same case with Europe. Banks and Insurance dominates. Ive spoken to people from Hong Kong and China who rather invest in the SP over their countries indexes for similar reasons and also because you can be certain that business will always be stable in the US, you cant say that for ChinaIndia etc. Basically, america is just the most attractive place in the world to invest in because it sees the best growth whilst also being the most reliable and stable. You think a world ending 20 crash for the SP 500 is bad, look at the SP China 500. Roughly 28 in 2018, 52 crash from 20212022. Indias Nifty 50 has performed really well and stable actually, but even so, theyll invest in the US. Until America stops seeing monster growth mixed in with matured mega corps and pretty much unrivalled economic stability and security, people wont stop pouring their savings into it. And the strongest military in the world defends that economys interests. Also a side note, I dont see the US stock markets growth elements dying any time soon either, largely because the best and brightest workers and entrepreneurs in the world all go to America because A the best and brightest workers get paid better and B the entrepreneurs with ideas for the next big thing go to America because its the easiest place to get Venture Capital funding, its the startup capital of the world. Conversely, this is an issue for the U.K. and Europe I know of this first hand, and likely India and China aswell, because theres a thing called brain drain. Its a real issue in my country and all of Europe, and its basically the concept I just explained. Our nations smartest people leave us to go to America because they can get double, triple the pay if not more. Hence the name brain drain, the US hoovers up all the smart people in the world. So I dont personally think that people will lose confidence in the US stock market any time soon simply for the fact that I dont see any other country becoming a more attractive place to invest in any time soon Americas closest rival is china, and no one wants to touch Chinese stocks with a 10 foot barge pole relatively speaking ofcourse.",Neutral,0,0.9171133935451508,Reply

So, is there no value? Is one of the biggest clubs in the world worthless? For a company the generates 100mm to 200mm in organic cash flow per year? Yeah, Id say theres a good bit of value in there. This fact is further backed up when looking at MANUs trading multiples which all are in a fairly reasonable range of 18.0x 13.0x on an Firm Value EBITDA basis and 17.0x 8.0x on a Market Cap OCF basis..... Id argue that Manchester United, like other sports clubs, arent valued, as theres no significant positive free cash flow. Instead, they are being priced. They are in the same group as Pokemon cards, antiques, and art paintings. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Except, the beholders are billionaires, and theyre likely going through a checklist.

Just raised membership dues, first time in 45 years, so that drops to the bottom line with little churn due to their loyal customer base.",Positive,1,0.9999998807907104,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-26,"Costco is in more affluent areas. Walmart went for cheap real estate, while Costco specialized and saw the value in convenience in paying more for RE but catering to a more affluent customer base. Specialization is the hedge against competition. Much like developing a niche in an ecosystem. Costco has a lot of solid qualities their payable days exceed inventory, so they have no working capital need when it comes to inventory. Its covered. That provides positive cash flow. their own brand Kirkland accounts for 2030 of sales, because of the contrast principle. Kirkland is often placed against 1 national brand, and often appears to be a significant bargain, whereas by itself it wouldnt appear so. So in contrast to the 1 or otherwise very few competing brands it appears to be the better choice, and so Kirkland makes up a high of sales. their membership fees make up half their pretax operating margin. Membership fees grow by 8 a year in volume, and they just raised prices by 8, and this is where much compounding of the business comes from, not the retail side which is low margins but high turnover. their average store sales which can be seen in the annual report grow significantly over time, doubling every 7 years or so. They also only add a constant 20 stores per year, or close to that. Very stable consistent growth. much of this works together to give them high returns on invested capital, and high returns on equity. They buyback shares and pay dividends. The phenomenal declining and now 2day cash conversion cycle. They are a compounding machine. self reinforcing durable competitive advantages. Costco has high demand, which along with its footprint gives it the economies of scale for favorable supplier terms and prices that allows it to buy large quantities of inventory it sells out of its warehouses at wholesale prices, 2030 from its own label keeping costs lower and passing it down. The low prices attract its customers, and so you have these self reinforcing durable competitive advantages of scale, low costs, brand loyalty and repeat customers.",Positive,1,0.9999998807907104,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-26,"Thanks. Well, theres plenty like Costco, business models I really admire but prices that dont make sense to buy at. Closest Ive seen, more of a fair value than a steep discount, is Hershey. Ive been buying it since December, every time it falls to 180. Up to 138 shares and hoping to double down. The main 2425 cocoa crop just started this week and goes to March for the Ivory Coast. That region is really the main thing impacting the share price, and it was as Charlie would call a lalapalooza effect, or combination of various short term factors that drove just how bad the 2324 main crop was. These factors have already begun to unwind, and Im assuming by next years main crop the speculation still present in cocoa commodities may be pushed out. Havent seen cocoa prices eclipse their stock and suppress it since the last go from roughly 20072013. Would have been 6 years of solid buying opportunities. Imagine that, a 6year Black Friday sale on solid businesses. You just dont get opportunities like that. And Hershey is more equipped today to deal with rising cocoa inputs than back then, or even back to the cocoa crisis of 1977.

Reddit,2024-09-26,"I have 138 shares in the 181182 range. Hard to say regarding downside I think 185 is a fair price. Would prefer lower than 180, but theres no telling where the price could go depending on the markets temperament and whats going on. While the Cocoa situation seems to be improving, and the CEO recently said they wont have any impact in 2024, there is impact expected in 2025 performance, should Cocoa remain elevated, which is likely. Itll probably take 2 normal or mediocre back to back harvests to offset the awful 2324 harvest. Anything next to that main crop looks good in contrast. So there is potential for the price to fall in the short term, it may, and it may not. But in either case I think its fairly priced right now.

Reddit,2024-09-25,"How about AR mapping overlaid directly on your vision for traffic directions. Like the AR on Google maps but no need to hold your phone up. 95 of my driving is between my workplace, my home, my familys homes, and stores I like.

Boeing cannot produce 737s while the workers are on strike, which means Boeing isnt getting their 100M cash deposit per day.

This 150M in lost revenue cash is what is causing the multitude of cost cutting measures such as furlough.

Reddit,2024-09-25,"Couple of things really stood out to me in this article. IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a very strong position, Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a reputational level too. Im absolutely on the side of the workersunion here. However, I suspect that Boeing doesnt really care about their reputation here as much as people think, or the public support behind the union. They have a near monopoly in their business, at least in terms of output capacity which is desperately needed in a critical field. It feels like poison saying it but that affords them the privilege to ignore reputation damage for a long time. Theres no where else for buyers to go, they have to deal with Boeing, trashed reputation or not. However this strike ends I suspect Boeing will push to move 737 production out of the PNW into areas like Atlanta and SC where unions arent as protected. Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October. This is going to be the downfall of Boeing that leads to some sort of inevitable government bailout. Shareholder primacy and value extraction mindset has been taken further and further over the cliff the last 50 years. Even with all of the recent revelations about the company, shareholders DEMAND the next quarter earnings be turned around. Its clear to anyone whos ever worked in any type of operations role that Boeing needs a solid 510 year turn around cycle to get it back on track, break even sure but put aside profits. Shareholders wont allow a reinvestment into the company.

Reddit,2024-09-25,"This short timeline shows that there are issues accross the board in multiple part of the whole manufacturing process. There are a LOT of whistleblowers that talk about unsafe manufacturing process or directives. The amount of issues seen in the last few years with Boeing planes all points to systemic failure in the manufacturing and quality control of planes. The fact that you try to somehow convince me that it is not Boeings fault but their suppliers or subcontracting entities fault is laughable. Even if it was, it is absolutely Boeings fault that they let the work of suppliers and subcontractors be the cause of so many issues by not applying proper quality control and mamufacturing reviews. This all point to systematic cost cutting in QC and Boeings own manufacturing capabilities that heavily inpacted Boeings ability to identify and solve issues before they cause accidents. Cheaper isnt always better, especially when you are talking about planes.

After all that, rather than ever ponder the possibility that she could be wrong, she continually makes excuses compared the market to the great depression when it was at all time highs, talked up all of her losses as a positive in a nowdeleted tweet, etc., chases events buying things into earnings lately, trying to get a quick boost and instead getting obliterated more than once and does other bullshit 1,600 target on ZM in 2026 only to sell it at 67, the bizarre whale oil comparison from 2021, etc. She never changes, never admits shes wrong, incessantly went on CNBC and talked about how her stocks were a good opportunity like a broken record all the way down in 2022 and instead of changing and showing any flexibility whatsoever, she tries to promote her massive losses to shareholders as something they should be happy about. Morningstar noted shed destroyed more wealth than any other fund family in the last decade and the fact that after that and everything else she hasnt changed at all is remarkable. Anything she owns is only great and any concerns are handwaived away. This doesnt even get into the multiple times she made future return predictions for the Ark funds on CNBC, which ARKK is nowhere close to at this point. Ever since covid, it feels like investing discussions online have gotten worse, people more frequently blame losses on various other things shorts, hedge funds, conspiracies, market makers, whatever rather than changing. Also, seems like more and more online discussion is just people talking their book theres not the balanced discussions there was on here years ago and anyone who isnt similarly bullish on something is regarded as wildly bearish when so many times they just are disinteresteddont caremaybe had minor questionsconcerns.

The modern Fed has enormous number of tools, facilities to influence the entire yield curve that they simply never had until just recently. They already have bought and hold more 10Ys than when even QT started. If Fed wanted, in theory they could do what Japan does and completely dominate the entire market. With so many levers like BTFP, discount window collateral requirements, they can inject liquidity at will, whenever they want to and immediately if necessary. Moreover, since IORB became a tool to set the floor on shortterm interest rates rather than buying commercial paper super short bonds, there also is no concern that Fed needs to cut to follow the market down either. All in all the only thing hes really right about is that Fed doesnt have special access to data that no one else has. Actually private participants often have more. Especially industry specific data. Therefore, if they cut that doesnt mean they see a collapse in the data we cannot. It just reflects their level of caution and desire to get it right.",Neutral,0,0.5041590929031372,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-23,"One of the few times his take didnt make sense to me. His point was that the Fed doesnt actually impact stocksinterest rates, because when they raise rates, there is little reaction in rates in the 36 months following. But it ignores the fact that rates across the economy react well in advance of the actual rate cut the impact of forward guidance. The 10 year treasury is a full percent lower than its peak and that was true even before the recent cut. If everyone is telling you months in advance the Fed is about to cut rates, why wouldnt you take this into account when offering loans? A more accurate take, though, is that the Fed isnt actually controlling rates, but rather following the rates. If the neutral rate goes up, everything goes up and so does the Fed rate, and viceversa. If they dont move with the neutral rate, economy either overheats or falls apart. And there are also big leverage FX markets stuff.

Theres probably something going on that is causing more depression and and of you fix that non medical cause, you eliminate the need for later medical intervention in the future. Same with health. If you dont let people get obese in the first place, its much easier to stay thin. So if we changed our food and activity inputs, it would eliminate the need for later medical treatment.

Reddit,2024-10-27,"Mandatory I am not a financial advisor. In your position, I would split my extra money between index funds and reinvesting in your own business. Of course your first priority should be becoming debtfree. Pretty silly to invest in something with a 10 ROI when youre still paying on a credit card with 15 interest. Same goes for the business, if it has debt. If you have a mortgage on your business building, paying that down will increase your equity and save you interest costs long term. Obviously check with your accountant as to the tax implications. Index funds do indeed let you invest in the whole market. The market as a whole has its ups and downs sometimes big ones but long term youre looking at around 10 average gains before inflation. Inflation adjusted average ROI is around 7. 25 years is definitely looking long term. As to your business Imagine for a minute that its not your business. Now imagine that youre a newly minted MBA who just got hired to manage the business. What changesinvestments are you going to suggest to the Csuite folks? The nice part here is, as you are going to be investing your own money, youre not going to be leveraged on those investments. So if a particular investment doesnt work out, you wont be getting any upsetting phone calls from the bank manager. Lastly, my Granddad taught me this There are two kinds of bosses. Imagine youre pushing a wheelbarrow. The first kind is walking behind you cracking a whip and screaming at you to move faster. The second kind is out ahead of you, opening gates and throwing planks across ditches. Make sure your business only has the second kind of bosses. People dont quit jobs they quit managers. And when employees quit, its always the best that leave the deadwood stays. Good luck with both your business and your investing.",Neutral,0,0.9997788071632385,Reply

Other assets should be included, such as smallercap US stocks, international stocks, bonds. Investing can be simple, but its not as simple as buying one fund suggested by SGOTI. has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals. Bogleheads is named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard. I retired at 57 years old. Investing doesnt have to be complicated or costly to be successful simple inexpensive is most effective. I invest 100 in totalmarket, indexbased, lowcost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguards Total Stock Market, Total Bond Market, Total International Stock Market, Total International Bond Market funds. Ive been investing this way for 35 years. Its effective, simple, inexpensive. My asset allocation ratios of the funds mentioned is based on my need, ability, willingness to take risks. Market conditions are not a factor. Vanguards investor questionnaire personal.vanguard.comusFundsInvQuestionnaire helps me determine my asset allocation. Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary uncompensated risk I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 510 of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publiclytraded company in the world thats interesting enough for me. All of the individual stocks sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. Im a member of the Triple Nine Society, but Im not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I dont. I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well. The differences are usually trivial for a longterm investor, especially if theyre the Vanguard funds I mentioned above. Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares ETF shares they both represent a piece of the same fund. The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds these are excellent choices for many investors. Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically. Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors. Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because theyve been the leader in this type of investing for decades because Vanguards customers are also Vanguards owners. I hope that helps!

Reddit,2024-10-27,"I would invest the money for two purposes. Invest for passive income, and build a savings for emergency cash needs. The passive income is to provide enough money to cover all of your living expenses Food, Clothing, housing, utilities, Medical insurance, and taxes. . That means investing in stock and bonds for a steady stream of income. That way if the buisness has a couple of bad years you still have money for living expenses . Eventually you could be able to separate your finances from the companies expenses . You will pay taxes on the dividend income I use These ETFs for this purpose. SCHD, VYMI, Pffd, FAGIX, JEPQ, and PBDC. Split money equally between these funds. And build up the amount until it reaches your passive income goal. For savings buy growth stocks that dont pay a dividend. These will not generate any tex until you sell them. You could also invest in ETFs that pay a minimal dividend like SCHG. A growth fund that has a di ivdend of 0.5. I you are ok with slightly higher dividend you could add some low cost index fund, like BVOO or VTI. This way you could eventually have several years worth of income saved up in low tax invesmts. Additionally you could have 12 a year of cash on hand that could ba accessed in a day or less with a debit card. This money could be used to rebuild the business should it be destroyed by fire or some sort of natural disaster. Eventually you could set up a second account for your buisness.

Its a greater than 80 probability they work out this way and its reflected in the options pricing. For the people here its simply that I see time and again a perplexing question by people of earnings were good but why did the price go down? And every time its very obviously written in what the betting was before earnings. For instance the price was rising into earnings and then drops suddenly on good earnings. All it means is that everyone lost and the price probably is landing at a break even between long and short bets on the earnings. Its very hard to make money on a short consistently. So usually a down move is to a break even point where shorts made no money and longs get wiped out. Longs who hold do inevitably make SOME return eventually so they tend to get punished more. Their own behavior causes this since most longs tend to increase cost basis routinely keeping it close to the 20 day moving average.,Neutral,0,0.9009032845497131,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-24,"Lets tear this apart a bit. Can you even define risk? How can you define a thing but not actually really know what it is. For instance is there systemic risk in owning one stock? Yes or no? The actual answer is no theres no such risk whatsoever owning an individual stock. Another example question. Is being 5x leveraged 5x more risky than being 1x leveraged? The answer is surprisingly, no. In fact through the use of options we can cater risk such that we take on large amounts of risk example 5x with much less risk than a cash investor. The trick here, why its confusing, is because the word risk doesnt actually mean anything. Theres other words used by professionals to explain these concepts and explain whats happening. All of it is investing. Youre paid to take risk. If you arent buying risk youre not getting paid, its as simple as that. No one is going to pay you money for free. And this has been a lesson in why theres a lot more to it, and why Investing is the same as gambling. Its the acquisition of risk and managing that risk. Since we cant control an outcome and the market is arguably random, proven by the fact that all options at the money are priced at 5050 outcomes random walk theory the only thing we can control is how to manage risk.

Reddit,2024-10-24,"I packed a ton of concepts in my other post but I also wanted to touch on derivatives. Derivative trading has been around since the 1600s. If you include discounted bills from banks then it goes back to the 1100s. So what exactly do you think has changed because of derivatives? Are you saying there was a time that investment was more pure and less risky? Derivatives are an instrument to trade risk. Examples If I buy a stock at price 100 but I cannot tolerate a price of 95 due to financing, I will sell my risk by buying a put. I want you to drill that into your head. SELL risk by BUYING a put. A person BUYS risk by SELLING a put. These derivative transactions allow a controller in a company shareholder to offload risk without losing control of their company. They can insure their risk to an insurer the same way a driver of a car insures their driving, or a homeowner insures their house. Buying a call ALSO sells your risk to a counterparty who is insuring your position. This is why most retail who buy calls to be bullish actually lose big, and where I diverge completely from the Options Council in their advice. They the options council is completely backward in explaining their own product. The reason they are backward is that on paper the math suggests that you take on risk by buying a call, because you own rights to buy shares. But the problem is they are backward in their thinking, as stated previously you are PAID TO TAKE RISK. You cant say that you reduce risk by buying puts and then say you add risk by buying a call. I can demonstrate this fact. A synthetic long is a long call AND a short put. The short put is BUYING risk youre paid to take on risk. So what is the long call? If it were also buying risk then the risk profile would be magnified infinitely with infinite downside potential. So a longcall MUST also be a hedge sells risk and it in fact is selling risk. Selling a call is buying risk that means the majority of longcall traders are shortsellers who need to hedge their downside the higher price action.",Neutral,0,0.9913161993026733,Reply

It LEVERAGES the trade because you can get a bigger overall return that is to say it is scalar. But, it reduces the return on capital. Youll never have a more advantageous time to buy than at 100.

Reddit,2024-10-24,"An example the one I was referring to was the current volatility carry trade. Called The Great Carry Trade. Look up Its really a shame Im butchering my explanations so much because everyone here must think Im a clown but Im right about what I say. Its just hard to explain easily. Anyway currently and has been true for about 15 years now The Great Carry Trade has generated about a 12 guaranteed return. And the scale of the downsides means you can basically put a 3x leverage on that. Guaranteeing a 36 return annum at scale. Its, broadly speaking a calendar spread suppressing volatility. You can see it generally play out in SVIX. Because VIX spiked to 40 in Aug4 you can see that SVIX has not returned as much as it should have since VIX fell back to 18. This is because the Great Carry Trade that defines our age is suppressing volatility. The SVIX did not pull back as much as it should have short volatility when volatility spiked. A way of thinking about that is digging a tunnel through a mountain to the other side. Price is at one elevation on the west side of the mountain and you tunnel through to the same price on the east side of the mountain. This matters because for someone who could lose everything at the mountain peak now they lose nothing. As a result youre seeing the effects of the Great Carry Trade in real time play out in SVIX. Its just an example. How do you unlock this trade? Easier said than done for retail. Banks are doing it over the counter with contracts that start at 1.5billion per contract. If I can dig up an example of that I would I had one before. The reason isnt so straight forward. Its not an ETF you buy into because markets dont work that way. The banks are offsetting losses DUE to volatility by suppressing volatility rolling it out in theory in perpetuity. The conclusion of the book is that if the volatility suppression were to ever break down wed have some real financial problems on our hands. But for now, thats not an issue. Until then, its the 1920s. Make money while you can. By 1929 put it in gold or cigarettes. Something that everyone will need when the smoke evaporates.",Neutral,0,0.9953898191452026,Reply

However, your concerns about debt and economic stability are valid. While the current economic indicators look great on the surface, the underlying issues with rising debt levels and potential inflation could definitely create vulnerabilities. The 1920s saw a lot of speculation and overleverage, which ultimately contributed to the crash. It makes you wonder if were enjoying a temporary high without addressing the foundational issues that could lead to a downturn.

Reddit,2024-10-21,"One thing I would say is, you have to be willing to compare the anecdotal and the metric. Why? Because metrics are just proxies for the things they are measuring while anecdotes are things typically made through an ontheground point of view. Its why the FED is saying that the economy is doing fine, that job growth is up, and inflation is down. While on the flip side, many people in the economy feel the exact opposite. If that was the case then why did the FED choose to cut rates at the time that they did, if job growth and the economy is doing fine? Inflation isnt below 2 like Powell wanted and yet they still decided to cut rates. That means there is something in the data that suggested that they needed to act fast to get ahead of whatever they anticipate to happen. Also dont forget, whenever the FED does such massive rates cuts, a recession is typically declared 1218 months after the fact. History doesnt act out the same way but history does rhyme, and I just feel that most people tend to stick their head in the sand because thinking that there may be an economic downturn in the future is scary to them.",Neutral,0,0.9874467253684998,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-21,"Well your partially correct, the fed was created to help stabilize banks. But that was 1913 iirc. The thing that happened during the Great Depression is people heard banks were insolvency, so they rushed to get money out, which caused the banks to fail and peoples bank accounts to go to zero. Then people obviously distrusted banks and didnt put money in hem, which made the velocity of money low and hurt the economy. The fix to the problem of bank runs was federally insured accounts even if your bank goes under, the Feds will cover your balance, so theres no need to withdraw your money or distrust the banks. The issue with that is that it with bailouts removed the banks incentive to make safe investments. But thats a different issue",Negative,-1,0.9999297857284546,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-21,"The crash of 1929 happened because the major banks all got together and recalled those margin loans on the same day, forcing many people to sell stock in a futile attempt to repay their loans to people like JP Morgan. The bank owners then swooped in as the market crashed and bought those same stock at bargain basement prices, knowing they could afford to hold the stock until the markets recovered. Therefore making millions while all the small investors lost their shirts. I have no idea where you got this nonsense from. The bankers buying was an attempt to stop the slide, which had been done successfully multiple times over the previous 2 decades and was essentially expected of them to try to restore confidence in the market. They didnt buy the bottom they were attempting to catch a falling knife on behalf of the markets. The main guy doing so bankrupted himself and his businessamong others. In addition, the margin calls didnt trigger the crash The margin calls were contractual and entirely based on the prices falling and traders who were trading on margin. The markets were clearly shaky and overextended more than a month prior, with some famous economists predicting it and advising investors sell and get out. Finally, even if you found some evidence that what you described was the intent, these bank owners did not make millions, many of them went bankrupt None of them turned a profit from the crash.

The timeframe is longer than most people would like. Stocks beat bonds in every 30 year period. The best period for bonds loses to the worst 40 year period for stocks. As your timeframe gets shorter however the results get more mixed. At least in the USA 15 year periods of low returns almost always are followed by 15 year periods of high returns. So while you can have bad 15 year periods you dont bet multiple ones. But the situation is a lot more volatile than one would like. Which is why diversification matters so much. The SP500cap weighted USA total stock market isnt a great diversifier. Worse the sector diversification of the USA again cap weighted is worse than it has been in a very long time which means the above assurances about 15 year periods anticorrelating may not be true going forward.",Negative,-1,0.6028639078140259,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-21,"Good question. What Id say is that the amount being dumped into AI is substantial. A single Nvidia GB200 rack is around 3MM. A data center intended to support AI is billions. The impact of this will depend upon the size of the company in question. For a small startup its obvious, the CapEx is substantial and any deviation in revenue is crippling. For the Mag 7Hyperscalers, the CapEx isnt as big of a deal since they all sit on enormous piles of cash. However, a substantial portion of their increased value over the last 2 years is heavily attributed to AI. It would stand to reason that they may have to give back some of that value if the projected revenue associated with AI doesnt come to fruition. Similarly, there will be ripples as a result of this. There are a number of Tier 1sTier 2s that are all in in supporting AI. There are dedicated hardware solutions in cabling, cooling, rack systems, etc. These systems are only necessary for 50kW racks which really only AI and HPC require.

If you pay the 10k towards the 100k instead, at 47 months the balance is 81,870. And you would have 12,174.still on the 7 year loan left. Add them together and you get the 94153. The reason it shows up as being better after 30 years, is that you stopped paying the full monthly on the 7 years, which is potentially good, but then the interest kicks in and you arent paying all the loans off at the same monthly anymore.",Neutral,0,0.9999241828918457,Reply
Reddit,2024-10-18,The way I view it is that it matters when you pay a loan off. 10k on principle at the beginning of the loan when most of what your paying is just covering interest is going to have a bigger impact than closer to when the loan is ending. At the end most of it just goes towards principle so its not saving much on the interest side Edit I could be wrong but I think the math sides with me. Specifically paying off the house first With a 30 loan the savings on interest are way higher for a single payment,Neutral,0,0.9956653714179993,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-17,"Yes good question. The slope of the 200wma has been fairly consistent since 2012 and if you project it into the future, in 2027 it would be at about the levels its at today. But, at that point it will have been 5 years since it has been tested which is not the general trend it follows over the past decade. Now if that does happen and we keep trending up like the past 100 weeks, it would increase the slope of the 200wma slightly, but not by a lot. Since 2012 there are slight oscillations above and below a general slope of the 200wma. Since the 200wma is a longer time frame it doesnt change slope too much unless you have big events like 20082012 that drastically change the charts character over the span of years. Events that are only months long like COVID dont change it too much, and even the longer draw down of 2022 had significant weekly bounces to keep the general trend valid, and in that instance you can see a touch of the 200wma is what marked the bottom",Neutral,0,0.9997676014900208,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-17,"Not a bad question. Let me break it down. Basically, the issue here that makes it difficult to make sense of comparing charts like SPY vs SPMO is that you have to adjust things by their vol. If SPMO makes more, but _only_ because its more risky, then youre not actually getting a free lunch here. Youre receiving more reward for taking more risk, but the payback will be as excessively painful as the rewards. Youre probably familiar with this concept from comparing QQQ vs SPY. We all pretty much know and agree QQQ does better for awhile bc its more volatile, but when the downturn comes, it gets smacked twice or thrice as hard. If you wanted to backtest this yourself, youd want to calculate daily returns from spy and spmo. Youd also calculate their stdev aka volatility. Then youd look at the return series return_spmovol_spmoreturn_spyvol_spy, which effectively emulates the trading strategy of going long spmo and hedging with a vol equivalent sized spy position. I tested something like this just now, i wanted to know and it has a sharpe ratio of .26, which is pretty trash, definitely not of statistical significance. If spmo was actually better than spy on a risk adjusted basis, the sharpe should be higher, like at least 1.",Neutral,0,0.9731791615486145,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-17,"No you can never say with absolute certainty what will happen, you can only say what is probable to happen based on the established current trend. And the trend says that it tends to come close to 200wma every 24 years, and its been 2 years now since its been tested. For perspective most peaks are about 33 above the 200wma before regressing, but in early 2022 it was almost 50! above it before regressing to it later that year. Stocks go up...and they come down. Ok so the 200wma is my price target, but why does it happen? The other data that is useful to look at for clues as to how price can move is volume. Right now the market is dribbling up on bullish news but weak volume. More buyers than sellers, but not a ton of buying either, despite bullish news.

Reddit,2024-10-17,"Ok, so two points there. Theyre capping the account growth to 6 or less. but the cbp plan assets can be whatever it is. If the assets decline, your account is credited less.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"Bond compounding youve got the idea. Stock compounding we usually expect a company to reinvest the bulk of its earnings in order to generate return on investment. The value of a stock is typically determined by an expectation of the present value of future cash flows same as a bond, mechanically, but different rate of return. The future cash flows of a company will be increased if the reinvested earnings result in growth of profits. Recurrent growth on base plus growth is compounding. The compounding doesnt happen in credits to your account in the form of interest but increases in your share of the cash flow generation and growth of that stream. You collect the compounded cash when you sell your equity rights to someone else. ETF think of a buying an etf as buying shares in a company that just owns shares in other companies. An ETF compounding is just the sum of all of the individual companies held by the fund. When you buy the fund you buy property rights and the sum of those rights increase as the cash flow generation from the companies in the portfolio increase. Your problem here is not that you are misunderstanding compounding, but the problem is that your understanding of how different types of financial instruments work is incomplete. Think of value as cash flows and the financial instrument as the mechanism of financial claim and youll get closer, maybe.

Isnt the whole POINT of holding a significant percentage of bondsbond funds is that you sell those off while your equities are down thus preserving their value until the equity value returns?...For that matter if you sell your bonds during the downturn to rebalance you can even come out ahead when the market recovers since you bought equities at a discount. I dont agree that thats the point of bonds. The benefit you get from rebalancing is smaller than the difference in expected returns between stocks and bonds. So over the long term youd come out ahead if you were 100 equities with no bonds. The real point of holding bonds is to reduce overall volatility to a degree that allows you to live through a downturn without freaking out. this last bump a couple years ago some bond funds did go down in value. But not nearly as much as equities. You must not be aware of ZROZ or EDV. They definitely lost more than equities in 22. Bonds funds can have a wide range of risk from nearly zero to nearly as volatile as stock funds. Just be careful and dont assume all bond funds are like SHY or BND.

The ratings agencies downgrade all those corporate bonds and the value of your bonds declines markedly just as your stocks are going down leaving you with no capital to inject into your equity portfolio and to be able to buy at low prices. Warren Buffett gets around this problem by having 285 billion in Treasury bills which dont go down in value as they are short duration of only four to 13 weeks.

Now the surplus of males causes high competition for the available females. This causes the price of marriage to go up because now parents are looking at the wealth their daughter will get. Why approve of a marriage to a poor guy who only has two houses when we can approve of a rich guy with 4 houses? The was one cause of the housing market always seeming to continuing to raise.

They are also failing to contribute to the economy which is a problem. 5 One way they were stimulating the economy was through infrastructure spending. Think of building massive cities for no one to live in or massive highways to places that dont have enough population to justify them, etc. 6 Falling tax base this one is based on the back of the falling real estate market. Since they dont have property tax how do the municipal governments get money? In the past they got money through sellingleasing land to the large builders. The same ones going bankrupt now. So now the large builders are no longer buying and the governments have a greatly diminished tax base. 7 They are attempting to use dept trap diplomacy which hasnt been a problem when their economy was doing well but now that its cooling off all of that extra cash could sure be useful. 8 Western companies pulling out and diversifying supply chains.

I ask because I earlyretired 8 years ago starting with a 65 stake in bonds, but that extreme was necessary to bring volatility downbecause we spend the portfolio down about 3 annually for all our living expenses. If you anticipate spending down just a small fraction of your pie for living expenses, then in your shoes Id still aim for growth, yet guard against possibly unrecoverable huge drawdowns by using an asset like Treasurys that rallys when stocks tank. For example a 15 stake in longishterm Treasurys will balloon into a 20 to 23 stake in a big stock selloff. In a selloff youre already in a better position than people with 100 stock portfolios. In this example youd only have an 85 exposure to stocks. Then for a bonus, you can sell off however much of the bond position you want in order to buy more stocks at depressed prices. And because of this, when stocks recover, youll reach breakeven quicker than someone with a 100 stock portfolio.

I guess dealing with the possibility of losing any money when you have spent so many years accumulating it is really disconcerting.

Reddit,2024-10-10,"DCA is about emotional management, not long term results. As soon as someone communicates any weakness in financial matters the whole conversation is shifted away from what is optimal and correct towards what minimizes their chances of making a significant mistake. For example, pulling all your money out of the market is a big mistake. So while its completely correct to put the money in right away, doing so then having a drop might trigger the scenario where they pull it out again. So its DCA in order to manage those emotions if it goes up they have a benefit, if it goes down then they successfully timed it and have a benefit from that. The best thing a person can do as an investor is to fix themself first, preferably before they get money. Then you can run everything optimally. For example if I talk to an advisor and I say I put my money in the sp 500 index fund or VTI market for the past 20 years and Ive only sold some to buy a car and do a bathroom remodel then that person knows that Ive been through multiple significant downturns and never touched it.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"My advice is to invest in an ETF that pays a dividend. In my accoun I have FAAGIX 5 yield in gov and corporate bonds. PFFD 6, Coperagte divides payed out monthly. And I am considering BIZD or PBDC both have a yield of about 10 operate dividends. If investing in an ETF you will pay taxes on the dividends but If you keep the yield at about 5 the tax is going to similar to the tax on your HYSA right now. At a 10 yield would add about another 5000 to yourtaxes. This will not likely have a major impact on your taxes. The biggest risk fro investing in EFTs like this Occurs when you have to sell share if you need more than the yearly dividend. But the share price only varies by about 5 from it average or less. So if you timing is bad you probably wont loose a lot.. The only other risk is loss of dividends. These ETF invest in many companies so if only one goes Bad it isnt going to have a noticeable impact. Most of the time there is just a slow change in dividend pay out over time. The most challenging year for all of these dividends 2as 2020 due to the pandemic. All continued to pay the dividend. you could invest the entire 100K into these funds in Fidelity or Schwab account and then have the dividend About 5,000 to 10000 go into a cash account that would earn an interest of about 4 O you can leave much of the money as cash earning about the same as a HYSA with l a lesser amount in the ETFs, you could keep the dividends as cash or reinvest them in the ETF to increase the dividend. Since you are expected college expenses for thee next few yours this is probably thee best option for now. However after that you could continue the dividend income to refill the cash and reinvest dividends to grow the dividend.s build the dividend to help cover you in the event of a job loss If you build the dividnend yearly income you could get 24000 a year social security level. or more. possibly enough to over all or most of your living expenses.

For your kids the best thing for school would have been 529 plans. Not a HYSA. Could have saved a ton on taxes and even invested in whatever you wanted to maximize returns. Also, the actual best thing to do is to male sure they are prepped for the SATACT and apply for grants and scholarships.

Also, go to an in decent in state school 98 of the time over paying double to go to nonivy league level school and paying double for little to no extra benefit to make it even worth it. 3.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"Hi uBytchYouThought, I have seen several of your comments on other posts and appreciate your view point. You comments here are pretty close to what my goal has been, though I have probably gone about it slightly different. The comments to this post has also proven to be very helpful and educational. In many ways, providing the exactly the information I was hoping to learn. Anyway... I will at least respond to your points below 1. That was exactly my thought. I dont like debt, but quickly realized I could easily earn more with the I would put on the mortgage then I would save by reducing interest. That is when I started setting aside extra income. This was about 4 years ago. God has bless us with the ability to double my income single income home and have some extra unexpected bonuses. This is where 120K of the 150 came from, we already had the emergency fund. 2. There is a reason I didnt invest in 529 plans for the kids. For most of our lives we didnt have extra to put in them. As a single family home with five kids, we have had to be frugal to get where we are. My plan was to increase my income to help directly bank role education at least help when the kids were college age. So far that has worked. Give my sons grades and test scores he will have significant scholarships, I am hoping to only need to split 1520K a year with him. We are looking at private christian university LeTourneau due to the quality of education and campus environment. It also aligns with our values. It is more expensive than a local state school, but we believe it is worth it. 3. I have certainly seen people freak out over HYSA rates. That isnt what I am doing. I dont even go chase rates as I know they fluctuate often. I now have saving to cover the remainder of our mortgage and was hoping there were ways to keep it earning a little more than a savings account. In other words, as a relative novice, I was assuming there are better options that I didnt know about... and I have learned about a lot of them in this thread... such as tax advantaged VUSXX or SGOV. With this knowledge I will likely move into a brokerage account where I can keep the same or slightly better yield with state tax savings and an easy path to slowly move into longer term investments such as VTI as I am able to add cash. 3.5 To your point of over blowing the risk of the market... I try not to. I actually usually set at a higher risk posture since I recognize the market goes down and back up again. To your point of being well off... I am blessed. Much of this blessing has been realized in the last five years or so. I am also disciplined. My 401K just passed 1M this year, so yes... I am well on my way to a happy retirement. I realized I didnt know as much about managing and investing in a taxable account, which I would like to learn now that I have... and Lord willing will continue to have... increased expendable income. So, that was more of a book than I planned. In short, I am trying to do exactly what you are recommending... not getting over focused on HYSA or fearful of the market so I can move extra savings that I have into a slightly higher risk position to earn more prior to potentially needing to pull from it to help my kids with schooling or use it in an emergency to cover our mortgage. To that end, this has been VERY helpful! Thank you!",Neutral,0,0.8109925389289856,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-08,"Seems like you have a big enough fund that you could potentially do a rolling CD plan. Invest X every X months on a rolling basis.

After a while, depending on the length of the CD, you will always have that 1 maturing monthly to maintain some liquidity. The drawback being if you have a bad emergency, you will have to wait for the next chunk to mature before you can use the funds, but if you do 6 month CDs, its not terrible, but it is essentially risk free since theyre FDIC insured and all. I do it with 6 months, so at least if I have an emergency that depletes my emergency fund, I can just use credit to pay for it temporarily until the CD matures to pay it off.

Reddit,2024-10-08,"Ah, perhaps I should clarify a few things. The first, this is just one persons opinion and when it comes to personal finances you can feel free to say hey ubytchyouthought, yours stinks and I wouldnt lose a wink of sleep and completely understand. Two, I rushed that comment as evident by typos and what not. Also 1. Yeah, I dont really care for debt either, but 2.8 is 2.8 and I personally just let the math overrule my feelings. Some folks are more comfortable even if it was 2.8 the fact that it had debt attached many folks would still want to prioritize paying it off anyway, because its the fact that it is debt at all and not about math. So, you have to make the decision whether math or the feeling is more important to you. You know my choice. 2. I wasnt judging you for not doing 529s. Most people dont and in fact, most people would have a hard time paying for their kids school at all period. This is how my parents were. I ended up taking the honors classes and getting decent scores on ACT etc sports scholarship etc. Point is do what you can not a judgement or explanation needed as to why you didnt do something. If you can afford to move money there cool, but if not raising your kids well is worth way more and they understand and will figure it out either way. 3. Yeah, I mentioned treasury funds in my original comment which is exactly what SGOV and VUSSX is. Basically same rates overall as hysas just marginally higher to the point of being Basically around the same. I have part of my savings in USFR, but honestly moved it anyway to a hysa at 5.0 since having instant access is just nice and the difference doesnt matter much at all to me. 3.5 Naw, I understand the pressure of getting scared by the market. I just realize its way scarier to not have enough for retirement and not have retired early. The fact of the matter is, theres nothing to be scared of, because the moment the market doesnt recover is the moment your money is worthless anyway and you should more focused surviving a literal apocalypse no exaggeration rather worrying about worthless money. So in other words, its either you make out ahead or youre basically dead or enslaved anyway. Oh, looks like youre on the road to FIRE as well. Congrats! Yeah, for me, my emergency fund a years worth of expenses basically covers me so I dont worry about my long term money. If you want you could pay off the house.

Reddit,2024-10-05,"Its a nice thought experiment, but youre taking it too far in your conclusions. Assumptions like management will always spend money in good faith to maximize earnings are useful if you want to make a world that is spreadsheetcompatible, but massively off the mark from the real world. In the real world management has incentives like getting the stock price to a certain number by a certain time to get a payout, future be damned. Creating unrealistic narratives about future earning to justify or increase PE ratios you know are excessive. Tech is a huge part of the SP500 and these problems are very common in tech. Around the dotcom crash this all got so bad that nobody could give out any dividends at all, for fear of demonstrating that they dont have endless golden geese lined up that the money would be better spent on. These days theyve gotten a little better about this and your Apple, Microsoft, and Google at least pay out a nominal dividend of like 0.51. Investors regularly get their money pissed up the wall like this in tech, when they would have been much better off just receiving it as a dividend than having tens of billions wasted on the metaverse with promises that all life would revolve around this concept in a few years, only to have them say actually never mind its all fake after a few years of stock options vesting at high valuations. Of course, were in the middle of a similar bubble with AI, so this all seems quaint now, but trust me, in a few years there will be a lot of people saying I wish they had just given me the money.

True you may not want a fast growing company to pay dividends and instead invest in growth. However, most companies dont fall into that category and would likely waste extremely large investments. I guess you could make an argument for stock buybacks since they are more tax efficient but because they are expected at regular intervals they dont quite have the same ability to discipline management.",Neutral,0,0.9981434345245361,Reply

During your accumulation phase you would be wrong to have any allocation other than a diversified portfolio that is spread between growth and value with some adjustment for whether we are in a Value or a Growth phase in the market. In the Early Accumulation phase you should be heavily invested in equities as you dont much care about down cycles as you have little money at risk. In the late accumulation phase you start to build in a strategy for up and down markets as you now have some principal to protect. In the Preretirement stage you start to worry more about beta and less about alpha particularly if you have done a good job of accumulation. In Retirement your goals are preservation and income, so less beta is more important than excess alpha unless you are late to the party. Assuming you have hit your goals, then joining rdividend and forgetting a growth allocation makes total sense.

With a bond they cannot exactly just cut the interest that would require a default, that means the company goes bankruipt . A company can cut or reduce the dividend at any time. So they are just much safer in general . Second bonds tend to rise in value when we hit a recession because usually in a recession the Federal reserve bank lowers interest rates, when rates go lower bond prices rise So in a recession stocks tend to go down, but bond holdings tend to appreciate helping offset your stock losses Dividend stocks tend to fall with the market, they may not fall as much but they still are highly correlated with the market , in the covid crash SCHD fell 31 in a month , VOO fell about 32 so you can see its not even that much safer In the initial panic BND bond fund only fell like 4",Neutral,0,0.8288984894752502,Reply

The primary reason being is a company will trade at some much higher multiple say 7 to 20 times depending on business so if youre only lent 3 to 4, you are safely inside a potential EV of the company. Secondarily, the lender wants to ensure you generate enough cash flow to cover the interest expense of the debt.

Reddit,2024-09-29,"Emergency fund is commonly used in reference to money designated for life emergencies. Investable cash, kept as cash, is usually referred to as a cash position or similar language in order to express that its separate from the emergency fund. Mathematically, cash positions are less effective than being fully invested, when the specific goal is maximizing returns. Time in the market beats timing the market is a popular mantra relating to that. However, some strategies use cash or uncorrelated assets alongside equities in order to rebalance or otherwise store gains or prepare for quick deployment of capital as opportunities arise. Personally, Im fully invested at all times. My taxable account is entirely buy and hold, broad market index funds. My 401k is in a target date fund. My IRA is where I use more active strategy. I hold 40 SSO 2x daily SP 500 leveraged ETF at all times, with the other 60 defaulting to VOO. When great swing trade opportunities pop up, or as allocation drift occurs, I move capital from the VOO side. This keeps me at 100 or more exposure to the SP 500 at all times, while allowing me a mechanism to also address opportunity.

Reddit,2024-09-29,"I dont suggest most people do what I am doing. Credit and credit cards are a tool. If you are young and still establishing yourself, its best to avoid any shenanigans and focus on your career.. once you are established and buy your forever home and just finishing buying a new car and have enough in savings and investments to buy a new car outright if you really needed to... thats when its time to ask if there are other ways to use your tools than how they were originally intended.. until then, play it straight and avoid trouble. Many people also have trouble with credit and self control in the same way alcoholics have trouble with alcohol, so I generally dont recommend people use credit cards to begin with unless they are naturally frugal. That said, I think you drastically overestimate the long term effect of opening multiple credit cards. See the wiki at rchurning for more information... but having opened and closed over 70 credit cards over the last 15 years, my wifes credit score is above 800, and my credit score with 5 maxed out credit cards and another dozen with no balance is still above 740... again, this happens once you have a long history of responsible credit use across dozens of different credit accounts among different loan types... if your 22 and have only ever had 2 credit cards and a student loan, opening a bunch of them will crash your score... for 612 months unless you carry a balance. After 612 months, if you used them responsibly and didnt carry a bunch of debt, you will find your credit score is higher than it was when you opened them.

Of course, maybe you can convince yourself that the level of research and analysis youve done for each company is sufficient. But I think thatd be a tad bit naive. The amount of analysis is always going to be infinite, and unless you have your own bulletproof definition of what constitutes a good company, Id argue that you may as well just buy more index funds and save yourself the hours of research.

Also bear in mind that price discovery is achieved by volume of trades, not assets under management. 99 of assets held passively while the remaining 1 are traded around at high frequency discovers price just as well as 5050 with lower frequency.

Over 18 years it turned into quite a bit of money.. would you need to understand is most stock brokers money managers recommend it because its a load fund with a five and a quarter up front fee which is pretty heavy relative to everything else nowadays and even if you sign whats called rights of accumulation where you commit to investing a certain amount to lower your breakpoint of your upfront fees its still a lot.. you can go to vanguard and get an SP index fund or one of the vanguard longterm growth funds and their returns are going to be relatively similar because theyre going to only seen type of companies theres a great deal of overlap you may have more coke in one and more Pepsi in another and more McDonalds and one more Walmart in another but youre going to have a great deal of overlap.. would you have to understand is if youre going to an investment broker or a cfp youre going there for a reason because you need advice and if you go there and you choose not to use them thats fine but if you go there and you keep picking their brain but you never invest with them its going to be a very short conversation at some point in time because thats what used to happen to me a long time ago. I meet with clients multiple times they come to the office understand my investment approach what Im looking for you understand what their financial needs are there Risk tolerances you qualify them you get everything done and you disclosed to them like this is what we would invest in ABCD this is the approach and they basically take your information and leave and go elsewhere is where they do it themselves.. thats the risk of the business but a lot of times they would come back later and go well this didnt work out well what didnt work out will this particular investment well we didnt do anything together so why are you asking me what the problem is because I had no knowledge that you were taking our conversation elsewhere is an investing.. I have friends this day that are cfps that are very good theyre honest they follow whats called The prudent mans rule they put the customer first the company second and there needs dont even get factored in the equation.. and within the industry theres a lot of slime balls.. you can have all of your needs taken care of from a longterm investment standpoint from vanguard or fidelity or similar the whole idea of putting it into a mutual fund is its actively managed and as times change the percentage of investments in different companies change. Or you can just go into an index fund whatever the market does it does and my suggestion to you would be to consistently dollar cost average in every single month and dont look at the principal because when the market goes up and you invest you buy less when the market goes down you buy more shares and 20 30 years down the road when it comes time for you to cash out youre going to have a lot of money.

Causing the market to tumble and bankscompanies on the brink of collapse. Were no where near this. Especially since our regulations are more full proof and banks stress test these potential scenarios much better.

Yes black swans can tank the market and the market can obviously be irrational as it likes to be from time to time, but everything tracks global liquidity full stop. And the current Global liquidity cycle is just now starting to ramp up. So prices are going a lot higher from here. The FED is way too high on interest rates still so those will be coming down a lot more by the end of next year. They also have to refinance trillions in debt and nobody wants to do that at a high interest rate. The money printer will be turned on in earnest soon enough. This is also an election year, they will juice the markets as much as needed to give the incumbent the edge. Simple thing to do is to remember we are in a Perpetual global debt cycle. This newly established fouryear cycle of raising rates, tightening, then cutting rates and pumping liquidity has been on loop since 2008. We are nowhere near the end of the party for this Mini cycle.

Reddit,2024-09-23,"What a ridiculous analysis. In the world of reality you adjust prices for equities to the same point in time if you want to compare them. All assets, including bonds and equities, need to be adjusted for inflation. Just because you dont know how much youre going to be able to sell your equities for in the future doesnt mean you dont need to adjust your returns on the stocks for inflation. There was a decade starting in the 70s where inflation averaged nearly 10yr. If equities had increased by 5 per year over the same period, you couldnt logically say equities are at an all time high, because they are actually worth less. You get more dollars but you can buy less total goods. To be totally accurate you should include dividends but its hard to find an SP500TR chart adjusted for inflation and Im too lazy to adjust the nominal chart. So like I said, I think it would be reasonable to sell stocks and purchase bonds if you are planning to spend the money in the next few years because the stock market could tank and not recover for decades. If you purchase TIPS, it will at least cover inflation, essentially locking in your gains todate with way less risk.

Reddit,2024-09-22,"Ive grown up running businesses with my parents, and have run several as an adult. If you were a friend coming to me with this question, here are a few things Id offer for you to consider and some are probably repeated from others in this thread. 1. If theres no urgency, take your time. Conversations with your spouse assuming its a good longterm relationship will perhaps be the most valuable and important part of the process. How does it impact your family life, goals, travel, etc.? Go out to dinner and kick around scenarios. 2. Write out the worstcase scenarios. What would you do if the business went bellyup? Sometimes its not as bad as you think. What would your exit plan or fixit plan be if the business started bleeding cash or losing customers? Again, another great conversation with your spouse. 3. Take time digging into the financials. If the owner gets defensive or protective, then thats a red flag. They should want to be transparent. 4. How much could you scale the company and how long would it take. For instance, Im hoping to double my business income and profit in the next 1218 months. If the company can only scale to a certain level, then Id figure that into my decision. Also, is it easy to scale without a lot of cash? Create a plan to scale the business and perhaps talk with the owner to get his thoughts. 5. Is your market easily disrupted, or does your business have a good moat protecting it? 6. Think through ways of lowering your risk. 125K might feel big, but acquiring a profitable company is not a huge investment assuming its truly profitable and growing. The bigger risks are the business risks, but they also have the biggest upside. Your investment might grow and could easily be replaced by your companys IRA over the next couple of years, back to lowering your risk. If youre uncomfortable investing the entire 125, you could work out a way to lower the sales price to 1 million or 750K, and do a profit share or something similar with the owner. Im not saying thats what you want to do, but its an option. It has its downsides. But for the owner, it could be a way for him to save on capital gains depending on how its structured. 7. Can you hire and fire? Its a small company, and it sounds like youll be the one doing thisor ultimately will need to make the call. Ive seen too many good small businesses languish because they drag things out. Either then dont hire to scale, or they allow toxic people to kill morale and productivity. If you cant do this, dont buy a business. 8. Get a mentor or coach from your industry. 9. Get an accountant and payroll person you LOVE LOVE LOVE working with and who is timely. This is one area where you want someone who is incredibly timely and topnotch competent. I hope that all helps. My final thought is that being a business owner, especially when its healthy, can be an amazing experience and really rewarding. Ive been doing it for over 35 years and done right, can give you a lot of freedom and the ability to provide great jobs to people you enjoy working with.",Neutral,0,0.9358901679515839,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-21,"UPDATE I wanted to provide an update since this is an investing sub and I owe it to you to provide transparency. I wasnt anticipating so much push back and negativity. Investing looks quite different to everyone DCA to large swing trades, and Im glad I trusted myself as it paid off significantly! I originally dipped my toe into LUNR back in September this year and sized in significantly shortly after once my thesis was confirmed that it was on a bullish uptrend. I scaled into position in layers, and averaged 8.70sh for a total of 32,272 shares. I took profit also scaling out of my position over the past two weeks making about 80 profit CDN, or about 225,000 on my position. I did find that this stock had too much volatility for me to stomach and it was hard on me mentally and physically. That being said, this stock helped my family and I cross the 1M net worth milestone including home equity, etc.. I am a swing trader and have studied the markets closely for the past 6 years. I feel that there are excellent opportunities in this market today that give you the ability to pull out the big bat and make a calculated swing! I realized my mental approach to investing was lazy and I wasnt taking an emphasized approach to great opportunities! Our next goal is to have a total of 1M in investment assets, and I am now switching my attention to ACHR 40,000 shares or 35 of my portfolio. I will be keeping an eye on LUNR into the new year and looking for opportunities to buy in.",Positive,1,0.9544776082038879,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-21,"Its hard to say without knowing what stock youre talking about. But buying after it went up 60 instead of selling is probably something I personally wouldnt do. Let alone going that much deeper into the position. Now it doesnt have to go down nearly as much for you to be in the hole. Ive been investing for a few years and consistently beating the market by a good margin for 2 years. I put a lot of money on one stock at a time, not all of my money though, never all of my money even when I have more conviction in a investment than Ive ever had. Because thats just overly risky for no good reason, anything could happen. When were talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars and more what becomes just as important as growth, if not more important, is capital preservation. Where I personally think youre going wrong is trying to get rich quick. The turtle always wins the race. A compounding 1 weekly can already get you rich rather quickly, without betting the whole house on one stock. Too much risk. I also tend to sell as soon as I see a noteworthy profit. I like to compare returns to a couple different baselines. On a single position Im in, which I only focus on one position at a time in my trading account long term port of etfs separately, I compare my returns to a bondmoney market fund. People hold bonds for a year to make 5 less now, if youve been holding a stock for a month and are up 5, youre making 5 in just a month instead of a year, in other words thats 12x the return of a bondmmf. If you can make that in a week, as stocks can certainly fluctuate enough to do, than thats 52x more than a bond will pay per year, and people happily take their 5 a year so if you dont take a 5 gain in a week its almost greedy imo. When you can take a modest compounding 2.55 gain per week thatll make you quite wealthy within a couple years time. Shooting for stars and not selling when its good enough to screenshot is how people get wrecked, Ive seen it happen many a time and it even happened to me in the beginning. The second baseline is an obvious one, the SP. I only compare that baseline with my overall portfolio performance.",Neutral,0,0.9992067217826843,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-19,"There is so much nuance here, and so many different types of bond funds. I assume youre talking about BND? A total bond index like BND would have a lot of corporate bonds in them, and corporate bonds are not the best diversifiers for stocks. The best bonds for that are treasury bonds. In late april we started getting economic data that indicated economic slowdown. Unemployment started rising, inflation cooling, etc and people started to flee to flight to safety assets. Every time we got bad news, the market tumbled and treaury bonds spiked upwards. Here is the data from May 1st to now. Look at how long treasury bonds EDV spike whenever the large cap index drops. BND slightly does this as well, since as a total bond index it holds some long treasuries and corpo bonds not many, but the rate sensitivity of BND is not very strong. Its a poorer diversifier. Ignore the cagr, its misleading due to the short time period In the long term, treasury bonds are negatively correlated to stocks, while corporate bonds are weakly correlated so theyre okay diversifiers but not great. The times that long bonds and stocks move up together is during bull runs where rates are steady and inflation is steady.",Negative,-1,0.9266700148582458,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-19,"I mean interest rates will affect both bonds and equities because changes in interest rates will affect the Present value of both, both bonds and equities have future cash flows that get discounted to a present value so changes in the discount rate affects both of them. Meaning I have a bond that matures in 20 years and I will get a lump sum payment of 10k. What is it worth today? We know 10k is 20 years is not worth 10k today , I mean no one would buy it for 10k to get zero returnunless we are in some weird deflationary environment . So we do some PV calculation that discounts it and we need to come up with a discount rate What do we use for this rate? I mean we could just use the current 5 rate but no one believes rates will be 5 for the next 20 years. So again we do some estimation guess and maybe we use 4.5 so using this rate its worth about 4,145.00 but now lets say new information comes out , and we change our estimate to 3.5 now that raised the PV to like 4,975.00 Well we can basically do a similar calculation to value companies , we make more estimation like what their future cash flows will be, but their future cash flows are still discounted . If we estimate a company to make 10 million dollars in year 20 , well that 10 million in year 20 is not with 10 million today , it gets discounted in a very similar fashion",Neutral,0,0.9999202489852905,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-19,while the funds track bonds mostly Bond funds track the bonds they hold exactly It would seem that they would inversely track equities Why? but that doesnt seem to be the case Yeah sometimes bonds correlate to stocks and sometimes anticorrelate. On average they have around neutral correlation. It would seem that any bond fund would have a basket of bonds of varying maturity. Many do though some have a single maturity. it seems that with a change in rates the entire basket would reprice. Yet it does not seem to be the case over the short run. Bond prices and yields are mathematically related so a change in yields of bonds definitely reprices a basket of those bonds. But yields of long term bonds will often anticipate changes in money market rates before the central bank officially changes their targets. And look beyond the short term rate policy to longer run macro conditions. And lower quality bonds have a credit component which higher quality bonds dont.,Neutral,0,0.9999843835830688,Reply

The interest is of course not a gain, but extra funds taken from your paycheck. Money not going towards bills, savings, etc. The repayments are fixed. Its impossible to get your HR to stop taking it from your paycheck. So if youre in a future tight bind youre kind of screwed. If you leavelose your job for any reason before the loan is paid off, you may owe the entire loan almost immediately. And if you cannot pay then you will default and owe income tax 10 penalty. This is painful enough as is, but consider theres 0 withholding on a loan so youll now owe it all out of pocket, all while youre looking for a new job.

If you can get 12 over inflation on debt from governments and large companies that are extremely unlikely to default, then nobody will buy into a company unless theres a good chance itll return more than that either by returning excess revenue in the form of dividends, or by reinvesting excess revenue in order to grow in value. Since theres volatility in equities, the expected return has to be significantly higher than the risk free rate in order for it to be worthwhile. If you can get 3 guaranteed, vs 6 10 then any given shorter term has a good chance of returning less than the risk free rate, but if you can afford to leave the money invested long enough the average will be higher and its worthwhile.",Positive,1,0.9866003394126892,Reply

That said, you may have another reason to put the assets in the LLC, eg, if there is some issue relating to ownership or succession planning for the equities and in that case its possible a trust might even be a better option. Of course, we dont know all the facts so an estatebusiness planning attorney may have better answers on this front.",Neutral,0,0.992077112197876,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-13,"The whole point of an LLC is to shield the LLCs owners from the actions of the LLC. If you run your business through an LLC, and the business creates a liability, then theoretically your personal assets can be protected. But it doesnt work the other way around. You cant just park assets in an LLC and have them be protected from personal liability. Say you run a business making shampoo, and your product makes peoples hair fall out. Thats a business liability. Your customers could sue the LLC and claim any assets in the LLCs name, but they may have trouble taking, say, your house or personal bank accounts. Thats what the whole idea of limited liability is for. But if you have other unrelated assets in the LLC, then those are the LLCs assets, and would be easier to reach in a civil action. Meanwhile, the protection does not work the other way. If your LLC holds 100k worth of stock, then your LLC is worth 100k. And if you own 100 of the LLC, then your LLC shares are worth 100k. And so if someone sues you, instead of taking your LLCs assets they could just take the LLC. Youve replaced one type of asset with another, with no net protection added. In practice it would probably not work exactly like that but you see my point. Anyway, your lawyers and accountants are probably happily accepting the fees they earn managing your LLCs for you. If you think theres any benefit, you should explicitly ask them what that benefit is.",Neutral,0,0.9986458420753479,Reply

If something happens and the owner is sued due to assets owned directly, the LLC itself and all directly owned assets are fair game.

Reddit,2024-09-13,"Yes, the biggest growers will be removed from the smallcap index at its next annual or quarterly reconstitution. A fund that tracks the index will sell those stocks and buy new smallcap stocks. Some of those stocks will grow out of the index next time. Meanwhile, the index fund is capturing the growth of all these stocks for the time while they are part of the index. Imagine that you profit from the growth of children by selling uniform clothing to the children in an elementary school. You profit from their growth while they are students at the school. Eventually, each child graduates and you lose that customer, but the school still has 600 students and youre still profiting from all of their growth. Same thing with the companies in the index fund. The fund owns a share of their growth until theyre too big, and then sells it and buys shares of smaller companies growth.",Neutral,0,0.9909886717796326,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-13,"Great question! Youre touching on an important aspect of how smallcap index ETFs work and grow over time. Lets break this down 1. Index Rebalancing Smallcap indices, like the SP SmallCap 600, are regularly rebalanced. This means that companies that grow beyond the defined market cap range are indeed removed and replaced with smaller companies. 2. Capturing Growth The idea behind smallcap indices is to capture the growth potential of smaller companies. While its true that the best performers eventually graduate out of the index, the index has benefited from their growth up to that point. 3. Continuous Cycle As some companies grow out of the index, new, potentially fastgrowing companies are added. This creates a continuous cycle of capturing growth at the smallcap level. 4. Historical Performance Historically, smallcap stocks have shown the potential for higher returns over long periods, albeit with higher volatility. This is often referred to as the smallcap effect. 5. Diversification Smallcap ETFs provide exposure to a segment of the market that behaves differently from largecaps, offering diversification benefits. 6. Growth Potential The bet, as youve correctly identified, is on the overall growth potential of smaller companies. While not all will succeed, the index aims to capture the aggregate growth of this segment. 7. Economic Factors Smallcaps can be more sensitive to economic cycles, potentially offering higher returns during economic expansions. Its worth noting that while some companies do grow out of the smallcap range, many remain within it for extended periods. The growth of the index isnt solely dependent on companies growing beyond the smallcap definition. Remember, while smallcap ETFs can offer growth potential, they also come with higher volatility and risk. Its important to consider your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and time horizon when deciding on asset allocation. Disclosures.",Positive,1,0.9251747727394104,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-13,"at some point some of the top growers cross the upper market cap level and are dropped from the index and replaced with other small cap companies and you stop to benefit from the best performing companies in the index. You are making the false assumption that companies that growout of the small cap space they will continue to be the best performing companies just because they grew well in the past. If your premise was correct then someone could make an ETF that consisted only of companies that got booted from the small cap index because they grew too much. Is it just a bet that most of small companies grow the fastest and as they grow too big they are dropped because it is believed that their growth will slow down? Its not like you have to stick all your eggs in one basket. You can own a small cap ETF, a midcap ETF and a largecap ETF in a single portfolio.

If it goes above 145 youre obligated to sell it at 145, even if it goes to 200. But you get the 390 no matter what so it will lower your cost basis or you sell the shares. The downside is you wont capture all the upside potential of it shoots way up. Heres a good video on covered calls. Once you understand them theyre very simple.

Reddit,2024-10-27,I got burned pretty badly on options a few years ago and now I just do old school investing and Ive come back pretty well.

That means for most people in the 24%bracket now, they would be in a 28% bracket if that happens, and your $2,400 tax on your gainwould be $2,800.She wants qualified, c-corp dividends taxed as ordinary income and she wants pass-through companies like REITs to pay corporate taxes.She wants the 21% top corporate tax rate on corporations (the one that affects RUN) to jumpto 28%, a 33% increase penalty on the wherewithal of RUN to make money for us. Mr. Trump wants the top corporate rate to be reduced to 15% so that companies can invest and grow.Most of us investors know that capital investment is the fuel that makes America&#39;s free-enterprisesystem capable of making the country prosperous. Amazingly, most Americans surveyed say theyprefer &#34;socialism&#34; over &#34;capitalism&#34;.

Yahoo,2024-08-01,"Just finished listening to Sunnova&#39;s earnings call, and there were numerous highlights that may pertain to what we&#39;ll hear in Sunrun&#39;s earnings calls next week.   They started to see business really pick up during May this year, and their June sales + building activity has already exceeded their normal season peak activity in August of every year. They are leaning towards cash discipline, cash generation, and paying down their debt.  So much so, it affects #3 below On the call, they actually admitted they can&#39;t handle this level of growth in the business (now that Sunpower is probably going out of business).  As of now, they are pausing the addition of new dealers.  They also addressed the rumors that Sunnova was slow-paying their dealers (see point #2 above).  They are vetting and forcing all currently dealers to comply with buying domestically-made solar modules + batteries by Sept 1...  because all new solar installs will then be ITC adder-compatible, and they can generate more cash by selling those ITC credits They were a little mum about expanding their operations in CA to fill the vacuum left by Sunpower.  The CEO basically said, &#34;we have been taking market share there,&#34; and that&#39;s it.The basic story: They want to expand, but they can&#39;t take full advantage of the situation because of their cash positions.  This probably bodes well for Sunrun in the near future, because Sunrun does more direct-sales than partnering with minor dealers, and their cash position is stable.",Neutral,0,0.6639932990074158,Main
