Reddit,2024-09-12,"You clearly didnt read a single thing about the company. I dont mean to be harsh but its clear that you didnt. Its not a consulting company or a business application. It used to be but it was acquired by JPE Brad Jacobs private equity. He is one of the best American executives that specializes in rollup companies 10 bagger in a waste management company bought by WM, founded URI, Founded XPO which spun off two other companies RXO and GXO. Now JPE bought SSNT the tech company and changed its ticker to QXO and committed about 6.5 billion to use it to rollup companies in the building products distribution industry. Its price fell because it increased unrealistically after the buyout announcement and the fact that there were too few shares available for trading. As soon as the new JPE shares were available for trading the stock fell to a realistic price of about 1.2 book value around 8 billion market cap to around 6.5 billion in cash.",Neutral,0,0.9961101412773132,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-12,"the management although they are really old Brad Jacobs is 68, its not like hes 90. the stock went up 40 in the last month, I know it doesnt mean much but as the stock price hit rock bottom recently, I thought it could only go up from there. The time to buy was after it cratered 80 in a day when the short squeeze broke. The business is currently a pile of cash at this point theres a reasonable limit to the upside. Longterm I think it will likely be another successful rollup from Brad Jacobs, but Id still be cautious about where to buy it and I think there will be better opportunities in the nearmid term after going up 43 in a month. Overall, I certainly like the business but after 43 in a month, I wouldnt be surprised if theres a bit of correctionconsolidation. Again, excellent leadership but its still a pile of cash at this stage and theres a point where the name is getting ahead of itself.",Positive,1,0.834119975566864,Reply

Yahoo,2024-09-21,"Here is where we stand with tax policy:Kamala Harris and Biden together stated last winter that they would liketo tax long-term capital gains as &#34;ordinary income&#34;. So, a QXO investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects QXO the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for QXO. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her.

Yahoo,2024-08-01,"Below is from Mike a couple days ago (which he posted ~ 1month earlier). Everyone buying before this week, talking class action or ponzi weren&#39;t paying attention.  And I think there&#39;s still likely more dilution coming based on filings (I&#39;m no expert). Offerings were around $9.50, so that seems to be (+/- 50%) where this ride truly begins. &#34;I said the following one month ago and it still holds true right now, but now there are EVEN MORE SHARES TO BE DUMPED after this second private offering:As spelled out in the deal … “the Purchase Agreements provide certain registration rights, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to register the resale of the Shares and the Warrant Shares. The Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale by the Investors of their Shares and the Warrant Shares within 15 business days following the closing of the Private Placement.”It is AMAZING that the stock price is still this high because retail investors are piling in right now. They will suffer soon.This will play out in one of 2 ways.First, it will steadily decline, up until the closing during the first half of July, down towards $10 area.Or, if retail buyers keep buying and hold the price from having that decline … then, since there is no lockup period, 15 days after the closing, the buyers will dump those 382.9 million shares they bought at $9.14, FOR HUGE PROFITS and thus drive the stock down bigtime towards $10 !!!&#34;",Neutral,0,0.9986660480499268,Main
