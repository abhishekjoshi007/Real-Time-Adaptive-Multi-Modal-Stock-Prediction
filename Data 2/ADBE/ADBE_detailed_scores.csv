Reddit,2024-08-01,"Your table is missing a key piece of data, analysts usually give 12 month price targets, so how accurate did the analysts price turn out to be 12 months later? Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks.",Neutral,0,0.6505180597305298,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,Ill be honest its really not. I came to knowast year that NVDA was priced above 700 pre split but I was scared and only invested in QQQM. It then crossed 1000. I read about analyst ratings about ISRG. I invested a small amount after some research. It has gone 20 since then and has been solid despite tech sell off. I think analyst ratings is helpful to screen companies and not go tits up.

Reddit,2024-09-10,"Well good luck to both of us. Stock is heavily levered w no full year guidance so theres good chance the stock moves a lot post earnings call up or down. Personally Im looking to see them issue 3QFY25 guidance of 1.5B of revenue and EPS of 0.02 and their Supplies Companion Animals revenue decline to slow down to 5 decline from the 6.8 decline they did last quarter. Unfortunately I have not sat outside a Petco counting shopping bags like that Bath Bodyworks WSB diligence so its anybodys guess whether theyre able to hit those numbers. With respect to the new CEO, I think itll be really disappointing if the new CEO Joel talks about the business the same way the last CEO Ron talked about the business e.g., growing revenue expanding gross margins, as I dont think those are credible growth avenues see my DD on Petco.

At the same time, they said the businessabsent a rebound in discretionary product saleswill not get back to 42 gross margin. Sounds like theres only room for 1 or 2 points of margin improvement.

Reddit,2024-09-07,"From the fundamentals side, I made a massive killing off Adobe calls last earnings. My thesis at the time was that their AI offerings were in a period of hype and they would have a massive uptick greater than expected as a result of trials and subscriptions from eager AI fanboys. At the time, Reddit groups on Adobe were very annoyed at the service and poor performance, and I predicted that if it went up big on those earnings, it would be brought down to earth big time during the next earnings as a triple whammy due to the three following issues 1. The AI hype would not materialize into meaningful growth 2. The core user base would be disenfranchised from the product 3.

Reddit,2024-09-07,"Thank you for sharing your thesis . I played ER on adobe in March , I got calls but then just before the actual earnings date , I closed my position , I capitalized on the volatility. Price plummeted after the ER, I was happy I sold my position . The earnings in June was a different story , the overall sentiment of the market was bullish , and ADBEs price was at support basically at 450 which is the 50 fib retracement , we all played calls . This time around I feel differently , price will follow a continuation to the downside. Price explores new levels of it finds acceptance , it consolidates and seeks further development . If price gets rejected it goes down to levels of support. So, I am looking for a 10 retracement give or take",Positive,1,0.9760430455207825,Reply

I couldnt justify 300mo for the volume and percentage of commercials I was forced to watch on live TV. My first streaming device was my Wii console and ultimately moved to Roku. Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to.

Reddit,2024-08-03,"The Fed isnt wrong, the bond market is bullyIng the Fed into cutting. There are no liquidity issues that would necessitate cuts inline with bond market pricing. Traders want to take advantage of the latest job numbers to make profitable their bond trades, and they will quickly dump back into stocks once they get the excess liquidity they want. Asset prices are still elevated so introducing excess liquidity would be problematic for combating inflation. QE caused wild asset inflation and that changes the dynamic. The Fed needs to get to 2 inflation and holding before it can comfortably cut. We cannot afford loosening monetary policy too early. Fed holds too long and causes a recession, fine. It cuts too soon and allows inflation to gain steam, thats a big problem.",Negative,-1,0.9999946355819702,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-03,"There are around 38 million people in poverty in the US and around 23 million millionaires. However did you realize that the majority of millionaires in the US are over the age of 50.

It is surprisingly easy to sort Americans by income and picking a random one that fits either category is also relatively simple. And no, Im not talking about people who dress fashionably or drive a Cybertruck as their daily driver. I mean that old couple that bought their house in the 60s and 70s and have been retried since the 90s. That doesnt change the fact that bottom wages dont keep up with inflation. Middle and high wages do, but bottom wages only change when the minimum wage is adjusted. Of course there are some jobs that are exceptions. Costco workers get inflation based adjustments as do Starbucks employees, but your average Dollar General, Wendys or Walmart employee is not getting inflation adjusted increases.

You then responded that America has a lot of millionaires to which I stated America has more people in poverty thank millionaires. You stated that 1.6 of people make minimum wage which is a completely inane and stupid metric to go by especially realizing that if you make 14.75 and minimum wage is 14 then you are making over minimum wages and said you gave references that you NEVER provided, so I instead gave a reference on American poverty directly from the American census which supports the statements I have made.

The demos from the upstarts are one-off creations and you can take your pick at who is &#34;better&#34; at text-to-image or text-to-video. Adobe is being more subtle and going after the entire creative/editorial workflow. Not as sexy and harder to explain, but it is where the proverbial rubber meets the road. Another poster to this board has noted that October is tax-loss harvesting season for funds, and Adobe fits the bill (it is down). The narrative is likely to change in Adobe&#39;s favor in 2025, when it delivers GenAI related revenue and an uptick in growth, in which case twelve months from now it won&#39;t be a TLC (tax loss candidate), because it will likely be up YTD and a momentum/growth play. This is not the first time Adobe has reinvented itself in response to rapid technological change -- recall the transition to SaaS subscription models where Adobe had to weather a short-term decline in GAAP revenue (upfront license revenue switching to monthly subscription) and educate analysts about ARR, which was tough, but the company came out smiling.

Yahoo,2024-09-22,"Here is where we stand with tax policy:Kamala Harris and Biden together stated last winter that they would liketo tax long-term capital gains as &#34;ordinary income&#34;. So, a ADBE investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects ADBE the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for ADBE. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know.
