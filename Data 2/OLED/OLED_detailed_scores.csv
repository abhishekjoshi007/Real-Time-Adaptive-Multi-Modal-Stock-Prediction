Yahoo,2024-08-07,"Blue being delayed to an unknown date has put fear and uncertainty into investors.  That and the market meltdown made this stock price dive somewhat overstated. That being said I believe short term this stock will continue to get pummeled and come back with Q3 results.  Unless some other news or conracts change this. Long term still looks good  but that date has been extended at least 6 months to mid 2025.

Pretty disappointed by the results and the Blue news.",Negative,-1,0.999991774559021,Main
