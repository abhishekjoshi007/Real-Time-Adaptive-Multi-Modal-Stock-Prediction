Frankly, the post is offensive.  \n\nOLED is a VERY financially strong company and the (by far) majority player in the industry with over 5500 patents. \n\nYou will find some extremely knowledgeable folks here regarding blue and I will leave it to them for the tech details.  But the business end is this.  OLED currently has emitters in Red and Green.  2/3 of RGB displays.  The B or blue is proving very difficult to bring to commercial specs but it WILL happen.  Listen or read the CC call of yesterday. \n\nThe problem is they have been holding the blue carrot in front of investors for a long time.  The recent run up I feel has been based on the anticipated blue coming to market and unfortunately has been pushed back again.  But it’s in its final R&amp;D stages. \n\nBut blue is not the only thing to focus on.  Growth of existing revenues is strong and merits your long position.  Be patient.  I am sure today doesn’t feel very good.  But OLED will benefit you in the coming months."
