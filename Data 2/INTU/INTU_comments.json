When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks."

The biggest argument is a high yield savings account HYSA will out pace it in a year. I think thats a bit short sighted because their acting like interest rates will never move lower, but their point still stands, currently you would be better off letting it sit and accumulate interest than bag holding. We dont even have to guess at a timeframe or anything. Just take what you would put in intel and calculate your balance in a high yield savings account over the next 2 years by month. That is literally what you are aiming to beat minimum, otherwise its actually a loss for your risk and effort. If in the next 30 days you sell for a 10 pop, great, but the company literally told everyone expect nothing for a year, and even after that, who boy, just know we are working hard and will update then. The longer you hold, the higher that needs to be just to beat the HYSA. Back to the short sightedness of the HYSA . 1 they probably are not doing that, its just a floor they are using to compare what they are doing with their money ex not giving two craps about a 1 dividend and trying to beat it. Their being smart and not marrying the play, stock or HYSA, and we all should be doing that. If the HYSA is no good, dump it and move to the next channel thats best at that time. The difference between intel and HYSA is you can get out of the HYSA at anytime with 0 loss and invest elsewhere, while Intel may have lost value. They 100 dont make perfect plays, but its hard for them to watch others make dumb plays that cant even track interest rates without saying anything. Bottom line, if you plan to be 100 passive, your picks are probably not best, especially if you refuse to pivot when terrible news shows up at the front page of every search engine. Thats why they keep screaming toss it in a fund to people who are doing this."

Options were originally intended as a way to hedge your positions, and most hedge funds and serious investors still use them for that purpose. It works something like this Say i bought 10000 shares of nvda a couple years ago. Its gone up huge, lets say i paid 10 a share and theyre worth 100 a share now. I could buy long dated like years puts betting on it going to 50 or less. The puts would be very cheap for me to buy because thats very unlikely to happen but now in case something terrible does happen and nvda does crash my puts will pay off and i wont lose everything.

                    "text": "I cut the cable in 2008 when my cablesatellite bill was above 300month not to mention the cost of the receivers. I couldnt justify 300mo for the volume and percentage of commercials I was forced to watch on live TV. My first streaming device was my Wii console and ultimately moved to Roku. Ive been an A La Carte viewer since and am still paying significantly less monthly than I was in 2008, and, unless I need to watch live News or an urgent Weather broadcast Im happy to watch my favorite shows a day or a month, season or year after the networks broadcast live. While I dont subscribe to Disney, Im a Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube premium, Pandora premium, Paramount with Showtime Peacock commercial free, Apple TV subscriber. The bottom line is I never run out of commercial free great movies, series, shows, documentaries, music, concerts, and global news to watch at my leisure and schedule in addition, my two kids and grandchild can watch pretty much whatever they love commercial free for significantly less than a commercial dominated satellite or cable broadcast which require a subscription for the better and best content anyway Im not a big sports aficionado, so I dont subscribe to the NFL or MLB streams, but know enough people to watch a game with if I really want to. When you get used to watching what you want without constant commercial interruptions, it becomes very difficult and annoying to watch commercials every few minutes. At least for me."

Also, with a dead cat bounce it would be more than a 0 2 recovery. The recovery is significant enough to believe that a bear trend is over. This is a correction, and Id expect itll be choppy for a bit, and who knows, maybe plenty more downside, but 2 days of red and a day of barely green doesnt fit the concept."

Asset prices are still elevated so introducing excess liquidity would be problematic for combating inflation. QE caused wild asset inflation and that changes the dynamic. The Fed needs to get to 2 inflation and holding before it can comfortably cut. We cannot afford loosening monetary policy too early. Fed holds too long and causes a recession, fine.

With a fixed mortgage, if inflation and wages rise 10, its like getting a permanent 10 discount on your single biggest purchase.

Moreover the fed didnt cut too late because they dont care about the stock market they care about employment you needed strong employment BECAUSE raising rates will inevitably affect it like it has now. The fact they could push this hard and get inflation as low as they have is because they waited so long. Dont get me wrong, theres still a lot that can and probably will go wrong, but considering what the fed had to work with partially their own fault tbh, if youre looking to criticize the fed theres plenty there at the end of 2018 but to do what theyve done is a credit to them."

Costco workers get inflation based adjustments as do Starbucks employees, but your average Dollar General, Wendys or Walmart employee is not getting inflation adjusted increases.

You stated that 1.6 of people make minimum wage which is a completely inane and stupid metric to go by especially realizing that if you make 14.75 and minimum wage is 14 then you are making over minimum wages and said you gave references that you NEVER provided, so I instead gave a reference on American poverty directly from the American census which supports the statements I have made.

Intuit’s fourth-quarter earnings surpassed expectations with a year-over-year growth of 17%, which is commendable, yet operating margins fell slightly short. While the company did manage a 19% year-over-year EPS growth, there are concerns about the sustainability of this growth moving forward. The primary reasons for the revenue outperformance in the fourth quarter appear to be tied to one-off benefits in the Desktop business and strong performance in Credit Karma, which may not be indicative of long-term trends.\nWeiss’s assessment also takes into account the changing dynamics in Intuit’s growth strategy. The forecast for fiscal year 2025 shows limited EPS upside, despite the company’s efforts in reducing headcount. The shift towards a greater reliance on Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC) growth in the Small Business sector and a reduced contribution from the Consumer segment may introduce new challenges."
