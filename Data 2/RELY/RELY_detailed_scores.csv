Its about blocking the deliberate and patent creation of a exploitive monopoly, something thag is in FTCs mandate to prevent. And by doing so, with unanimous confirmation by every qualified expert, it sends a proactive message to other corrupt opportunist in any sector or business who might have wanted to try their luck at flouting our antimonopoly laws. Some who understand this deeper reasoning may still complain that truly big monopolies or oligopolies are not being held to account as strictly.

Reddit,2024-10-25,"I dont understand this approach personally, putting 30 in a single company like this, especially a company like MSFT at this stage, which although pretty safe I dont find it a compelling investment. I think theres a decent chance of moderate outperformance of VOO, and a decent chance of underperforming, and very little chance of vastly outperforming. If I were going to buy MSFT, it would be one of my safety plays, not a bet on particularly good returns. I think psychologically its a bad idea to choose only one stock also. Is it worth the negatives which also include missing out on alternative investments, and being so attached to the fortunes of a single company. If its 2 or even 5 and its not moved after a year or two or even down a little, well you can live with that, but with 30 that wouldnt be nice to underperform even VOO with that percentage over that time.

Entering the fourth quarter, samestore backlog is 21 higher than it was at this time last year, and we are experiencing unprecedented strength in our pipelines.

Im bullish on AIs longterm potential, but youre right that its not guaranteed to be smooth sailing, and it could play out more like those disruptive growth themes from a couple of years ago. Not every AIfocused company will win, and your example with Recursion really shows how even companies tied to AI can struggle. I definitely need to consider more balance and look into those secondary plays that might be safer if the hype doesnt go 100 as planned.

It was yours, you didnt need Cisco until you were upgrading. I realize they sold support, but you didnt need that if you had adequate staff. With AI, things are centralizing into massive clusters owned by FAANG. Its just so expensive to host large models like gpt, only they can do it. You cant just take gpt home, you need to rent it, which brings in recurring revenue.

When you deconstruct LEUs balance sheet and remove the GAAP distortions, you get much higher valuations as LEU includes many things in its earnings category that inflate its value.

The revenue has been increasing for past 4 years with profit margin 25. Yes, I know thats what the official 10K and 10Q reports say. Unfortunately, retail investors are rarely privy to accurate accounting data.

I dont understand how the PE can go from 15 to 90. If that is indeed true then is the company is cooking up data? Im confused lol. Yes and no. The problem is with how GAAP allows companies to categorize revenue, earnings, goodwill, free cash flow, etc. They get considerable optionality in what they include or dont include. This means company balance sheets are incompatible. Even if theyre in the same GICS subindustry, they are using a different set of criteria for what are putatively the same metrics. Additionally, they get penalized when their accountants arent savvy enough to play the game properly. Mind you, for the last two decades the correlation between stock prices and earnings has considerably strengthened. Investors expect earnings to continuously grow and beat analyst expectations. It is in the companies best interests to fudge the headline numbers to make themselves look as good as possible.

Ive come to learn over time, that not every investment will work out well, but Ive been saying that idea of HVAC, physical data center, electrification, onshoring, and government spending via the infrastructure and IRA act as macro tailwinds for years in this sub. Im a software engineer, so the data center stuff made a ton of sense and kind of falls into buy what you know style of investing. Never try to think of myself as an expert, but at least using a screener has taught me discipline and how to find a style of investment. Pair that with being able to think for yourself about trends, you can see success. I always talk about thats the main reason why I think people underperform the market in general. They dont think for themselves and they dont do things like screen for companies, because that takes time and research. Much easier for people to get a tip from someone or online and run with it. Like some of the newer stuff Ive been buying into is around naval companies and components for drones. The naval stuff is because we are way behind in the US in what we need and we dont build here. The United States effectively gave up on commercial shipbuilding during the Reagan administration in the name of free trade. In the decades that followed, generous state subsidies helped China dominate commercial shipbuilding, and Beijings requirement that the sector be dualuse resulted in an industry that can shift to production and ship repair for the military during a conflict, much as U.S. shipyards did during World War II. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates that China now has 232 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States. China built almost half the worlds new ships in 2022, whereas U.S. shipyards produced just 0.13 percent Rebuilding the arsenal of democracy that anchored the U.S. victory at sea 80 years ago wont happen overnight or cheaplyit is a generational project. The 20year Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program aimed at upgrading dry docks, facilities, and equipment will end up costing well over the projected 21 billion But the plan is only intended to maximize existing U.S. industrial capacity and wont do much to close the enormous shipbuilding gap with China. That would require a reconstitution program on par with the series of maritime laws passed after World War I, which supported the expansion of an industrial base eventually capable of turning out thousands of carriers, destroyers, submarines, frigates, and cargo ships for the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.",Neutral,0,0.9996064305305481,Reply

There are going to be longerterm beneficiaries beyond just owning tech. That said, I think these beneficiaries are definitely going to be more specific than owning indexes. This thread also goes into all the reasons why AI has disappointed while talking about beneficiaries it doesnt seem like youre that confident in the ability to deliver on the end products when it comes to AI. 2 I think the timing is very difficult. I dont disagree with what youre saying in regards to spending and Ill admit that I thought this cycle would be a giant version of smaller previous NVDA cycles and it still probably will, but on a longermuch longer time frame than Id expected. Yes, mega cap tech is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on this. No, shareholders dont really care yet and what does it take to change so many peoples one investment playbook from basically own mega cap tech? I dont know and to try and predict thatcall the top because one thinks its an eventuality without any indications of things starting to erode is going to lead to disappointment. So, I dont disagree with some of the things you mention but the specifics are tough I do think that theres an interesting conversation about AI beneficiaries. I talked about VST early this year on here as an AI beneficiary and the response was crickets because it was like nobody wanted to hear anything AIrelated that wasnt tech. Mag 7 have had a good year, but things that are beneficiaries of all that spending NVDA primarily, but things like VRT have had a better year imo. I mean, two of the top performing stocks this year are utilities that have mooned because of expected energy demand. I think that there are potentially interesting discussions on peoples guesses for beneficiaries in terms of productivity and theres not enough discussion on here of whats being impacted call center software FIVN clearly not a beneficiary.

This tech is longer duration, has no fire risk, emits no noise, and can be stacked as densely as you can imagine. Lots of new catalysts coming up, and has gone from 5.60 in September 2023, down to 0.60 in May 2024 on bankruptcy risks, but recently had a great investment from Cereberus that has caused a massive rally from 0.60 to 3.30. It pulled back this week to 2.79 and is now back at 3.02. If you want to learn more, check out twitter for EOSE or even do some research yourself aboput the tech, their backlog, and the financing agreement with Cereberus.

Maybe too much so, but thats been the strategy Ive been more comfortable with for now. But definitely something Im still trying to improve on, getting the buy level right based on volatility and fundamentals and growth prospects. I bought AEHR a couple of days ago, and went in at a kind of middle level that I was quite comfortable with no matter the short term price action due to it being a very volatile stock despite my conviction being very high, and Im pretty satisfied but still left with the niggling feeling that I should have gone a little higher to really match my level of conviction. Its easy to take a biased view now that the price is up premarket after earnings though. Then again the price change is not so drastic that I cant still quite comfortably add to my position considering its a not a quick trade Im making. Trying to assess each trade in isolation I think is key, and not letting previous burnswins cloud your judgement.

I have some stocks that I see as very high momentum that I bought mostly just to trade short term that Im keeping a close eye on in particular and will hope to sell in the next year and others that I plan to hold for the long term. I thought I was clever when I sold Meta for 300 after buying fairly close to lows, and Ive seen it go on to 600 from afar. I think on the whole the fewer decisions I make the better regarding buying and selling if interested in a company longer term. Im still reassessing fairly often though. Im hoping to in the future not be buying and selling much and just have my established positions for the most part, every now and then open a new one and trade options when good opportunities arise. My actions right now also have tax in mind though, I dont want to have a big tax bill next year from selling companies in profit but have wanted to invest in some companies I didnt have spare cash waiting for so I exited positions I was down or flat on. Edit But to answer your original question more plainly I dont have a clear profit taking strategy other than selling if I think a valuation has gotten way ahead of what can be justified.

I shouldve emphasized the problem was with parttime and not seasonal. With their operating margins rolling over due to spiking service inputs and being forced to operate as loss leaders to retain market share, those businesses are not hiring fulltime workers. Theyre hiring a lot of new bodies but not for the longterm. We all know fulltime had a couple bad prints.

We should be seeing secular decreases in parttime work and secular increases in fulltime work. What are your predictions for the market? Im tactically bearish until the end of October.

Then well have the typical postelection November and December surge, and investors should stay bullish until mid2025.

Longterm Im bearish on the major indices because valuations are too bloated Bank of America arrived at the same conclusion on 19 of their 20 metrics.

I disagree about the tail risk. It seemed silly to think the Nasdaq 100 would do anything but go up in 1999, only for it to drop 83 by 2002. Valuations are crucial to estimating future gains, not because of raw price but due to time. The problem with most bears is they dont understand how to read the market or prepare downside protection. They assume the worst and run around like Chicken Little. There are reliable indicators that presage a market crash, which most investors dont look at, and they are not flashing right now. So Im not worried. I am referring to 12 month forward earnings. 12month forward earnings are risibly overstated. Ive addressed this topic extensively several times by breaking down the components of earning growth that accord with Bloomberg analysts projections, and the head of investment at Wells Fargo has echoed my criticism. In short, analyst assumptions regarding disinflation and sales growth mean profit margin growth must increase from 1.7 the 25year average to 6.5. This will justify the 15 earnings growth thats expected next year and the 8.6 afterwards. There is no catalyst justifying this assertion. Additionally, they are projecting EBIT margins to rise to 18 and plateau when the historical average since 2001 has been 13. This is based on misreading why EBIT margins reached 18 in 2022.

Reddit,2024-10-04,"Sure... although its really bizarre that someone that claims to understand valuation does not understand the impact of using even a 3.7 riskfree rate to a DCF? Please. This is at least the fifth time youve gotten into an argument with me under an alternate account youre incapable of hiding your tells and its quite tiring to hear the same insults when youre using said models in a naive fashion. Bluntly, your usage of the discount rate is backwards. Im not sure how you managed to do this as I assume you know how the discount rate works. If you apply a 3.7 discount rate or any discount rate higher than the baseline to a DCF model, you get a reduced valuation. Lower discount rates raise equity valuations. Your baseline discount rate for the top equation is 0. Your conclusion only make sense if you were finding the delineation point where a stock with 1 growth in cash flow and 0 terminal growth would justify a 3.7 discount rate at 44 over 10 years. That is, its growth would have to be 5. Or you were highlighting the impact of a 3.7 discount rate to the base case and comparing that to its complete removal. Lets go a little deeper. Since you dislike WACC for legitimate reasons, then the cost of equity should be your discount rate after all, we are talking about holding equity stock, not holding debt or preferred shares. That would be the 10year Treasury yield beta x equity risk premium. Historically the 10year has stayed rangebound between 4.254.75 when the FFR was at 2.503. The FFR dictates SOFR and shortterm rates, but it has very limited power over longterm rates. Well assume beta is equal to the SP i.e. 1. Therefore, the discount rate would be 4.50 1 x 54.5 5. Alternatively, lets be generous and assume you meant 2.75 the difference between the peak FFR and the FFR target. The two problems are that the 10year Treasury yield is the basis of the riskfree rate for your DCF model and the baseline for deviation is not zero, plus the 10year yield does not move proportionally with the FFR. A company with as little as 5 growth and 0 terminal growth will be worth 41x todays cashflows. That number skyrockets if you allow for more growth likely for many tech names and instead of 0 growth you allow for at least inflation growth of 2 or so. No, that applies to a 0 discount rate. The lower the riskfree rate, the lower the discount rate and the higher the valuation. Im sorry. If you do not understand that tail risk is less, chances are you do not understand how the modern Fed works at a basic operational level, or all the myriad of changes both the financial system and more importantly Fed have undergone in just the last few years. The possibility of economic catastrophe has been lessened at the expense of making the system more fragile and more dependent on intervention and creating new tail risks. Im sorry but if you dont understand that, you dont understand complex systems theory and emergent behavior. In fact, weve already seen this play out over the last 4 years. Additionally, I find it hilarious that youd come to that false conclusion considering Im the only person on this entire subreddit that talks about the Feds inner mechanisms at length. Also, Im the only one who explains how money markets actually operate. Because hes no longer trying to significantly outperform. Hes made it clear hes catering to a group of investors who want stability and steady appreciation with a lot less risk than the typical stock. Besides, hes not selling off the vast majority of his holdings. Thats not true. Hes talked about this very issue at several conferences. Berkshires entire problem is that its so large, the number of companies it can invest in without outright ownership or destroying price discovery is tiny. The companies Buffett used to buy wouldnt give Berkshire enough capital appreciation to register in their quarterly reports, not even if they tripled or quadrupled. He is stuck with choosing from large companies instead of the ones that made him famous. This is a similar problem with most large hedge funds, and a big underlying reason why they often fail to outperform the market. They are pressured to prove they can contribute more alpha to clients versus putting money in SPY or QQQ, but they have limits on how types of companies they can invest in. So they end up taking undue risk, chasing momentum, or secretly indexing while subtracting management fees from alpha. Fair, we seem to agree on that. What is your base case for EOY 2025?

Which is basically ridiculously risk averse and will only work out if we have a big crash. Note that is only his cash. His positioning is enormously bullish on a softlanding or even no landing if you look at his entire portfolio of owned businesses.",Neutral,0,0.9296478033065796,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"Noticing a common contradiction on both Twitter Reddit You cant simultaneously think the US is in a recession and labor markets cooling substantially and that core inflation is overheating. You gotta pick one. There is certainly no energy crisis like in the 1970s in fact, energy is currently very very cheap adjusted for inflation, so noncore inflation is fine. Rates are already 5 while inflation is at 2.7 and QT is ongoing, so conditions arent exactly that easy. I think its fine if you think were approaching a recession, and also that the Fed is going to easy economy is too hot. But if you think both are true simultaneously, I cant help but conclude you just want the economy to roll over so you can be right about being bearish.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"FT Chinese equities have surged to their best week since 2008 after Beijing launched an economic stimulus package including a 114bn war chest to boost the stock market. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhenlisted companies is up 15.7 per cent for the week in its best performance since November 2008, when China announced a similar stimulus package in response to the global financial crisis. Is China having its version of the US March 2009 stock trough? Its really hard to read through the headlines, but it seems the consensus is this is not the usual boring stimulus we might hear about every few months. This is the first time that the government is encouraging leveraged investment in the stock market. A liquidityleveraged rally should still have significant room to go. Bloomberg says the Tuesday announcement was a rare televised press conference. The Politburo promised to act immediately and go all out to implement the additional policies. A strong Chinese market is going to boost a bunch of emerging market economies, including Europe. Sorry, I couldnt help myself Chinese consumers are big customers of all the European luxury autos fashion brands. It will likely boost up revenue for commodity producing nations Indonesia, Australia, S. Africa... US even. Its been fashionable to call for the collapse of the Chinese economy for decades.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"For that one guy today who says inflation is going to reignite because the Fed cut 50 bps recently. Where is reaccelerating of inflation coming from? The commodity market is dead and has been for a while. Consumer savings are near all time lows, credit card debt is near all time high while credit card delinquency rates are sky rocketing, hence the consumer is clearly weakening, just look at companies that are consumer discretionary earnings report. Consumers are tapped out and being more choosy with their dollars and buying less. Inflation comes from an imbalance between supply and demand. Just cause the fed cut 50 bps doesnt mean this is going to do ANYTHING to increase demand in the next few months. You do realize a 50 bps cut will take just as long to have an effect as the hikes did, we wont see any effects from this cut probably until 2026. Job openings are crashing. Unemployment is going up, and theres no reason for that trend not to continue. Historically, once the velocity of unemployment starts to meaningfully rise, which it has Sahm Rule it doesnt just stop and it continues its momentum upward. Lower job openings and Higher unemployment will lead to even less demand and lower inflation moving forward. If the Fed cut by 200 bps and announced stimulus checks, then yes it would say probably not a good idea at this point. But a 50 bps is gonna do nothing to reignite inflation at this point. Edit Ill add, inflation is either going to come from a decrease in supply or increase in demand when you boil it down. We had massive supply chain issues during Covid, which have since been resolved, hence one of the reasons why inflation came crashing down so fast. Inflation doesnt ONLY come from companies raising prices, it also takes a consumer to be willing to buy those goods at higher prices. The consumer is showing they are no longer willing to pay higher prices and are being much more choosy on the products they are buying relative to the price. Countless companies are loosing pricing power and saying in their earnings reports they cant pass the cost along to consumers anymore. So supply has been fixed, demand has been fixed, this is why inflation is trending so fast back to the Feds preferred 2 goal. The Fed and Jerome Powell have also said numerous times if you wait till inflation is actually at 2 before cutting youve waited too long, which I 100 agree with since the rate cuts and hikes work with long and variable lags and take time to have an effect on the economy.",Neutral,0,0.8990469574928284,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"So let me get this straight, core PCE almost 2, PCE index on a 3month and 6month annualized is 2, more rate cuts coming to 3.XX in 2025, global rate cuts everywhere since everyone just follows the Fed, GDP growth at 3, China finally getting their head out of the sand, Saudis deciding to pump instead of artificially propping prices up reducing consumer and producer expenses, AI spend still strong and Microsoft reopening a nuke reactor. How is this not an everything rally into 2025? Literally buy everything! Sucks for the bears that sold because of some vague notion that rate cuts cause a huge 2008like bear market. Rate cuts due to falling inflation and stable economy is literally the most bullish macro environment for stocks. Stocks dumped on valuation because risk free rates rise, yet nominal earnings and revenue increases faster than ever due to high inflation. A reverse of this means valuation rerating higher on top of already inflated nominal earnings, this is why the postinflation 1980s and 1990s were so good, especially for value, it was a generational rise and then fall in inflation. Now we literally have a second miniversion of this, so obviously there would be a similar late 80s and 90s boom. The AI boom out of nowhere started the bull market early, so the market seems expensive, but the other 495 and 2000 small cap stocks have still a ways to go.",Positive,1,0.8806228637695312,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-27,"Rate cuts due to falling inflation and stable economy is literally the most bullish macro environment for stocks The most bullish macro environment for stocks is the bottom of a bear market. You get to buy highquality stocks at a large discount and upwards EPS revisions creates the same multiple compression one looks for in a growth stock but you get the same bonus across the board. Sucks for the bears that sold because of some vague notion that rate cuts cause a huge 2008like bear market. Theyre simply wrong in trying to draw a direct historical analogy. Its not the same environment and any recession, if there is one, is not imminent. Although they are tightening standards, the debt capital markets are not drying up in interaction volume like back in 2000 or 2007. Stocks dumped on valuation because risk free rates rise, yet nominal earnings and revenue increases faster than ever due to high inflation. Yes, and this creates the problem of inflated earnings expectations. Unlike the majority of analysts Bloomberg polled, I dont see SP earnings hitting 270 next year. We would not be cutting rates in a macro environment where that is possible. Unlike the late 70s80s, the indices rose overall as the Fed maintained high but historically normal rates. A reverse of this means valuation rerating higher on top of already inflated nominal earnings, this is why the postinflation 1980s and 1990s were so good, especially for value, it was a generational rise and then fall in inflation. The postinflation 1980s and 1990s were so good because aggregate valuations were historically low the SP was sub10 from 7885. Inflation doesnt have a linear relationship with stock returns. Now we literally have a second miniversion of this, so obviously there would be a similar late 80s and 90s boom. The AI boom out of nowhere started the bull market early, so the market seems expensive, but the other 495 and 2000 small cap stocks have still a ways to go. We wont everything is simply too expensive. Historically, small caps dont outperform until the generals collapse.",Positive,1,0.6642315983772278,Reply

Their business model is now entirely dependent on the uppermiddle class and above to travel to the high priced resorts, which is not good strategy.

Reddit,2024-09-27,Your point of view was ubiquitous on this sub in 2022 it was not true then and it is still not true now. But seriously lets follow through with your thoughts you must think that the fed should hold rates until inflation drops to 2. If they do that high chance of recession and deflation which is bad for everyone. But if they start cutting now inflation should still drop as rates are still restrictive rates inflation are restrictive and they can maybe thread the needle of a soft landing ie inflation coming down with no recession ie good for everyone. So far the fed has threaded this needle very well why would they risk keeping rates high and a high chance of recession for the small chance inflation will come back? Particularly when what theyve been doing thus far has been working so well?

Boeing cannot produce 737s while the workers are on strike, which means Boeing isnt getting their 100M cash deposit per day. This isnt factoring in the loss of revenue due to the Everett site being affected, which produces the 777F, 777X, and 767F, 767T. Everett makes up the other 50 million of costs. This 150M in lost revenue cash is what is causing the multitude of cost cutting measures such as furlough.

Reddit,2024-09-25,"Couple of things really stood out to me in this article. IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a very strong position, Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a reputational level too. Im absolutely on the side of the workersunion here. However, I suspect that Boeing doesnt really care about their reputation here as much as people think, or the public support behind the union. They have a near monopoly in their business, at least in terms of output capacity which is desperately needed in a critical field. It feels like poison saying it but that affords them the privilege to ignore reputation damage for a long time. Theres no where else for buyers to go, they have to deal with Boeing, trashed reputation or not. However this strike ends I suspect Boeing will push to move 737 production out of the PNW into areas like Atlanta and SC where unions arent as protected. Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October. This is going to be the downfall of Boeing that leads to some sort of inevitable government bailout. Shareholder primacy and value extraction mindset has been taken further and further over the cliff the last 50 years. Even with all of the recent revelations about the company, shareholders DEMAND the next quarter earnings be turned around. Its clear to anyone whos ever worked in any type of operations role that Boeing needs a solid 510 year turn around cycle to get it back on track, break even sure but put aside profits. Shareholders wont allow a reinvestment into the company.

However, I dont know enough about corporate structures to have any feeling that Boeing cannot fail. Like, its a good play if Bleing will definitely be here, but you couldve said that about Intel until Monday when rumors started that Qualcomm was going to make a play for the design division. Like, Boeings main money maker is their contracting division. Its a good long play IF that division never gets bought, but could Lockheed swoop in and make an offer to carve out a slice of the company? Could someone else?

Reddit,2024-09-25,"This short timeline shows that there are issues accross the board in multiple part of the whole manufacturing process. There are a LOT of whistleblowers that talk about unsafe manufacturing process or directives. The amount of issues seen in the last few years with Boeing planes all points to systemic failure in the manufacturing and quality control of planes. The fact that you try to somehow convince me that it is not Boeings fault but their suppliers or subcontracting entities fault is laughable. Even if it was, it is absolutely Boeings fault that they let the work of suppliers and subcontractors be the cause of so many issues by not applying proper quality control and mamufacturing reviews. This all point to systematic cost cutting in QC and Boeings own manufacturing capabilities that heavily inpacted Boeings ability to identify and solve issues before they cause accidents. Cheaper isnt always better, especially when you are talking about planes. But I guess shooting a you know nothing makes you feel good and important, so please be my guest.",Negative,-1,0.9920395612716675,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-20,"In North America, there is another problem a good chunk of the companys sales around 40 per cent in 2022 still come from department stores. Many of these are struggling with falling foot traffic or are closing down. Selling its wares directly online and via retailers such as Sephora and Ulta helps. But the company also needs to be more savvy in marketing through social media and TikTok influencers. Its operating margin of 6.2 per cent is less than a third of what LOreal made in 2023. Estee Lauder is in need of a makeover They let Elf win on social media and Elf won on value, which has certainly been a positive in the last couple years winflation. Between that and 40 of sales still from department stores, feels like a business where what theyve done has worked for decades so why change, then all the sudden things start to fall apart.

Reddit,2024-09-17,"Has gone largely nowhere since Fall of 2005 and Ive seen more than a couple of discussions about housingland value in the time since. Land inof itself isnt a positive see also TRC. Produce is a commodity and agribusiness like this is inconsistentvolatile. Water rights are a plus. If you have land and you dont have great management and there isnt some sort of end goal to monetize the whole thing, youre going to have a stock that looks like this or TRC is another, similar example. For all the Ackman presentations and various discount to NAV stories about Howard Hughes HHH over the years, its still way under where it was when there was the Baby Buffett Forbes cover story from 2015 about Ackman potentially turning it into his Berkshire. Real estaterelated companies like the above three that are real estate companies with a mix of assets and that arent REITs often have difficulty attracting an audience and for all the look at the land! they continually trade at some degree of a discount. I think Ive read dozens of HHH sum of the parts thesis reports over the years and yet, after all that, it wasnt bought by Brookfield or Blackstone, its Ackman who has been the one buying it up in the last year or so and maybe he eventually does turn it into his Berkshire, but if thats the case the purchase price will still probably be under where it was when that article was written. Nothing against it and hope you do well, but this has basically been volatile within a range for almost 20 years. IMO, that will most likely continue to be the case as a public company they need to look at a sale. As a public company, all of the assets will likely continue to trade at a discount detailed discussion of NAVdiscount here , so best case at this point is a compelling sale to someone else. As that link notes, being a public company the only reason why they became a public company in the first place was because they eventually had enough shareholders to require reporting hasnt really benefitted it much. The CEO who has been the CEO now for 20 years said pretty much the same last year when it was announced that they were looking at strategic alternatives The value the market perceives we have versus what we believe is the intrinsic value theres always been a big difference between those two things, said Harold Edwards, who has been Limoneiras CEO since 2004. The idea is that maybe theres a better way for us to operate. Maybe theres a better ownership structure that isnt public. Maybe its private, or maybe its merging together with another public company. TLDR As a public company, the next 10 years will probably resemble the last 10 years. Its better off as a private company and if they can get a good offer, some of the value that has been discounted in this for eons will be unlocked. That said, the strategic alternative discussion started late last year and has been reflected to some degree in the move that has occurred this year. If a sale doesnt happen, this is going to go lower again.",Positive,1,0.9666227102279663,Reply

And the fact that they only work in a few small geofenced areas greatly limits the value of the product, and basically makes it useful ONLY for robotaxis, even though theres countless other use cases for it that could be just as if not even more lucrative.

The average return from 20202023 was 7. Prior to this excluding those years the average September return was 0.05 basically flat. There have been some very bad Septembers but more than half have been positive and there have been some very good ones. Overall even prior to recent years, flat returns on average are not good.

Reddit,2024-09-13,"i wouldnt buy at 100 Boeing spent 43B on stock buybacks between 2013 and 2019 while paying their CEO 30Myear. To support its share price, the company under McNerney poured billions into stock buybacks instead of investing profits into the kind of research and development needed to stay competitive. McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the planes pitch without input from the pilot. McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first nonunionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called Partnering for Success that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more. Many feared that squeezing suppliers would harm the quality of their components, but McNerney was determined to recoup the cost of the 787s development if the subcontractors complained, they could find their work taken away from them, as happened to landinggearmaker United Technologies Aerospace Systems. McNerney retired in 2015, handpicking his successor, president and COO Dennis Muilenburg. Over the next three years, Boeings stock price more than doubled as it sold new planes the world over. As Bloomberg News reported, Muilenberg and McNerney had personal reasons to emphasize productivity and costcutting because their compensation was tied to share performance. Together they took 209 million in total pay over seven years.",Neutral,0,0.9767796397209167,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-06,"I like E. Warren for her morals, not so much for her practical proposals. She quotes ARM deal, which antitrust blocked. What is she complaining here about exactly? Nvidia locking the software and hardware bundle? Do they expect Nvidia to pour millions in making Cuda work natively across all architectures including competitor ones? Nvidia isnt really preventing competitors to write their own drivers or translation layers for cuda applications in fact, theres two projects for that, ZLUDA and SCALE. The real question here is why competitors havent spent more money for having their hardware make most of the the ML software stack? Like alternative backendslibrariesdrivers for anything from Pandas to whatever. They have slept for a decade while Nvidia was gifting their GPUs to any research laboratory asking for it, it was only natural most of the ML research was built on Nvidias stack. Im not sure whether Nvidia is now cornering customers with monopolistic behavior and I dont fully believe it either. They should obviously leverage their position, but no ones preventing Microsoft from having a huge deal with AMD or Intel and rewriting whatever they need in the stack to work better with that hardware. Nvidia did pull already such shit in the past think of physx and their lame excuse that it could only run on their hardware, when it run on CPUs mostly anyway and some other stuff. But why should they have the incentive on opening their software stack to competitors?

Reddit,2024-09-06,"A steady trend of labor market degradation in the United States There is little doubt where this is all headed. A year ago at this time of year, the threemonth average of nonfarm job creation was at 211k, and now its only 116k 142k in August, and the longterm norm is about 190k per month. At the same time, the data for June and July were revised sharply downward by 30 or minus 86k from 293k total for the two months to 207k employed. Its still better to count in percentages, as as the economy and population grows, you need more and more employment growth in absolute terms to have a commensurate effect. The 3month average is 0.07 per month, the YTD average is 0.11, and the 12month average is 0.12, while the mediumterm rate before COVID 20172019 was 0.13 per month and the 10year longterm rate is 0.16. The visible deterioration started in June and the data is about half as bad as the longterm trend in job creation. Its not a crisis requires at least three months of job contraction or a recession a rate of about 0.03 per month averaged over 36 months, but the first clear signal. It should be taken into account that BLS manipulates data and recently lost over 800 thousand employed, yesterday they revised the data for the worse by 30 and it is not excluded that soon we will find out that all this is a complete fake and the economy is in recession since spring 2024. Its important to note the structural degradation Native American workers have lost about 1.5 million jobs since the beginning of 2020, replaced by over 3 million migrants mostly from Mexico. More than 2 million parttime lowwage jobs have gained over the past year with nearly 1.5 million fulltime jobs lost. Where is the job growth concentrated? Over the past year, 85 of service sector jobs were in health care, trade, food service and entertainment mostly lowpaying jobs, while IT is cutting employment and banks and professional and business services the highest paying have the smallest rate of growth since early 2008.

Reddit,2024-09-06,"Werent you not long ago talking about a commodity super cycle. That seems laughable right now with many commodities in free fall. Yes, and none of the factors in my thesis have been contradicted. Recession fears and Chinas slowing economy have currently depressed copper and oil futures. Yet gold is still at alltime highs, silver is still in a structural deficit amidst growing demand, and natural gas is growing in demand worldwide. Copper will be necessary in any effort at nationwide electrification, either in China or the U.S.. And as long as clean energy is being pushed, it will be a necessary commodity. BTW I was correct in calling out coppers May rise as an unsustainable short squeeze. You didnt need to be an economist to do this, just a trader. Are you an economist? Because Slok is highly respected on the street. Im a trader. I was training to be one until the discrepancies between theory and reality became too obvious to ignore. Again, youre conflating credentialism with accuracy. Paul Krugman is also highly respected on the street yet he was wrong on the 2008 economic crisis, the future of the Internet, the secondorder impacts of globalization, etc. Eugene Fama is still highly respected on the street despite EMH being an empirical, incoherent failure of a system.

Respectfully, you claim to be just as smart as these guys, slam them, trash the entire profession, but it sounds more like you couldnt hack it, no offense. Please. Economics is not hard, and these guys arent that smart. The really smart economists e.g. Mirowski, Syll, Turgot, Keen are almost never establishment figures. Even Schumpeter was considered outdated in his era compared to the Keynesians. Furthermore, Ive gotten plenty of market calls correct I called the copper short squeeze in May. I predicted the July rotation into small caps was a false narrative peddled by sellside analysts. If you looked at diverging credit spreads and the call volume, it was clear that the IWMs rise was a gamma squeeze on the financial segment of the index. There wasnt enough liquidity into small caps independent of IWM rebalancing to warrant that call. So far, the election cycle prediction is going swimmingly. Still waiting on gold to hit 2600, but its broken 2500. Can you point out those papers you claim demonstrate the issues with the field? If you are so right and they are all wrong, why didnt you publish your novel research? I did as part of my PhD thesis. Pointing them out would show my real identity, so no thanks. You have the false notion that papers magically change the landscape. The validity of an economic thesis has very little impact on adaptation after all, its nighimpossible to put these into practice on a large enough scale to empirically prove them. The political landscape and role economists are cast into within the theory are more predictive of its acceptance. For example, Inelastic Markets Hypothesis has been around for 3 years, yet has had no appreciable effect on academic economics outside of heterodox study. It has a far better grounding in actual market activity than EMH, but EMH is far alluring to economists. It provides an atomistic view of human behavior that allows economists to model their aggregate interaction in a manner akin to particle physics. By assuming all participants are rational and keenly correct in their selfinterest, the market is selfcorrecting and constantly shifts back to equilibrium. It slots in nicely with the rise of neoliberal philosophy after the failure of neoKeynesianism to deal with 1970s stagflation. Exogeneous i.e. government intervention is seen as deleterious interference the market can process all information and make the proper decisions spontaneously. It allows economists to see themselves as beyond social and political criticism. Unlike certain theories cough cough Keynesianism, EMH is deemed by its practitioners to be neutral and more akin to a scientific discipline.

Reddit,2024-09-06,"How about this socalled paper you published? It focused on how market crashes offer a comprehensive rebuke to Efficient Market Hypothesis, as the prerequisite conditions for a crash could not be reached under its guiding assumptions. Then it expanded to discuss the general pitfalls of mechanistic models of the market e.g. the inability to offer explanations of anomalies that can be explained in terms of social contagion, information asymmetry and varying interpretation, fractal distribution of principal, liquidity flows functioning as information instead of expressions of value, and the emergent properties of the market based on heterogeneous groups with differing aims. All of these are not factored into economic models because they are fuzzy. The conclusion was that macroeconomics made a dire error in seeing itself as a closed system that can be mathematically derived from first principles, when in reality it is intertwined with FischerBlacks concept of noise at every step. The end result was economists make convenient assumptions untethered to market realities to make their models neat and reliable in terms of generating outputs. This came at the expense of predictive power. The first step to rehabilitating the discipline would be to focus on heuristics and concoct formulas from whatever rules of thumb have reliable predictive power. Anyways, it doesnt matter.

Reddit,2024-08-30,"You may well be right that NVDA has peaked. Youre certainly right that AI in general is overhyped. The main use case weve seen is that of a Reddit simulator, and the most popular Reddit posts are often at odds with reality themselves, so a flawed simulation is basically compounding GIGO. Regarding NVDA though, consider that its about 20x multiple on forecastable numbers, which maybe isnt that high. Next consider that the more growth, the higher a multiple that can be tolerated. Finally, consider if there is anyone who seems like a viable competitor? These three points create a thesis that NVDA might very well not be anywhere near having peaked.

He has very good knowledge of internal processes and how fast Intel can get bloated, its not the first time in this companys history. The bigger problem was once Pat came into play he was not focused on efficiency but solving the current issues with brute force. Meaning throwing as much money and people at it as possible. The issue that came into play that he slightly miscalculated how far Intel was actually behind. His famous philosophy back then was that by each generational cycle the competition came out Intel already offers 2. We can really see this in the current roadmap were Intel comes out with new products in way under 12 months in each space. When AMD and TSMC doesnt get their act together Intel will leapfrog them in 2025. This isnt the first time Intel has done this in its history. The issue now is that Intel is a long term play and in a currently not favorable position. Wall Street does not like that. They want fast money, fast quarterly results and dont care about anything else really. Now with the recent news about activist investors iam quite sure this news is fabricated by activist investors who manipulate the media in the background to gain shareholders favor. Dont fall for it. Intel wants to protect themselves from activist investors because they would try to split the company apart for the short term gain. If they would enter Intel is done. I really hope Pat will live long enough to see how what incredible work he has done. In 2025 we will see a very competitive Intel and in 2026 current Wallstreet critics will be very very silent.

Reddit,2024-08-27,"So Im going to take this a slightly different direction. Real Mistakes Intel has made 1. Looking into Holographic DUV rather than going all in on EUV. This is what caused them to lose their market position. This was the result of bean counters hoping the cheaper process would be good enough, but while it worked the yield rates were too low causing it to become uneconomically viable and forcing intel to not shrink their chips for multiple generations to maintain economic viability. 2. Some bugoversight causing 13th 14th gen chips to damage themselves slowly with overvoltage issues. They say they have it under control now with the new microcode update. Only time will tell if that is true. Mistakes INVESTORS are worried about that we dont know the outcome of yet 1. Massive investments into new fabs without a clear roadmap, clientele, etc who will use their contracting services. This makes their balance sheet look like shit and if they dont get some big clients this will be a gigantic waste of money. 2. Their mistakes and anticonsumer approaches are degrading a core customer base in the server sector. AMD is also going after the server market more aggressively. This puts their long term market position in jeopardy. 3. They are making a lot of long term bets on things like GPUs that are hemmoraging money. While I believe this is probably best for them in the long term investors want their money this quarter and these types of plays are just not what they want to see. Reasons to be optimistic 1. Their current chips have honestly caught up to AMD. The 14th gen that arent killing themselves match or exceed the top AMD chips in a wide variety of tasks. 7800X3D is overall best gaming GPU but after that there is a long list of great performance cpus from intel. 2. The 9000 series from AMD is overall a bit of a dud. VERY little benefit over the 7000 series which a large part of the 14th gen already was beating. The 7800X3D still best for consumers and while most of the benefits for the 9000 series is for servers and heavey multithreaded workloads the jump isnt particularly impressive and well below what we normally expect for a generational leap. If 15th generation even an average boost compared to 14th gen its VERY likely intel takes a clear lead in the market. My take. Intel is making multiple long term plays and people are getting super ancy because they have had 2 major mistakes in the last decade. These are really risky gambles with hundreds of billions of dollars and if even 1 of these turns out to be a complete failure it will be a huge issue for the company. By end of 2025 first service fabs will be online, battlemage gpus will be out, and we will know if 15th gen is better than 9000 series or if they also stumble like AMD on this generational update. Given the massive hits in their recent stock, there likely is a lot of upside potential IF they pull it off. The idea they are risk adverse to me doesnt really track with their current heavy investment strategy. The culture might be risk adverse but they are playing with fire here. Messing up and having another microcode issue is something they CANT afford. AMDs messups are giving them an opportunity to regain their footing and we wont know how this plays out until probably end of next year. I expect the stock to go down or stay put until we see how these bets pay off and any investment in INTEL is just betting on this stuff working out. Only project that has me super worried for them is the contract fabs. Its REALLY not clear who they would be getting contract work from. Unless they get an Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc style client I honestly DONT know how they can justify the cost and I just dont see any of those companies leaving TSMC in a serious capacity. There just arent many customers in the world that can even use this service and stealing them from TSMC wont be easy.",Positive,0,0.8513378500938416,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-23,"Financial highlights for Thor Explorations Ltd. for Q2 earnings report and H1 2024 Gold poured for the period totaled 21,742 oz. 23,588 ounces of gold sold in Q2 2024 with an average gold price of 2,309 per oz. Mill feed grade was 3.42 gtAu with recovery at 94.6. Cash operating cost of 585 per oz sold and allin sustaining cost AISC of 802 per oz sold. During the period, lower cost medium and highgrade stockpile with an average grade of 3.42 grams per tonne of gold gtAu was fed through the mill resulting in a lowerthanexpected cash operating cost and AISC. Q2 2024 revenue of 53.8 million Q2 2023 41.3 million and H1 2024 of 87.1 million H1 2023 81.7 million. Q2 2024 EBITDA of 37.6 million Q2 2023 25.6 million and H1 2024 of 60.9 million H1 2023 40.3 million. Q2 2024 net profit of 27.5 million Q2 2023 14.4 million and H1 2024 of 39.9 million H1 2023 17.4 million. The company paid a further 7.9 million towards its senior debt facility, leaving a balance of 6.5 million which is scheduled to be fully repaid by the end of the calendar year. Revised FY2024 production guidance of 90,000 oz for 2024 with a downward revised AISC guidance of 9001,000 per oz. If you want some exposure to gold without making it core to the portfolio with the potential for extreme upside, this is probably the best junior miner out there. With an AISC discount of 3060 below most mid and large miners, these are obscene profit margins that should continue until the end of the year.",Positive,1,0.975939154624939,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-23,"No, this does not make sense. The flaw is assuming that dividends now are relevant to your income at age 60 from dividends. All you are doing is incurring repeated taxable events for no reason as you say yourself, you do not need dividends today. Your goal today should be to grow your portfolio as much as possible suitable with your risk tolerance. When you are at the age where income matters to you, you can simply sell off your portfolio at the right rate or move it into dividend yielding assets. That way you dont repeatedly incur taxable events but end up at the same place more or less. If I invest in SPY which grows 10 a year in price 1 in dividends, I get 11 annualized. What youre doing is in sense investing in a strategy that grows say 9 a year in price 2 in dividends if were lucky. Both portfolios get to the same place, but one paid a lot more in taxes. And at the end of the day, you have the same cash pile pretaxes that you can now migrate to bonds or cash or high dividend paying companies, etc., as desired at that old age. Remember that dividends are not free. They come straight out of the companys assets. Its not like youre getting a gift for no reason that you dont get from nondividend paying companies. Think of it like company taking money from your right pocket and forcing you to move it to your left pocket, and then you immediately move it back to the right pocket. The notion of a building a strong base via dividendsshares doesnt actually make sense. Well it does, but you can do all that without dividends. Youre still invested in a growing company even if it there is no dividend. Your ownership in the company is still rising in value. There is still compounding.

Reddit,2024-08-23,"I use different criteria depending on sector and intention. For swing trades, I focus more on technical price movement, sector correlation and nearterm catalysts. For longterm holds its about valuations, market expectations versus actual performance, and contextual tailwinds e.g. macro environment in the next 10 years. Its also a hierarchical process depending on how long Im looking to invest. For longterm holds, I rely on these Return on assetsinvested capital. This is the most important factor when determining the protective moat a company has, while being a major contributor to net profit and FCF. It should be 15 minimum and growing 5 or more over the median 3year average. Obviously, we would want ROAROIC to be in the top quintile of the sector as well. Valuations in the lower fifth and fourth quintile relative to the entire market. Relative to sector, PEG takes precedence over simple PE and shares priority with MAPE MarginAdjusted PE. This is supported by the intrinsic notion of valuations beyond PEs face value how it reflects time preference of the investor pool1 and ancillary factors determining the price premiumdiscount. Debtequity, EVEBIDTA, PB, PNAV, etc. are all sectordependent e.g. PNAV is superior to PB for tankers due to the cyclical nature of the business and normalized leverage ratios. Proprietary assets or processes that grant lasting competitive advantage. Im very keen on this in the microcap space as its the main catalyst behind potential growth into midcap size. A harsh discrepancy between longterm market sentiment and the fundamental performance of the business. Exploiting this is the big ticket to making gains you will be able to establish a stake before the classic price feedback loop kicks in.

Reddit,2024-08-23,"Yes you got it. Growth means something rather particular, though in investing, growth and value refers to valuation, with expensive stocks called growth stocks and cheap stocks called value. The best analogy Your portfolio is a pie. Your goal is to make the pie as big as possible. Taking chunks of it today and putting it right back isnt increasing the size of your pie. Owning shares in a growing company is. When youre old, you can then sell chunks of your pie to finance your lifestyle with your winnings. We dont care what you did to get the pie big, just that it is big. For some reason, dividend investing has a bit of a cult around it that tends to attract a lot of younger investors.

Reddit,2024-08-16,The Yen is beginning to move up vs USDDXY on bad US economic news and moves down on good US economic news. We had a lot of good US news this week. Once JPow cuts interest rates the interest rate spread bw US bonds vs Japanese bonds narrows and the Yen should continue to appreciate vs USDDXY. The increase in the continuous US unemployment claims the 1st Friday in August was when the Yen started that big appreciation vs USDDXY and we had that Monday global market dump. The market was anticipating lower US interest rate cuts. The main reason the Yen dumped from 100 YenUSD in 2020 to 161 in 2024 is because US 10 yr was near 5 vs Japanese interest rates at 00.10. That makes borrowing in Yen cheaper than USD. Japanese bonds have increased to 0.50 while US interest rates are expected to be cut 0.250.5 to 4.504.75 whether you are in the 25 or 50 pt basis pt camp. The spread is narrowing which should weaken the USDDXY vs the Yen. Now I have no idea how many dollars are in this trade and will get squeezed. Maybe very few people and the markets reaction will be muted. But the Yen should move higher.,Neutral,0,0.7894439101219177,Reply

I think you had a period 23 years ago where people were getting out and making up for time they spent inside. Then you had a period where the pent up demand started to cool off and normalize and now it has continued to do so right into a period of concerns over the consumer, who seems increasingly cautious about spending on things like this. I dont know. I look at it and it feels like theres something there and its not just 100 a fad. At the same time, I dont think management seems all that great. So I think you had something that maybe overearned for a while, normalized and is now facing further concerns as people worry about discretionary spending. I dont think its a fad, its an interesting concept but perhaps a time period during covid gave people unrealistic expectations about normal demand? Management seems soso and the fact that they are already talking about giving up on it isnt exactly encouraging.

How can you not love this In 1995, Beck became a toolanddiemaker apprentice at Fisher Paykel company. While working there, he taught himself and used the company workshop to experiment with rockets and propellants. Using these tools and materials, he created a rocket bike, rocketattached scooter, and a jet pack. Later, Beck moved into product design department and bought a cruise missile engine from the United States. It was while he was working at Fisher and Paykel he met his wife, Kerryn Morris, also a designer. He then worked in New Plymouth as a project engineer on a yacht. Also they are really smart with their capital. When Virgin when bankrupt, Rocket Lab was able to buy a lot from them.

Reddit,2024-08-09,"The Yen was weaker than USD and other currencies in part because the BOJ didnt hike rates with inflation like most other CBs. The put pressure on the Yen and it devalued from 100 Yen 1 USD to 161 Yen 1USD from 20202024. 2 weeks ago the BOJ raised the interest rates from 0.10 to 0.25. While 0.25 seems low, the rate of increase is a 2x while other CBs are already cutting interest rates. This is why the Yen can be a recession trade. Because the spread bw US 10 year interest rates and the Japanese 10 yr interest rates narrows as the Fed cuts US rates putting tailwinds behind the Yen for appreciation against USD. My take is the Yen was always due to appreciate against the USD once the Fed signaled interest rate cuts. The surprise BOJ interest rate hike just added a little gasoline to the Yen appreciation trade. Of course all these degenerative gamblers taking out Japanese Yen loans using USD to buy US Treasuries and Tech stocks got caught with their pants down and are forced to sell some assets to cover their increased borrowing costs. As they sell US Treasuries, tech stocks, and other assets to buy Japanese Yen to cover their increase borrowing costs, this becomes a doom loop as the Yen moves higher and the assets they sell move lower. The Yen carry trade unwind isnt close to being unwound yet. Their will be more forced margin call liquidations of assets to cover these loans as the Japanese Yen continues to appreciate vs USD. Now the question is the speed of this Yen carry trade unwind. If it is slow move higher in the Yen, than NO financial markets wont blow up. If the Yen appreciated by 10 Yen per day against the USD as it did Monday, than yeah the markets could blowup.",Neutral,0,0.5245394110679626,Reply

The market is speculatively taking that ROA increase and assuming the multiple 67x YoY will be replicated over time instead of the raw delta.

Reddit,2024-08-09,"You dont see it when you look at the revenue, but UpWorks growth has been declining and pretty much has come to a halt. Gross services volume is basically the same as it was a year ago. Revenue is only up because they keep increasing the take rate. 19 of what the clients pay now goes to UpWork. Their revenue guidance for Q3 is less than what they made in Q2. So they might enter a phase of negative growth now. Caused by declining usage which cannot be offset by further increasing the take rate. They keep focussing on enterprise deals and neglect the marketplace experience. Although the marketplace is the 6x bigger business. Clients who use the marketplace still get 3 ! invoices and receipts per week ! even if they just work with one freelancer. Who wouldnt want to add 19 to their freelancer cost and the hassle to add 12 documents per month to their tax paperwork? TlDr They focus on their sales team, neglect the product, make it more and more expensive, usage growth declines. They still have a great starting point as the market leader in work marketplaces. But unless they change the approach, I think nothing will come out of it.

Average spent per buyer is 4x smaller on Fiverr compared to UpWork. When you commission a onetime job like a logo, it doesnt matter if you pay 100 or 130. That wont make you take the job off the platform. But when you work with a freelancer on a constant basis, you start to think about why you pay UpWork every month too.

Reddit,2024-08-09,"So the numbers tell a clear story, right? Usage growth has died down to zero. As seen in gross services volume and active users. And with the guidance of 6 revenue for Q3, it stands to be expected that usage will start shrinking now. Despite over a hundred million Dollars spent on sales and marketing per year. My interpretation UpWorks service is good at the beginning of the user journey. To match buyers and sellers. But then it becomes a chore. Because of the weekly invoice cycle and the separate invoicing from sellers and UpWork. That makes it an 8x worse solution than direct seller to buyer invoices. UpWork gained a massive amount of users during covid. And now those users abandon the service. Its a long way down to precovid levels. It can make the business decline for years. On the upside, UpWork might have the potential to become as big as the other market place leaders. Amazon, Uber, Booking, AirBnB, Shopify etc are all orders of magnitude larger than UpWork and I dont see a reason the leading work market place shouldnt become as big as those.

So, the larger the contract, the lower the fee UpWork takes. The new structure is a flat 10 fee for all.

Still, the 6 active clients YoY look kinda good, so if those would be the only numbers we have QoQ and YoY, I would say I dont know what to think. Lets wait until next quarter.

As Ive learned more though, Ive read a lot of criticisms of QQQ ETFs and many of them revolve around investing in a stock exchange instead of an index. Obviously, Nasdaq is the top stock exchange in the world right in terms of growth and investing in it sounds like youd get great returns. But something doesnt feel right about investing in a stock exchange itself. Like, what if in a decade a new stock exchange over takes the Nasdaq and all the major companies move to that exchange? Would all the QQQ ETFs just drop and be worthless?

Reddit,2024-08-02,"The Yen has always had lower interest rates than the other major currencies. It was negative forever. So traders would take out loans in Yen with other currencies such as the USD, Euro, rtc and buy other assets that are appreciating such as gold, us treasuries, commodities, and stocks. BOJ raised the interest rate of the Yen to 0.25 this week to support the Yen. Now all of those traders borrowing Yen have their borrowing costs raised at the same time US 10 yr and Euro interest rates are bring cut. Thats the idea in a nutshell. Think of it is a short squeeze. I would like to say I saw this happen, but I bought the Yen at 161 just because I was looking at the 25 year chart vs USD. I wasnt expecting to be up 8 on that trade in a month.

Reddit,2024-08-02,"The past few years the yen has been getting artificially weakened v the usd due to japanese yield curve control running up against useuetc tightening.

They borrowed in weakening yen at super low rates then went risk on with that yen, mostly in tech and the SP. It kept credit liquidity high while rates everywhere else were rising. It was part of why buffett went heavy into Japanese banks last year. Now that boj is reversing that and the yen is strengthening while their rates rise, all those bull bets have been unwinding. Boj see inflation rising and theyre acting to counter it while the rest of the world is in the middle of loosening so were seeing a drastic reversal and a strengthening yen.

I am 100 owner I deposit 100k into an LLC account and the LLC borrows 400k to buy a 500k property Things go well , I rent it out and I have some positive cash flow after taxes, insurance utilities, and loan payments after some period of time Now my LLC has 100k cash and lets say I think I only need a 50k cushion so I have some excess cash. of 50k inside my LLC. Now I could do some things here 1. I could use the excess cash to pay down my mortgage , Not now I have more equity ownership but I have less cash , I owe 50k less on the loan, but now I have 50k less cash. No magic way to create value here, my assets go down by 50k because I have 50k less cash, but my liabilities go down by 50 because now I owe 50k less. 2. I could upgrade my property , buy new efficient heat pumps or maybe better more efficient water heaters, or install solar panels , or replace the roof if it needs it, or just try to make it nicer so I can justify higher rent, in theory this should increase the property value . Again the property should increase in value, but once again I now I also have 50k less cash . Now there is a risk here, I could spend 50k on some solar panels , maybe they just dont work well, they produce little energy , they look ugly and its basically a 50k loss, or more because I have these ugly panels on my place that do nothing . Or maybe they work great, and not only do they look great I can now advertise my property as green hey it has its own solar panels , and not only does it increase my property value by 50k or more, but now because my property is green I can demand higher rent because hey I am green , and people like green stuff. So while my bank has 50k less, my equity is 70k more, and I can also raise my rent and people will pay a premium because they like the idea of a green property 3. I could take a distributiondividend and move money out of my LLC what will decrease the value of the LLC because now its not holding 50k cash, but now I personally am 50k richer. Since I own 100 of LLC my net worth does not change My LLC bank account has 50k , my personal bank account is 50, but since I own both bank accounts nothing has really changed.

Reddit,2024-10-18,"Remember that throughout history, dividends were a given. The dividend yield of the SP500 was never below 3 until around this century, and often much higher. And one of the classic ways of valuing a company was to calculate how much dividend could be expected from it, in fact, that was really the whole point of owning shares of a stock. Only in recent times, mainly due to the rise of tech companies, do we not only not expect a dividend, but we shun them. Whether this trend is here to stay or is temporary remains to be seen. Is it a shift in the way businesses are run or is it recency bias? A lot of investors correctly observe that growth stocks have trounced dividend stocks, and they are correct that it is total return that matters, not income. But what is less certain is what is going to be the best way of achieving those high total returns in the future. I also think that the issue of tax drag is overblown. Yes, more taxes mean less returns, yet it is often not mentioned that tax you pay on dividends is included in your cost basis if the dividends are reinvested. In other words, by paying today, you will pay less when you sell your investment. Whether this is good or bad depends on your situation. Its exactly the same type of analysis as choosing to invest in a Roth or traditional IRA. Do you pay the tax now or later? Obviously paying now has benefit for a lot of people, otherwise Roths wouldnt be popular. For me, paying 15 on dividends now vs 12 or more later isnt a huge problem. Currently, because valuations are so high, Im putting in new money outside of IRAs into dividend funds only because I think it will outperform in the future, I will enjoy the income in retirement, and I feel it is better than a value fund because the quality of companies are better.",Neutral,0,0.9011895060539246,Reply

Stock buybacks is typically done on an adhoc basis, so there is no expectation of when or if that might occur. Dividends are typically declared ahead of the time, and while not a promise, is at least a statement of intent that there will be regular return of income to the investors. For companies in the growth phase, buybacks would be superior because they give the company more flexibility. But for companies in the cash cow phase, investors might prefer the promise from management that a portion of the profits will be paid out. And one other benefit of dividends that I didnt touch on psychology. Investors, particularly retail investors, dont like to sell stocks during a downturn.

So, a dividend is in effect a statement by management that they believe the company can perform and continue to deliver into the future. Boeing is a case study. Prior to 1998 investment in new aircraft programs and the companys reputation was seen as a way to protect investors, and the dividend, well into the future.

Assumptions like management will always spend money in good faith to maximize earnings are useful if you want to make a world that is spreadsheetcompatible, but massively off the mark from the real world. In the real world management has incentives like getting the stock price to a certain number by a certain time to get a payout, future be damned. Creating unrealistic narratives about future earning to justify or increase PE ratios you know are excessive. Tech is a huge part of the SP500 and these problems are very common in tech. Around the dotcom crash this all got so bad that nobody could give out any dividends at all, for fear of demonstrating that they dont have endless golden geese lined up that the money would be better spent on. These days theyve gotten a little better about this and your Apple, Microsoft, and Google at least pay out a nominal dividend of like 0.51. Investors regularly get their money pissed up the wall like this in tech, when they would have been much better off just receiving it as a dividend than having tens of billions wasted on the metaverse with promises that all life would revolve around this concept in a few years, only to have them say actually never mind its all fake after a few years of stock options vesting at high valuations. Of course, were in the middle of a similar bubble with AI, so this all seems quaint now, but trust me, in a few years there will be a lot of people saying I wish they had just given me the money. So yeah, I like a small dividend, just to maintain a culture that this is my money they are playing with, and if they dont have a good use for it then Ill take it.

During your accumulation phase you would be wrong to have any allocation other than a diversified portfolio that is spread between growth and value with some adjustment for whether we are in a Value or a Growth phase in the market.

In the late accumulation phase you start to build in a strategy for up and down markets as you now have some principal to protect. In the Preretirement stage you start to worry more about beta and less about alpha particularly if you have done a good job of accumulation. In Retirement your goals are preservation and income, so less beta is more important than excess alpha unless you are late to the party.

Reddit,2024-10-05,"Correct. The most common way a lender will look at the quantum of debt they are willing to extend is a multiple on cash flow.

The primary reason being is a company will trade at some much higher multiple say 7 to 20 times depending on business so if youre only lent 3 to 4, you are safely inside a potential EV of the company. Secondarily, the lender wants to ensure you generate enough cash flow to cover the interest expense of the debt.

I would prefer to not toss a bunch more money into the market until I understand what that something is. Personally I think the economy will be fine, but things are in a major rotation and its having all kinds of impacts. The primary driver is the change in work habits for a large segment of the population. WFH is great for them. Its great for society as a whole perhaps, but its terrible for a slew of business models. Retail and restaurants near office buildings and along major commuter routes were priced in with commuters in mind. Less commuters is pinching those businesses hard. I saw Verizon is suffering and laying off a bunch of people. Im not surprised. A lot of people are now WFH. That means they use wifi more than the cell towers for a lot of their work.

Rate cut of 25 basis points already built into prices, and pretty much emotion too. Likely little affect. Look at other signals, e.g. inflation, unemployment, and invest for a longer term. If only 25 points, then the fed thinks it will be a soft landing, and everyone is expecting even with that a rebound both because of fundamentals and the 4th quarterelection history. Depending on the landing, real estate should do well beyond the soft landing. Other interest rate sensitive investments likely to do better as we land, but be ready to rotate back into growth if thats your objective.

Reddit,2024-08-21,"I think you need to understand a more fundamental thing. Two things, in fact. When it comes to crypto there is absolutely no reason for anyone, ever, to hold your money. As soon as your money is out of your wallet they can just take it. There is no technical method, and mostly no legal method, to get it back. Crypto is the scam capital of 2024. If this is what happened to you assuming whatever company you did this with was not legit and this isnt just the normal stupidity of such companies, learn the lesson and move on. Investment is about purchasing an asset that increases in value. In this sense crypto isnt an investment its appreciation in value isnt based on anything tangible but rather on hopes and dreams and, occasionally, scams. When you purchase securities as opposed to crypto, you also do so at your own risk, but you also know what that risk is, what the rules of the game are, and, more importantly, there is a clear logic and the legal framework in place. Companies and governments need cash companies need it to fund growth and governments need it to bridge over their own stupidity and to fund projects. This is financing the investor money, through stocks, bonds which are loans enables them to execute their projects and produce growths, and with growth there are returns. That is to say, financing is a necessary funding source for organizations and your benefit comes from financing them. Most people who are not involved in running a business first hand do not understand the fact that major expansion of a business without an additional funding that comes from outside the business is between improbable and impossible. This is why investing has to exist. Crypto, on the other hand, is only useful to buy or fund things the government doesnt want you to fund or buy, or running scams on unsuspecting and inexperienced people. Its not subject to any predictable rules and it is in many senses worse than casino gambling. In every casino game there are specific mathematical properties that can tell you the odds.

The value of your crypto portfolio depends entirely on future enhancement of its acceptance, which you purport to think is a function of its image, as opposed to its utility.

Reddit,2024-08-04,"Youre not looking at what small caps had gains and why. It was all mostly concentrated in regional banks due to the bond yield curve inversion. Short term yields going down long term staying the same. So the question is will regional banks continue to rise due to the inversion and probably yes in the short term due to rate cuts and predicted rate cuts but look at the warning signs all the big banks are sucking because theyre stowing away cash reserves for future credit defaults. Whats that say it looks like were going to get a spike up again and a drop down by the beginning of next year. Looking at IWM chart if the price can get back over 230 its likely to got to 260270, however if recession, war etc fear takes hold then itll retreat below 200 probably close to 160 area.

I always believed that small caps would outperform large caps over the long term because you are taking on more risk, thus you should get a higher return for taking on more risk. I also understand that in todays business environment, large caps, especially in the tech sector, have many benefits over small players.

Reddit,2024-08-04,"I think stocks are very overpriced right now, so Im slowly selling off my index funds and looking for individual value stock opportunities. Theres an amazing small cap opportunity I recently found Aduro Clean Tech ACTHF. Not available on Robinhood, you need a brokerage that can buy Canadian OTC stock. They have nextgen plastic recycling tech thats at least twice as good as their competitors. They have achieved 95 yield for plastic types that were previously considered nonrecyclable. There is about 400 billion USD to be made per year from recycling those plastic types, and that 400 billion market is untapped until companies start commercializing their process. Aduro has several different processes for different tiers of plastic recycling difficulty that will be commercialized over the next 1 to 5 years, so this is a great longterm hold with many upcoming catalysts as they establish partners and commercialize new processes. They are currently listed on Canadian OTC market, but they have announced an IPO at NYSE. Once they are listed on NYSE, institutional investors will begin buying institutions dont buy OTC stocks, and Robinhood will gain access to the stock so more individuals will begin buying. We have a few months to accumulate ACTHF before the NYSE IPO. Buying preNYSE IPO will mean guaranteed massive gains for this stock.

Expect big drops of 20 in mid cap stocks and even more in small caps. Within a week. This happens also for the upside like we see this month for a lot of the U equities. That said, there is unbelievable valuation and immense upside to many uranium juniors and business focused on the fuel cycle enrichment etc. This sector moves at a glacial speed, and many stocks do get ahead of themselves. Do lots of homework on companies that are developers of mines. The only producers that need to be considered for a newbie is Cameco, Uranium energy Corp, boss energy and energy fuels. If you want more then look at Sprotts Uranium information on their website. Dont listen to hype on YouTube, X, and other sources. Its a great opportunity to buy a non fungible, scarce and undervalued commodity, but dont expect to make life changing money if you consider yourself an average investor, much of the easy money has been made already in the sitting and waiting. Now is the time to look for value, performance and the companies that are actually going to be able to mine this resources at significant quantities well into the future.

Kazakhstans recent production cuts and the U.S. banning Russianenriched uranium are only going to add more pressure to an already constrained market. On top of that, demand for uranium is expected to grow as China and other nations continue to build nuclear reactors. Prices have been fluctuating, but many experts believe they will rise again due to these supply and demand dynamics. Whats also interesting is how big tech companies are now getting involved. Microsoft recently signed a deal to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power its data centers, while Oracle is building small modular reactors SMRs to fuel its AI data centers.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"Still waiting for liquid fluoride thorium reactor LFTR to come online. These can convert Thorium232 into Thorium233. This decays into Protactinium233, which further decays into Uranium233. Protactinium233 can be removed from the liquid salt of a tworegion MSR by reductive extraction into liquid bismuth. Basically a breeder reactor that uses a cheaper and more abundant fuel source. This style of reactor was designed in the 1950s and I honestly believe the main reason this hasnt been developed further is more due to proliferation risks than cost or feasibility. Since the Protactinium233 can be extracted rather easily and would be of high concentration, it would reduce a lot of the work needed to make a nuclear weapon. Mainly removal of neutron emitters and other purification steps to get to 95 purity of Uranium233. Uranium233 is a fissile isotope.",Neutral,0,0.9932193160057068,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-16,"How much is the demand actually though? Sure theres a nuclear renaissance currently ongoing but micro reactors are micro e.g. small meaning less required fuel and many are far from being deployed in the coming years. If mines are actually going to reopen then its more than reasonable to assume that theyll open in time before demand surges. Also historically the price of uranium varies between 20120 and this isnt the first time weve had a nuclear renaissance. Realistically, we have near infinite uranium on earth.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"TL,DR from ChatGPT Summary Uranium Market Report Price Trends Since 2020, uranium prices have surged from 21lb to 106lb in February 2024, currently stabilizing at 83lb. The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected. Uranium Overview Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U238 used in military applications and U235 used to fuel nuclear reactors. U235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal. HALEU and Enrichment Highassay lowenriched uranium HALEU is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives. Supply Challenges Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 1015 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30 by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap. Demand Growth The U.S., China, and France account for 58 of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28 increase in demand from 20232030 and a 51 rise from 20312040, driven by global clean energy goals. Global Production Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43 of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward selfreliance. Investment Insights The report suggests that mining companies are wellpositioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector. Conclusion The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uraniums role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"no because unlike with other forms of fuel, uranium costs are a tiny portion of the overall cost of building and operating a reactor. the majority of the cost is the upfront capex for building the reactor 10s of billions for big multireactor plants. then, the marginal cost of loading them with reactor is almost negligible in comparison. due to how expensive reactors are to build, countries cant afford to let then sit idle regardless of uranium prices. It was calculated that 700lbs is the cutoff at which point it becomes uneconomical to keep running the reactors. this is 8x the current price. due to these factors, uranium supply is priceinelastic",Neutral,0,0.951222836971283,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-16,Its not about disagreeing. Its about being a better solution. Even in the winter solar just wont even generate enough energy nor will wind. And if we create enough windmills to have enough energy in the winter then theyll be sitting on their arses whole summer. It is not a solution for baseline energy it is a complementary solution to the baseline. Then you fill in with renewables and batteries which can also charge from overproduction of a nuclear facility. Furthermore I think energy production should be more decentralized which reduces the scale of some energy plants and makes it more cost effective. See SMR which china is already starting production of. If we can streamline and make the production of it more efficient itll probably even cost less money than all other energy sources.,Positive,1,0.9504442811012268,Reply

The wargames pose a possibility for incidents, insofar they could weight then stock down a bit. But i wouldnt be worried too much in the short term. China wont be ready to do anything stupid until probably 2027. Further, there are only two windows in which the waters of the taiwan straight are suitablenfor a maritime invasion one is in spring and the other in october. But the later one is closing rapidly. And though an invasion is unlikely to be the next step of escalation, the thread of an invasion needs to be present with every step of escalation. Because of this, id see the wargames as provocation, but not as an escalation of the conflict. Therefore I think that it ll only have a very limited effect in the short term.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Yeah, definitely not a bad call out, but I think as it is with most value plays, you have to look at things that arent going to be in earnings reports or at least account for the lag time. Theyve been cutting costs, sold their HQ for 50m which hasnt shown on a Quarterly report yet. That will also reduce spend in the future. This will also be the first quarter in which the added revenue from the Overstock dot com relaunch will be included. Youre right, they definitely arent out of the woods yet. A lot of work to do. But from how it looks to me, not even the potential for a turnaround is priced in as of now. Their EPS is negative so PE is null, but the price to sales ratio is like 0.3 now.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Selling the coin collection to be able to feed myself and the cat. Kidding. Its not that bad...yet. Theres honestly a lot to go over. If youre really interested in the companyplay it wouldnt be a bad idea to listen throughwatch the investor conference they had along with this earnings. Im tentatively bullish on the company still. I think Lemonis has a lot of good ideas and has reformed after giving too many overly optimistic projections. He seems to be making much more conservative promises. I think having physical towel stores again is going to be a great thing for the company, letting people out in the world know that the brand still exists. Lemonis bought 1.5m in shares after the earnings reportthe stock tanking, which was by far his largest buyin to date. That unfortunately for me did absolutely nothing to move the stock up. I think the market is waiting for tangible results before theyre going to reprice. Shorts are probably still hoping for the bankruptcy. There was a lot of other bullish news before and after earnings, and again, none of that did anything to positively impact the price of the stock. That said, I think the stock is still highly undervalued even for the current situation. The company has a good balance sheet and other valuable assets. If you take the market cap and subtract their assets then the market is essentially valuing the company at 0. Lmk if you have any other questions though. Happy to chat despite the pain this has caused me. Edit I do also still have a very small position on. Calls for next June and Jan 2026.

Reddit,2024-10-11,"Some minor details in need of correctionclarification. Radar and lidar are also capable of detecting and classifying pedestrians either by themselves or as part of a multimodal sensor suite. In fact they can be better than cameras in some circumstances, low light as you mentioned. Some lidars also give Dopplerrelative speed not sure if Waymos does but I know AURs does. Video processing is necessarily a much more resource intensive task than processing lidar or radar data. Now everyone I know that has radar and lidar also has cameras, so that may not be important but there are probably some optimizations that having multiple sensors allows a reduction in the amount of video that needs to be processed. Rapid iteration is not a differentiator, everyone doing self driving Waymo included can push updates whenever they want. Most also use Continuous integration pipelines. Regulatory hurdles are mostly propagandafake news auto companies self certify for safety, other than FMVSS rules which are testable requirements NHTSA can verify. FMVSS rules are very easy to comply with and say nothing about autonomy. There are some FMVSS changes required to remove steering wheel pedals and other things but those changes have been in process for years and should be done soon if it hasnt already happened, not familiar with the latest status. The easy work around is to simply not delete these until the rules change, theres also a waiver process that some companies I believe have successfully completed to delete these components. The real regulatory hurdle is liability, and needing to pay out millions in damages when a court determines your product killed someone and the manufacturer is liable.

It doesnt mean going against the crowd is always a winning strategy, but if you just follow what every retail trader is doing, you wont get great returns. For those looking to play it safe, ETFs like the SP 500, QQQ, or MSCI World make a lot of sense and can provide decent returns. When I think about the next 10 years, Im not too sure what will happen. Im more focused on the next 13 years. Sure, you can jump on the NVIDIA train and the whole AI hype, but while AI is a hot topic right now, weve seen four waves of AI before, each bringing new revolutionary advancements. Im skeptical about how smart these LLMs really are, and there are many other forms of AI that have potential too. Additionally, NVIDIAs valuation is influenced by factors like demand for gaming GPUs, data center growth, and the overall semiconductor market trends. However, with a 3 trillion market cap, Im curious to see if they can maintain that level. It seems heavily tied to momentum and hype, and we all know hype can fizzle out. If youre looking to play it safe over the next year, maybe consider investing in a few broad and diversified ETFs, and perhaps look into some China and India indexes, too.

Its starting to feel like the Dotcom bubble, but this time with AI. Honestly, outside of a few specific uses, AI is kind of useless in its current state and nowhere near as smart as people think. With the massive investments going into AI, the returns needed to justify them are just unrealistic. Sure, in the short term, the AI boom might keep pushing tech stocks and the market up, but once the returns dont materialize fast enough, the bubble is going to pop. Im not saying AI is a total flop, but were not there yet, and the market is way too impatient. Meanwhile, Intel is in a much better spot strategically. Theyre still super important for the U.S., consumer PCs, and cloud computing, and theres still huge demand for energyefficient chips. Over the next two years, I think Intel will outperform NVIDIA by a lot.",Positive,1,0.4434753358364105,Reply

Some small company, which wants to do AI, would rather pay extra 10k for nvidia hardware, than buy gaugi and wont have any developers capable to do anything with it. So the only hope for intel to get into ai race are software giants like Msft, who have resources to invest into development of the needed software for gaugi.

Intel has shed most of their adjacent vertical business units, while still failing consistently with their core product. The only product with a promising trajectory is their GPU business, and that product is still lightyears behind Nvidia and AMD and probably wont see any kind of meaningful returns for a decade, if they manage to catch up at all AND manage to capture any portion of the market.

Reddit,2024-10-04,Intel has a shit ton of debt thats all coming due this year that has to be refinanced you never mention that you never looked in that because youre not looking at the root of the problems also gelsinger is a total fucking failure. He made wrong choices for a series of years paid himself an excess of 100 million dollars for nonperformance. And now the company throws out ideas of potentially divesting and selling off parts which was more done tactfully to get people talking well the some of the parts are worth more than the whole company. And you have a failure like was running Starbucks gets thrown out they bring in a turnaround expert in the stock pops thats why Intel got the attention but what if they throw gelsinger out what if they get somebody new what if they sell the company and parts. Text you have Intel whos 100 woke dei gets all this money from the government. Are you aware of the requirements for building the Fab facility in California? I would say youre not because they have so many requirements for what the composition of the workforce must be and its not white. Employment practices are based off of identification so they have to base hiring for the construction of these fat facilities based off of how people identify themselves so if you say yeah Im a guy nope Im a girl nope those quotas are filled we need others.. it also has to be 51 women workers building last time Ive been to job sites I dont see 51 women swinging a hammer putting in rivets and iron worker. So this Fab facility thats courtesy of the taxpayer money cuz the governments betting on winning and losers we know how that always turns out just look at solyndra with Obama and every other company that he put billions of dollars in as kickbacks and payoffs to his friends oh yeah Ill save you the trouble they all went to zero their bankrupt.. so these fat facilities best case scenario are not going to be up and running until 2029. Wall Street doesnt wait around 4 years number one number two theyre not going to get it done by 2029 because nothing is ever done on time it always takes longer so youre probably talking Midway 29 or 2030 before theyre up and running and starting to generate dollar one in revenue thats a long time from today. Their balance of their business the chip business they missed the boat they went the wrong direction they zigged when they should have zagged. If I owned Intel and I dont think God I would be selling cover calls against it every week a dollar or so higher than the current price to try to generate a return on the investment. If I wanted to buy and tell and I dont I would be selling puts a dollar or so below the current market and collecting the premium for a very short period weekly basis at the stock falls and closes below that strike you get put the stock you on it but you collected the premium and then Id start selling calls against it the following week. I think this approach of selling calls is going to generate a far greater return then the oscillations and gyrations of the stock relative to broader market conditions within the sector,Neutral,0,0.9679843485355377,Reply

GOOG AMZN Regarding their financials, they have over 100M in cash and their burn rate is very low. This is obviously a speculative play in which the company has to prove they are able to deliver in the data center business and strike 2B deals for their SMRs. If they can the stock can easily 10x, if they cant, right now the stock is overvalued by 5060.

Reddit,2024-09-27,"As of September 2024, the West continues to impose heavy sanctions and restrictions on imports of many Russian goods, particularly in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, some Western countries still import specific Russian products, though in significantly reduced volumes compared to pre2022 levels. Key imports that continue to flow from Russia to Europe and the U.S. include 1. Energy Products Although many European countries have drastically cut their dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, certain imports like liquefied natural gas LNG still persist, albeit at reduced levels. 2. Metals Russian aluminum and derivative products are still imported, though the U.S. imposes a 200 tariff on aluminum and derivative products smelted or cast in Russia, and similar measures are applied to steel and other metals. 3. NonEnergy Commodities Certain agricultural products like fertilizers continue to be imported into Europe due to their critical role in food production. Overall, the proportion of Russian goods imported by the West has significantly decreased due to sanctions, tariffs, and a broader pivot away from reliance on Russian supply chains. The most prominent exceptions are energy and select raw materials, often subject to very high tariffs or specific exclusions. Admiteddly, severed all ties is a bit excessive, severed most of them is more accurate.",Negative,-1,0.9263662695884705,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-24,"Its all about that quarterly gain, fire all the staff you can to show how much money you made on the books, then raise the prices so the companies that cant afford to jump ship in a short time span will have to pony up, so that quarter has profits, then you get your bonus as a Csuite executive, then you bail out to the next company with a good looking resume, mean while you leave a company to burn in ruin behind you not giving an absolute fuck. These companies are so fucking stupid, they should have contact clauses that state that bonuss and stock payouts are not to be paid until 4 years postdeparture if the company doesnt continue its upward path or the stock maintain a certain value. Its like the entire incentive for these asshole CSuite execs is to come in, cut everywhere, then high tail out. Its so stupid. I worked a job early in my career and got to see a contract for a CEODirector and granted he was only making 160kyear... and to me at the time making 45kyear in middle America I was like If I made 160kyear I would be happy for life Anyway, he showed me what his employment contract looked like as a Director because we talked about life at that level and how I wanted to be there and all. So in his offer letter, it basically stated, in plain English, that at any point from day 1 of him coming onboard, that if he didnt like the job, or the board didnt like him, he could quit or they could let him go, and they would have to write him a check equivalent to 1 years salary with taxes accounted for, meaning he would get to take home an actual 160k, so the actual check would need to be for a bit more accounting for his tax bracket and all... So I remember asking, I said something like... wait wait wait.... so when you reach this level, you can just start this job knowing if it doesnt work out 1 day, 5 days, 4 months down the road, at any point, not only are you making a fat salary, but the day you leave you just got a years salary ahead of time coming at you ready to go fuck all to go find the next thing? Meanwhile over here the rest of us are like heres my two weeks notice you want from me if I leave and if you dont want me, you just kick my ass out the door and fight me tooth and nail on unemployment that you pay for anyway by law? This shit is so fucked up, even more so that it was a notforprofit company. So, seeing his simpleton contract, made me believe that for profit companies have probably way more involved and lucrative contracts in them to entice CEOs onboard. While Im not saying as a CEO youd wanna just jump from company to company working 1 day and taking your 1 years pay, because then nobody would hire you. But imagine just being at that level where, no matter how bad you do, and lets be honest, at this level theres no BAD you can do because all the blame rolls down hill at this point, you just get to collect your millions, get lauded as a hero, then some other startup or some shit wants to hire you, they throw another contract at you and the cycle starts again. You come in, they say hey we will pay you this 300k a year base salary, heres a bunch of stock options, you can cash these out after 2 years and these out at 5 years, then the rest whenever you feel, along the way, if the stock goes up 2 points or whatever we give you X more shares and you can cash those out as you please... that shit adds up. Not to mention company bonus. We all know those numbers can be fucked around anyway you see fit. Accounting can make a company seem profitable and a CEO look good or bad even when a company makes no actual profit at all. Just look at the banks during the 2008 crisis and they got all those Bailouts by the government and then they gave themselves all those bonus like they did a good job.

Reddit,2024-09-09,"Interesting perspective. I would add two dimensions, if I may 1. With private equity, institutional investors often get a say when it comes to business decisions. They can shift their risk management from their portfolio to the asset itself. So there is less exposure to bad management or even fraud, at least in theory. 2. Given the recent boom in retail and the emergence of the neobrokers and analysts, the competition has shifted. The market will reward actors who provide the best information to their customers make them lose less money. Now, institutional investors now compete against other ,rational actors rather than ,irrational retail in this regard.

Reddit,2024-08-29,Theres a much simpler reason to be short on Nvidia. The market assumes Nvidia revenue will continue to rise but Nvidia already is already using up the all the chip production capacity they can get their hands on. Building a new fab to produce cutting edge chips takes like at least 10 years so the only way for Nvidia to increase revenue is to increase their profit margins on every gpu sold. Thats not really feasible though since AI companies need so many gpus for their next gen 100 quadrillion neuron AIs that an even higher profit margin for Nvidia would make the cost completely impossible for anyone to afford.,Positive,1,0.9999959468841553,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-29,Positions or not....you will be brown towning your pants if China doest lift its export control of gallium nitrate used for the production of semi conductors China has something close to 99 of the global supply of this stuff and they aint giving it to no one since daddy biden said no a.i chips for China. The bad news...the next biggest reserves of this stuff is in Ukraine. A literal war zone The canada which I cant see being cool with becoming an open cast mine for Americas computer chips. The really bad news...if the export controls stay in place we are gonna have a gpu shortage that made 2021 look abundant and tram green is gonna whack prices up on every gpu And if the ban is lifted it will be reciprocal wit the usa and mean China can eat as many chips as they want. At that point forget about the moon...jensen and the stock is gonna blast of in his leather jacket to Jupiter.

Reddit,2024-08-28,"Okay full reply. Seems like you have some level of both emotional investment in this and a fairly specific viewpoint, likely from an engineering perspective. That or you just read the grizzly report and believed it I dunno. Bad Product...1000lbs heavier than Joby Its true midnight is heavier, but Id need more information to understand why this would strictly rule out competition with Joby. The Midnight airframe is very specifically targeted at slightly shorter operational routes and urban air taxi service compared to Jobys design. Additional weight could be for stability, passenger features, or the use of cheaper OEM parts instead of custom design. They have not demonstrated full flight. the video here pretty conclusively demonstrates a full size Midnight airframe flying. I would like more information about, specifically, the Flight Data Im aware Joby published data about noise in conjunction with NASA, but Im not sure if thats specifically what youre referencing here? Additionally, USAF took delivery of a functional full size Midnight airframe I am assuming that they would not take on a full size vaporware. Founders are business leaders vs technocrats Gonna be honest here, my entire OP is about why this isnt a bad thing, more on this in the next point. using too many vendors and integrating them is a huge problem. This is how the entire aerospace industry works, not a huge problem. Archer is able to source from so many companies because those companies exist as suppliers to aerospace companies already. this article covers the divergent strategies between ACHR and JOBY in depth Of note But when it comes to their specific manufacturing strategies, the two companies have staked out sharply different paths Joby is vertically integrated and largely develops its components and systems inhouse, while Archer is pursuing a more traditional model by relying on a roster of Tier 1 legacy aerospace suppliers. The article goes on to quote Adam Goldstein specifically saying that they are aware that an IKEA aircraft as you call it is an 80 solution but provides a significantly superior market entry point. Uber Elevates engineer is even quoted as speculating that Joby will eventually divest from its full vertical integration. nbsp Again, this point and both ACHRs quotes and the note that no aerospace company comes close to the level of vertical integration Joby is pursuing is exactly what my post is about ACHRs path to revenue is WAY more clean than Jobys Stellantis investment is all shares I cover this in my OP. ACHR has far fewer outstanding shares than Joby even after considering a 400m issuance to Stellantis through 2030. Their plant is going to stay idle for a long time Why? Even if theyre not fully certified when the plant becomes operational, ramping up will take time and they have a global orderbook including shipping to international customers which may have different certification timelines or requirements. Keep issuing more ESOPs and founder has left Admittedly, I dont know how significant potential dilution from this is, but usually, ESOPs arent so massive as to completely shift the dynamic of investing outcomes. The founder left to start new companies after having a fallingout with the board, yes, but he hasnt ever publicly trashed the company or even corroborated claims of it being a PR Scam so maybe he just didnt like it and went to do something else.",Neutral,0,0.9487494230270386,Reply

I do think, if youre patient, simply buying the 2026 options will be wildly profitable. Per my thesis in this post, I do think Archer is currently undervalued by a significant margin. By October, ACHR should announce entry into and timeline for For Credit airframe type certification, and confirmed that their georgia plant remains on schedule. I admit October is aggressive, but I have seen significant hype spikes in the sector before. I may need to reload in October for more January 25... According to currently known timelines, we should know by January whether ACHR and JOBY will really start operations during 2025. Once they have confirmed type certification by EOY and rolled even one airframe off their main assembly line, there will be major investor FOMO. nbsp By EOY 2025, or whenever actual first revenue generating sales or flights take place, we will see ASTSlike price movements.",Neutral,0,0.7763223648071289,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-28,"Yeah since you didnt read I guess you missed that part. Jobys market cap is about 3.7bn. Of that, almost 1bn is cashshort term assets. ACHRs cap is about 1.26bn, of which about 450m is cashshort term assets. This leaves about 2.7bn and .8bn in speculative, long term, and IP patent, tech value respectively. nbsp Joby has fully acquired i.e. owns the IP H2Fly Hydrogen powertrain, Xwing autonomous flight, and Uber Elevate ElevateOS for ride ordering. Moreover, Joby has customdesigned nearly their entire airframe. When combined with speculative valuation from successfully entering operations, this value seems fairly reasonable. Even in a bear case, Joby potentially has multiple outlets to offer itself for acquisition or pivot to another method e.g. conversion of existing planes to hydrogen and autonomous flight. nbsp Given the IP disparity Archer designs its own battery packs and some other components, along with the actual airframe of course, my thesis is that Jobys IP and slight schedule lead are now diminishing in relative value compared to Archers actual business plan. Jobys IP stack is cool, but certifying custom build, and operational scaling are going to be harder than for Archer... With certification and operations set to begin next year, Archers superior orderbook and market plans should be valued equivalently to Jobys IP lead at this time. nbsp TLDR Joby fair value for their IP stack and superior product ACHRs superior market entry plan and order book should be worth more now, as risk of complete failure diminishes and likelihood of going to market increases.",Positive,1,0.9964620471000671,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-28,"Yeah Ive seen this and the only substantive issue, especially in the year since this report was published, may be the facility monitoring, Ill get back to that piece in a bit. Overall, and ironic considering their claims of ACHR being misleading, I find the report to be pretty deliberately misleading itself. Top line, Archer has clearly built and flown at least several completely functional Midnight airframes since that report. Regarding the USAF contract Archer has since delivered a fully functional Midnight airframe to the Air Force. Its true that they are behind Joby, but thats always been the case, and I am assuming neither the FAA Special Airworthiness Cert nor the USAF would take delivery of a scam product or vaporware at least, not a full airframe. The USAF potential order for airframes is not a substantial piece of ACHRs overall order book or operating revenue plans in any case, but I dont see why they wouldnt be able to deliver on the relatively small order if USAF continues to pursue it. They mention ACHR contracts with USAF related to autonomous flight and other highertech initiatives. I do find it likely ACHR will not continue as a leader in that space, as Jobys technology in these areas is indeed superior, as I mention in my OP. These contracts are a fraction 30M or less of the main eVTOL initiative there in any case. Highlighting these as potential losses is misleading in the context of ACHRs main business. Grizzly consistently mentions the dollar value of exercised warrants and share awards in the context of the obviouslyinflated price of August 23. While yes, those shares may be worth a considerable amount if ACHR succeeds in going to market, Grizzly leads with very large numbers attached to those share issuances while barely mentioning how unusual a price above 7 is for ACHR. Also as I addressed in OP, Grizzly talks up Joby throughout, but Jobys total share dilution is over double ACHRs total outstanding shares to this day. While there may be valid complaints about dilution, its outrageous to be in up arms over the issuances when a key competitor has done so much more. They obliquely imply that the companies investing in ACHR are doing so because theyre being given an opportunity to sell out of the company at the inflated share price. Stellantis has since continued to agree to investments in the company, with direct sharesforwork programs to ramp manufacturing. This is a pretty clear rebuttal of a number of points made by Grizzly. nbsp Regarding the manufacturing, flight videos, and overall progress being clouded ACHR has ramped up PR and specific posting of facilities and progress on the Georgia plant. Midnight clearly exists and clearly flies, including a more recent 10 minute unedited flight test video, an exact rebuttal of one of Grizzlys issues Where they posted a similar uncut Joby video. Its also a little odd that Grizzly was complaining about editing to make a flight appear longer in a video that was already only 042 seconds, which... okay? The source who claimed 2028 was Optimistic for certification is clearly not tracking how overall sector is making progress. If thats the case, Joby would be on target for 2027 at best also, and they have a complete custom ecosystem to certify, not just offtheshelf parts. Both companies, in the year following, are maintaining target times and presenting percenttocompletion that still targets 2025. It is possible still that Archers certification will be delayed to late 25 or 2026... I do find it worrying that they are still a little handwavey about their completely compliant for credit airframes being ready to go or in testing. I have addressed schedule risks several times when posting about the sector and ACHR specifically. That said, since August 23, their main Georgia plant is clearly progressing and they maintain the EOY timeline for completion as of this quarter. nbsp The claims about doing on site observation of the airport are at least interesting. However, its notable that the week they spent observing was exactly when the full size Midnight was built but not yet FAA certified. This timeframe lines up with the archer engineer saying they would have to wait as I find it rather plausible flight tests were paused between completion of the Midnight full size prototype and its airworthiness certification note that the continue to test flight daily were from prior announcements that occurred before their observational period I also have very little faith in the reports of supposed eyewitnesses when they are being asked about things by a literally activist shortseller company... Maker and Midnight are both quiet and small airframes, unique looking, true, but also short range. A full test flight could occur over the space of an hour or less, so even daily test flights may be missed routinely by people simply on the same airport grounds. Note that Grizzly did not consult or reference FAA Air Traffic Control, flight plan logs, or other possible authoritative sources for air time. Moreover, the empty facility they visited is very definitely online given that actual photo and video from the manufacturing process has been posted, and, again, at least several operational midnight airframes exist including one that USAF deemed acceptable for delivery. nbsp TO BE CLEAR I am not saying ACHR is definitely a superstar company thats going to be shitting out eVTOLs into the air taxi market next year... I just dont think that the piece published by Grizzly is a reasonable analysis.",Neutral,0,0.8592925369739532,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-28,"First of all, if youre holding shares, you should be fine over a longer time horizon, this is around where we should bottom out... why ACHR is valued how it is right now Archer and JOBY, and all other eVTOL companies except EHang in china, are prerevenue companies. In other words, theyre spending money on RD but havent yet begun operations. Archer isnt actually selling or flying airframes commercially yet. As a result, traditional valuations such as PE, Dividend return, DCF, and other methods are either difficult or impossible to apply as a valuation mechanic. financial information such as cash burn rate compare to likely start of revenue generation substitute for this as a risk indicator. It does have generally nonbinding commitments for airframe sales valued at 6bn, as well as plans to selfoperate an air taxi service. Along with projected growth in the new Advanced Air Mobility sector, archer is theoretically well positioned for massive growth when operations do begin... Conversely, two major risks remain to getting operations. Most notably, type certification from the FAA saying the aircraft can fly passengers, and scaling of manufacturing supply chain and completion of main assembly line. Theres also a wider risk of a lack of infrastructure to support Air Taxis or the sector simply not catching on as something the public pays for. Essentially, the value of the company is then Possible major growth as a first mover in a new industry minus risk of catastrophic failure. Investing long term is saying Im parking money here knowing im speculating on success while short selling is saying i think the risks here are too great, and this company will fail before reaching operations. Why, specifically, its current exact value? Well, per my post, i have no idea and think its undervalued, so i am invested, but other people clearly have assessed the risk profile differently. nbsp As to why its red or green on any given day... its generally red and low priced when no catalysts or news comes out... Archer is very much on the hook to be much more concrete about its schedule, and soon, or the perceived risks grow a lot... many people are probably getting scared off by the relative lack of news given the supposedly tight timeline to start production. it goes WAY green when catalysts hit... new deals, timelines being confirmed, advances in certification progress, etc... that is, when the likelihood of future revenues increase and risks decrease and investors pile in. nbsp EOY prediction... Given the above and the fact that i am heavily invested in Oct and Jan calls. whatll happen? Basically two possible routes 1. ACHR begins for credit FAA type certification flights and proceeds quickly due to having mostly off the shelf parts i cover this vs Jobys custom build in my OP, and completes its Georgia manufacturing plant. If both of these occur by EOY, we probably go back to near 52w high 7 if not higher. 2. Any delays, setbacks, or major negative news occurs, or radio silence continues, and price continues to tank as investors look for shorter term gains and are unwilling to keep money parked in ACHR while it struggles to get running. nbsp Past EOY 24 to EOY 25 If they succeed in an entry in service date by EOY 25, that is, commercial operations begin, then we get to see an ASTSlike move in the price, as retail and institutions surge in on the hype train. This may be dampened a bit if Joby enters service earlier especially if Joby begins operations and encounters problems with operations We may see pops much earlier in 25 if nonbinding order agreements become binding as a result of Certification. 6bn in confirmed order backlog would be MASSIVE compared to 6bn in uncommitted orders. Conversely, if for credit testing begins but they faildelay for some reason, price tanks back to 3 range. If manufacturing plant has delays or failures, or production stalls due to supply chain issues, commensurate reduction in share price. nbsp Overall if you have shares you have several strategies Very long hold, as the Bull case through 2030 implies explosive potential 10x or more in share price, more if we get meme price spikes Sell on hype taking profits next time really good news comes out... then either be happy with that or rebuy when price slips between good news announcements. nbsp why do i have shorter term options? Well i have shares too, the short term options I play are very much gambling... but, as i describe above, this very speculative tech sector can see impressively insane hype spikes. Great news about beginning for credit testing or new orders or firm commitments, all trigger runs past 5 to 67. The time between now and EOY 24 is absolutely critical for the stated timeline and therefore speculative options could pay out massively. If price spikes, i also take out Strangles add puts to the mix to account for bad news and price drops.",Neutral,0,0.9856484234333038,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-28,"yeah thats definitely a major possibility. I dont address the sectorwide risks like FAA delays and such here i have in past posts on this subject though. This is more about the comparative value of ACHR JOBY... I generally assume in this post that both companies will experience similar sector risks like slow FAA or supply chain to some extent. And i maintain that ACHRs potential revenue streams and overall risk profile justify a valuation similar to Jobys minus Jobys cash advantage value nbsp I suppose if you assume all revenue generation will be pushed to 2026 or later, ACHRs cash position is more concerning, but because total shares are so much lower, the dollar for dollar dilution of long run profits 2030 or even 2040 for shares if achr does another funding round is still unlikely to be a major factor... additionally, ACHR may be able to sell airframes overseas to committed customers who are able to certify in their own jurisdictions especially Saudi ArabiaUAE, and both companies are likely to be able to operate overseas nbsp Still, absolutely, this is a speculative industry... but look at ASTSRKLB for example, very similar trajectory and similar background of prerevenue speculative tech that finally went live.

Reddit,2024-08-27,"Chat GPT summary Cassava Sciences, a biotech company focused on Alzheimers disease, has come under scrutiny due to its lead drug candidate, Simufilam. Initially, the company showed promising early clinical results, but recent developments have cast significant doubt on the drugs efficacy. The indictment of Dr. Wang, a key researcher involved in Simufilams earlystage studies, for allegedly fabricating data, alongside the sudden resignation of CEO Remi Barbier and the SVP of Neuroscience, has raised red flags. These events, coupled with ongoing legal challenges, have led to increased skepticism about the validity of the data supporting Simufilam and the companys overall credibility. The companys situation has deteriorated further with concerns over potential unblinding of trial data and inconsistencies in reported results. Despite Cassavas new leadership promising transparency, the current circumstances have significantly undermined confidence in Simufilams chances of success. The ongoing investigations and the potential 40 million SEC settlement add to the financial strain on the company. Given the high stakes and the reliance on a single product, any negative outcomes from the trials or legal proceedings could severely impact the stock. As a result, the overall outlook for Cassava remains highly cautious, with significant risks to its future viability.",Negative,-1,0.9999977350234985,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-17,"Be careful!! UNG invests in Gas Futures Henry Hub. So that means it invests in gas delivered 12 months out. They sit currently at 2.1 or whatever. However, prices for JanFeb futures sit at 3.5. i suggest you read up on the term Contango. Basically, everything else equal, natgas front month could just tick up to 3.5 while UNG doesnt gain a single cent! Let that sink in. Put in other words Contango brings high rolling cost, when you change from front month to next, you can pay up. So while on the screen it shows you that gas is more expensive, UNG didnt increase. It just changed the contract. On the fundamental side there is a massive gas glut in US going on. Oil producers just do ,,drill baby drill because shale oil production is massively in the money. Those guys ger natgas as side product, so even if gas sits at 1.6, 1.7mmbtu, the guys keep drilling because oil pays for the side product to get rid off. Check out what happened in spring only around 1.61.7, gas producers started to shut in. Not before. Long story short if nothing fundamentally changes, the play is short natgas. If you bet on dropping oil prices, middle east escalation and massively hot in summer and cold in fallswinter, then you can do long natgas.

However it is difficult for the American gas market to capitalise on these high global prices as gas must first me liquified in order to be exported as LNG, which is a major bottleneck. The main US LNG facilities lie on the coast of Texas and have been hit by several hurricanes this year resulting in less natgas becoming LNG. This is severely reducing the American export of Natgas and driving prices down in the domestic US markets.",Negative,-1,0.978282630443573,Reply

It is the most efficient energy source at creating heat. Further to your point about using nat gas in data centres, AI demands a lot more energy AND water than we can sustain. Nat gas will remain useful to those who use it for heat, as it is far more efficient than other energies. My favourite example is the farmers. To dry grain, corn etc which has to be done right after harvest, to maintain the value of their crops, farms will have to use 50,000 of natural gas within a short time period.

There is only so much storage for this glut in supply, and the technologydemand for conversion to LNG cant keep up as of yet either. So as the demand for storage increases past the actual price of nat gas, nat gas prices turn negative. As long as this is a net positive for oil producers, they could care less about the biproduct.

Reddit,2024-08-17,"Maybe the term I am using is confusingincorrect. The positions are long NG. Downside means unrealized losses. Each 50 cent move down generates 5,000 loss per contract. So, a 0.50 drop equals 5,000 unrealized loss on the first position. Then you enter position 2. So, another 0.50 drop equals a 10,000 unrealized loss on position 1 and a 5,000 dollar unrealized loss on position 2. Then you enter position 3. So, another 0.50 drop equals 15,000 unrealized loss on position 1, a 10,000 unrealized loss on position 2, and a 5,000 loss on position 4. Then you enter position 4. There the exercise stops and the total unrealized loss at this point is 15,000 10,000 5,000 30,000. If price goes down the unrealized loss continues to grow. EDIT 1 For further clarity, at the point of entry on position 4 the unrealized loss of only position 4 is 0.00, but the accumulated unrealized loss is 30,000.",Neutral,0,0.9484807252883911,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-17,"Hmm, tough to say. So on the gas power trading side the holy grail is to handle the fact that power is extremely spiky because it cannot be stored effectively. i.e. if you have a slight mismatch between demand and supply, your grid trips withing milliseconds. Different markets and roles are designed to secure stable operations. But for a trader that results in super nasty math, especially with more and more renewables entering the game. Think of it this way Generation is of highly stochastic nature, e.g. sun shines or doesnt, you know basically 5 min ahead and can lose double digit generation in a few minutes same with wind. Demand is a bit more projectable, but still stochastic depending on temperature, holidays, events, grid trips, etc.. So you have random input, random output, random pricing, random trader behaviour, etc. in a pretty fragile system and illiquid market. The arms race there is predicting and interpreting weather better and be able to trade, dispatch and balance extremely fast. On gas its similar, a bit less dramatic because you can store and compress to a certain extent grid doesnt trip in milliseconds, but rather minutes or hours. But trading is very much coupled to power, so it brings the same challenges as all is connected through nasty feedbacks. On top the challenge for gas is the geopolitical mess. In LNG the worst I have worked with are flexible LNG cargos, so basically you have a physical option with floating strikes. Say you have a cargo LNG that is set for Japan, but you can reroute if its more profitable to send to Europe. You can think of it as an option with the strike being the difference between European and Japanese gas price, and on top of it the freight cost and fuel difference. All of this is variable. Now if you take such a decision momentarily, you can fix all of it and lock in the profit for rerouting. The challenge starts when you need to value such an option in the future, e.g. to know how much you are willing to sell it for or buy it for. Figuring that out I would say is one of the most secret sauce for an LNG operation. Just off the top of my head, no claim for completeness or anything and Im sure there are pros around here that can challenge me on all this.",Neutral,0,0.9347694516181946,Reply

Now ur back at even and u say to urself Im still even ill just hold...weeksmonths pass and now ur down 1020 and u start to get nervous and that sinking feeling in ur stomach and decide to sell at a loss loosing 30k. Situation 2 u make money and book a big profit and suddenly think your nostradomous and can repeat it again with another stock so u do it again except it doesnt have the same outcomes and u loose big.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"The colored gemstone market is complex and opaque. A spot price is unrealistic in a market of such varying qualities. Its not the first time people have tried to corner a gemstone market, most fail, government regulated supply is a weak hold and product moves through with the correct connections and money. Blue Zircon can be found in many localities and white zircon can be treated. The price and comparison should also be measured against a basket of similar gem material which you will find a similar trend in pricing that many mid tier gems have moved up in value over the last several years. This last year in Tucson anecdotal discussions with gem dealers and purchasers indicated some level of inverse pricing from mine to consumers, it was more expensive material at the mine source than what was being sold in Tucson, mainly due to cash buyers paying premiums for large lots at the source. The price to reach 10K per carat is unrealistic in a lifetime term. This material is just not that rare to reach high grade ruby and sapphire pricing. if you can get 300 you are good, if you get 500 for high quality large pieces great, but the average is lower and there is a lot of material that is treated flooding the market some show up directly at the mines. A good resource on pricing and markets is GIA field Gemologist Wim Vertriest who has written many articles on sourcing stones and the market in general and has a large focus in SE Asian markets. Separately if you are looking to have large high quality pieces cut please reach out, I have some experience in faceting",Neutral,0,0.9961255192756653,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-07,"In Mar 2020, when the world was shutting down because of Covid, I decided it was a great idea to take a vacation to Cambodia and force my gf to come with me ... is all you really need to know about the amount of forethought that went into any of OPs plans, including trying to monopolize a semiprecious gemstone that CHIPS OFF easily as the next trend in wearable jewelry. Their hardness is a 6 on a scale of 10, where diamonds are a 10. The reason ppl can wear diamonds on their fingers is bc they dont chip when abused. Theres also the fact that actual big money can just reopen mines at scale if these were to ever actually appreciate substantially in value, which they wont, because they suck as precious stones and dont have any industrial use. No one cares about how old and sparkly they are if they cant be effectively cut into a particular shape because theyre prone to shattering first.. Also, the math isnt even correct. 1m carats at 10ea is 10m, not 250k. Also, current price per carat appears to be nowhere near 150300 after a brief google search. Also, OP appears to be trying to spin this investment failure into an even farther fetched plan by creating a crypto token and tokenizing blue zircon into a realworldasset... but its already a real world asset, just not one that anyone wants. Also, Ill admit I am jealous though of OPs access to mommy and daddys money and his unlimited free time to spend 5 years chasing such a thoroughly halfbaked idea.

Reddit,2024-08-07,Several years ago I stumbled into a weird rock market. A rock called a Saffordite was sought after by extremely eccentric people and considered very rare. Except I found an easy way to find these rocks. With a few friends we went out and mined roughly 500 lbs of these rocks and contacted a guy who sold them. He bought the whole lot from us for around 10k dollars. We went back out and mined another 200 or so lbs but when we reached back out the broker told us hed sold roughly 100 lbs of our first find before the market collapsed. Once there was a steady sales stream the interest and bidding wars for these rocks was gone. To this day saffordites sell for pennies an ounce... Thats how we single handedly crashed a rock market.,Neutral,0,0.5039416551589966,Reply

But then after he retired it basically becalmed his full time jobbusiness. And let me tell you, business is booming. Ive seen some wild things while traveling in that circle of high end gem and mineral dealing. In Colorado for example, where weed is legal but the banks wont touch it, Ive seen people come in and drop 30k, 50k etc. in cash on a single tourmaline, with the intent to resell it at some point as a way to legitimize their capital. We call them Wookiees because theyre typically very hairy, and dont bathe much. Then theres the oil and gas geologists who have absurd amounts of money but dress like theyre in between hikes. Theres the HealyFealys who believe the crystals have some sort of magical properties. How they pick a rock thatll increase their Luck, or Prosperity, or bolster their love life is anyones guess. Then youve got the standard investors who are looking to diversify their wealth into collectible class assets or Asset Class Collectibles Ive heard both used. Theyre looking for something they can park their money in and resell for a profit later. You also get just collectors.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Hmmm. Blue zircon has a similar hardness to emerald, quartz and garnet. Fair to tough range. A lot of people say dont recommend emerald for a daily wear ring or engagement ring as can get scratched and damaged. So ..it is more preferred corundum stones and diamond for that. There are also a lot of advancements in synthetic diamonds happening now first mostly yellow, but also blue diamonds might be created. Sapphire the most famous blue stone can already be created synthetically and blue topaz as well is relatively affordable just from natural sources and a fair amount of good color tanzanite floating around. There are some that like collecting niche gemstones but that is a small part of the market compared to the jewelry industry. The name..is also a problem in that it has nothing to do with cubic zirconia, but the name zircon sounds similar so peoples perception it is a synthetic or low cost gemstone. But one of its biggest flaws in use in jewelry is that exposure to UV can turn blue zircon into an unappealing brown. That is the main reason it has not been widely adopted for jewelry. Almost a similar problem to welo opal that turns dull and yellow over time. Apatite...another blue stone that has a lovely shade can also fade and change color with UV exposure.",Neutral,0,0.9953140020370483,Reply

I would look to partner with a manufacturer and begin to make peace with your investment. Its easy to get overwhelmed with facts and figures, you did well. You state average cost at 10carat with a current price of 100150carat thats a serious gain. However what your dealing with now is beanie babies in the 90s.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Most of what OP said is of course complete bullshit. Blue zircons are not the oldest gems on earth. Zircons in general, because of their small Uranium content, are used in Geology to date the rocks they are in using the UPb dating method. So they found some inherited small zircons in an Australian conglomerate that were 4.4 Ga years old. those are neither blue though nor do they have anything to do with OPs zircons. OPs zircons are less than 1 million year old and therefore very young certainly much much younger than any diamonds. In fact, you would never find natural i.e. not heat treated old, gemquality zircons. The radioactive elements in them mainly U and Th decay over time and slowly destroy the crystal lattice. All old zircons will therefore look somewhat eaten up. Blue Zircons are also neither rare nor even natural. The blue color is achieved by heating gemquality zircons which are usually yellow or orange up to about 1000degC. Zircons themselves are not rare at all either, almost every rock has some in them. Even large gemquality specimens are relatively common. Thats why you can get them for literally pennies on the internet.",Neutral,0,0.9999521970748901,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-07,"Ive got a lot of questions and thoughts on this, especially on the 10k per carat forecast. Is blue zircon facet rough stone as labour intensive to produce as diamond? Using diamond as thats the only other jewellery stone I know that has this value per carat The hardness of zircon is far far less than diamond at c6.5, this is a serious factor in pricing a gemstone. You say that the mines in Cambodia were closing but youve also got Sri Lanka and Australia which have huge reserves of zircon. Which I guess would make up the shortfall from Cambodia? The 10k you mentioned, I assume thats in gem format not rough or facet ready?

Its not undervalued, it is valued at what the market is willing to pay for it and their plan to artificially drive up demand is laughably unhinged to anyone who understands anything about anything. OP makes it sound like theres only one closed mine in Cambodia, but their own country, Australia, produces like 40 of the worlds supply of blue zircon and its also mined in Sri Lanka and Africa, as well. Zircon itself is a very common mineral, like its everywhere in the Earths crust. Its also a terrible gemstone due to its brittleness and tendency to scratch. Weve also been able to grow and mass produce zirconscubic zirconia in a laboratory setting, which requires no slave labor, for decades now, and its becoming cheaper and more efficient year after year. There are also multiple other gemstones with similar visual qualities that are much more suitable for jewelry applications and are much cheaper, like moissanite and blue topaz. The extra stupid part of this is that there are plenty of gemstonesminerals which actually have the increasing scarcity that OP is looking for. Turquoise is a great example. It is a relatively rare semiprecious gemstone with only a handful of mines producing it in any significant quantity worldwide. Most of what you see labeled as turquoise on the market now is actually cheaper and more common stones marketed as turquoise because of how scarce real turquoise is becoming. Its basically only found in great quantities in the American southwest and the mines in the southwest have been running dry and falling short of demand for quite a while.

You charge 40 more for organic lemons, 50 more for conflictfree lemons. You pack the Capitol with lemon lobbyists, you get a Kardashian to suck a lemon wedge in a leaked sex tape.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"your analysis is partially correct. You analyzed the probable cause of the carry trade unwind but didnt discuss the accelerant of the decline. The rate of change of the unwind was due to the USDJPY depreciation. Strong Yen appreciation started to make the trade unprofitable and people quickly began to exit all at once. Your analysis on Fed rate cuts didnt discuss how it would impact USDJPY. Typically, Fed rate cuts would weaken the dollar and strengthen yen. However, if most of yen weakness dollar strength came from selling yen for carry trade. And that demand for dollar short yen isnt there because the carry trade isnt profitable due to the expected glide path of Fed rates, then USDJPY would weaken, but not dramatically drop. I guess Im arguing that we have to look at the rate of change of USDJPY when the Fed begins to cut. If its disorderly, then yes I agree with your thesis.

Reddit,2024-08-07,"I had a whole thing written up as a joke but it just got way too long and I couldnt think of enough engrish jokes to keep it going. US COVID policy was regarded and caused rampant inflation The only known way to curb inflation under Keynesian theory is to cause a recession. You cause a recession by jack up the prime rate until the economy stalls. Japanese COVID policy was not regarded so they kept rates lows. Since their rate is so low and everyone elses is so high you could borrow money in yen, move on forex to another currency and buy whatever the fuck you wanted like NVDA and make mad cash for free carry trade. Yen pouring out of Japan caused the value of the yen to plummet until pensioners started to revolt because they cant afford energy, particularly naturalgas for heating and cooking which is imported into Japan so the weakening yen has made it expensive as fuck. Japan buying LNG is why a company like Cheniere exist which I have been long on for 10 years. So the pensioners have made the politicians promise to strengthen the yen and their plan was to raise their prime rate then sell US bonds 400B and buy Japanese bonds instead. Japan announces they are going to raise rates and the carry trade is now less profitable and more risky so everyone doing it starts selling their stuff and figuring out what else to but. Mean time JPow announces hes going to start dropping the US rate since people at Intel have started jumping out windows. This spooks the YenUSD carry trade in particular and is why weve had a negative month. Its not actually negative growth, its just the end of free yen. Shits selling until it starts causing panic on Monday in Japan sending jitters everywhere else. If Japan dumps their US bonds then the US is going to have several failed auctions as people snatch up the cheaper Japanese ones. Confidence in the yen is failing. JPow and Ueda his Japanese counterpart must have made a backroom deal to chillthefuckout and they both announce they are going to CtFO to calm the markets while they figure out how to unwind the carry trade.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"Nice market analysis for uranium. Any energy source will undoubtedly be valuable especially one as seemingly magical as nuclear. Oil cartels will remain king however.

Until we learn how to secondarily use depleted Uranium besides using it to fucking blast the planetkill people arguably the most profitable thing but I digress I dont think it will reach the prestigepower of oil think of plastics, gas, rubber, roads, etc. I think thats what really limits the potential of uranium, the fact that we have to store it I believe theres now safe depleted uraniums but I forget the names. Either way its almost useless What Im saying is, we need a more vitaldynamic use for uranium daily besides energy. For now its just a fancy coal. I hope to see a future where we have totally stable nuclear and have nuclear powered things that can quantum compute things our mind cant even comprehend.

Reddit,2024-08-02,"I daily a ARM Windows laptop for nearly a year now. My desktop runs an AMD CPU. I dont have any modern Intel products as I think they are shit. I am an Intel investor. Some ARM processors might be better than some x86 processors, but its a misunderstanding that you cant achieve the efficiency of ARM processors with x86. Modern CPUs all run microcode, so the architecture is pretty much irrelevant, the performance and efficiency depends on the design of the chip and the manufacturing process. Apple Silicon is great because they allow very big dies and the most modern manufacturing techniques, which results in expensive and very good chips. Every chip manufacturer has its own go at those decisions. AI is overhyped. The PC architecture that includes the use of x86 processord will NOT die. Take a look at the number of attempts that have been made, including from intel! Im writing those lines from an ARM device, that is for me a lot more attractive than any PC notebook can be. But it doesnt replace the consistancy the PC platform has offered, and which is oftentimes critical for the applications PCs are used in. Be realistic. Intel splitted up in 2 parts now chip design and manufacturing. Both are shit at the moment. All 12th, 13th and 14th gen products are inefficient as hell and pretty much defective. Meteor Lake is most obviously a stopgap. But they heard the call and the next design manufactured by TSMC looks very promising. Manufacturing will take a little bit longer to recover, but the investments have been made, they do have all the best stuff coming up again. Those were my objective arguments, now to the stuff I dont understand and probably will never Investors Intel itself has big challenges at the moment. Their recent chips are essentially dying. They are trying to lie themselves out of the issues, but a complete recall of not only desktop chips, but at least the more powerful notebook chips is very possible.

Im an engineer btw, I never worked for a single company that doesnt use some legacy software that only works on Windows machines, and that as an engineer you can even choose to have an Apple computer since most software wont even work there. Im not saying that ARM will not replace x86, just dont get your hopes up that it will happen as quickly as it did for Apple, it will take time.",Neutral,0,0.994684636592865,Reply
Reddit,2024-08-02,"I think the advantages you mentioned are pretty minor in comparison to the sheer cost difference. I say that as someone who built a small form factor PC literally 3 months ago you can check my history of my various woes doing so. A ps5 pro is equivalent is about a 3070ti PC build which with all the various parts will cost significantly more. Games also whilst cheaper on PC arent free so the money saved from buying a console can be put towards games which can be heavily subsidised by game passes. And thats not to mention console exclusives GTA 6 coming to PC a year later probably, games being optimised for consoles which means PC specs creeping higher and most people already owning laptops for the non gaming aspects. I built my SFF PC for the reasons you mentioned but the overwhelming majority of people would be far better served with a laptopconsole combo compared to building a gaming PC.",Neutral,0,0.9506599307060242,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-02,"Literally only software engineers can do most work on macs, basically all others need a Windows computer. This might also not be completely true for all types of software engineers, if you work with embedded systems you will most likely need a Windows computer as well. Yeah sure, but that doesnt bode well in general for all companies, usually laptops are bought in bulk and they just buy the same 2 models for everyone, one 15 inch and another 13 inch. I have a hard time believing a lot of the IT offices will want to offer more options than they already do. It doesnt make sense to give different Windows computers to people that are only using office suite teams, and even then a lot of companies already give Macs to these people as Macs are a lot more user friendly and have less problems for IT to deal with overall. Again Im pretty sure ARM will take over x86 eventually, I just dont expect it to happen as fast as it did with Apple computers for Windows machines.

And by optimised for consoles, I meant a severe increase in fps relative to quality for the hardware theyre packing. Devs know what the exact specs of consoles are and can make sure they hit exactly what they need for consoles as opposed to PC where far stronger hardware can still mean a much worse fps and quality compared to consoles.

Academic credibility Courseras the first online learning platform to get the American Council on Educations seal of approval. That means their stuff can count for real college credit 6.
