So, a TOST investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects TOST the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors. All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for TOST. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know. She absolutely refuses to doa news conference."

That said, does anyone who has dug into TOST financials have thoughts as to why the stock price has been so anemic?  Every quarter they seem to meet/beat expectations and they are growing and the platform itself is really good -- so why does it seem to vacillate between $21-25?  Is the $13B market cap too rich?  Are folks waiting until it becomes profitable?  Not enough Wall Street coverage?  I bought a few shares but would love to go &#34;all in&#34; on Toast!  What am I missing?  Thanks and good luck, Longs!"

Since we were going to be in Colorado all summer last year I decided to take a job pouring beer at a popular pizza shop. I worked Friday and Saturday nights and had some fun, but the best thing I took away from the experience was this incredible Tost platform. I’ve been trading it fearlessly because I saw firsthand what an incredible product it is. The end users love it. The owner of the shop complained about all the fees, but acknowledged he couldn’t get out of this solution into something else without significant interruption and cost. I implemented oracle financial software back in the 90s. This is the oracle of restaurant management. Go look at oracle stock and how it has performed since the 90s. I don’t need any money, but this stock is going to make my beneficiaries very wealthy."

You can get to an &#34;adjusted&#34; figure which looks good by eliminating the reported cost of stock issued for compensation, but those shares remain  outstanding forever and are  forever dilutive.
