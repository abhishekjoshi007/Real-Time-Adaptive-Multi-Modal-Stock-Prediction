Yahoo,2024-10-03,"Here is what&#39;s at risk with taxes on us Investors in November&#39;s election:Kamala Harris and Biden together stated last winter that they would liketo tax long-term capital gains as &#34;ordinary income&#34;. So, a TOST investorin a 24% tax bracket selling his stock would be taxed $2,400 instead of$1,500 for his $10,000 capital gain.But Harris/Biden also don&#39;t like Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts, so letting themexpire next year would turn a 24% marginal tax bracket into a 28% taxbracket and the stock sale would be taxed $2,800. That would almostDOUBLE it! Mr. Trump likes the LT gain tax right where it is at 15%.Harris/Biden have also stated that the top corporate tax rate (the one thataffects TOST the most) should be increased from 21% currently to 28%, anincrease of 33% on this company that would certainly hurt it&#39;s performanceand stock price.Mr. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate from 21% to 15%. Like the LTgain tax proposals, Harris wants the rate almost DOUBLE what Mr. Trumpwants it to be.Harris also wants to tax un-realized gains for higher income investors. All othertax increases listed above impact ALL investors.Kamala Harris has always been anti-business/anti-investor. Her presidencywould be bad for the market and bad for TOST. It&#39;s not investors like us whowould be electing her. It&#39;s people like Taylor Swift fans who have no ideawhat Harris has in mind to do to us.And it&#39;s not like Harris wants people to know.

thats also spinning Gold from a lie.  Historically 1 in 10 survive. 

those new accounts represent closures and reopening on the same foot print.  I say 1 in 20 survive which means on 24 months those are 10 accounts.

Toast has never ever reported positive income or profit.  Toast is a lie, right down to the dirty underhanded ousted CEO now on the board Mr Greg Camarato.

Only after he is gone from the board will there be a positive direction for the company.  It&#39;s R &amp; D serve as prime example.

Yahoo,2024-08-15,"as an end user and employer of Toast 
as a Wall Street Veteran of over 30 years.

Toast had a great concept. 

However the company is a self imploding lie, horribly run, and a disgrace with development.  Its a prime acquisition target around 5$ a share nothing more.

The current model is to sell many different services you don&#39;t need to pay for and can obtain direct.   Optimization through Google. are two lies told at once for a diagnostic.  Optimization needs occur on your own paid for website.  This is one example of robbing the ignorant.

we TRPrice begins liquidating its long, we know the fat lady will have sung.

What was once great was the baxk end diagnostic and reporting...  the new version doesn&#39;t give th3 same information at the rate The old version did..  why would anyone spend R&amp;D on such matter, while moat continue to old reporting.

last with Greg Camerata on the Board, as an ousted CEO...  TOAST is going nowhere..  its a portfolio lie and looser in 5h3 next economy.

The new store sales  clients is yet another lie...  30 year Restaurant closes a new one comes in.. now using Toast.  Given new restaurant openings and historical facts to operation 1 in 10 survive beyond 24 months...longevity of operations and revenue will crumble.

TOST is the short of this century.
just look at the debt to equity ratio..  when revenue begins to fade, then comes the implosion.
