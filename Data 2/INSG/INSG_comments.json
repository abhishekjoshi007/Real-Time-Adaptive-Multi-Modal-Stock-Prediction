It&#39;s expected to grow in the 30% annual range for many years.  For AAOI it&#39;s the AI data center market which is also expected to grow for at least the next decade.The beauty in both these companies is their runs are still in a very early stage (which ensures they&#39;ll be remain very volatile going forward...not for the faint of heart).  But long term, unless something dramatic happens to change market dynamics, the sweet spot they both currently enjoy means the odds will be strongly in their favor of continuing to head north."

My wife works with the products and their scheduled procedures are ramping up fast. Looking for $60 plus early November with earnings . I’ve followed it for last 4 quarters, been great. P/E multiple is high but it’s growing without international exposure, which should come soon. Take care sir"

It must be really selling like hot cakes, if you know what I mean. Now if Brace is saying JULY month has imitated q1 and q2 growth, it’s possible that MIFI growth could triple this q3? Being profitable company with a hot item product that is cash cow producing cash flow positive qtr after qtr, it will be unconscionable to sell at 1X price to sales and the stock down 92% after having the best balance sheet ever in its history.What’s fascinating is the shorts continue to grow and even at its highest number of shares even though they know that removal of Going Concern is certain to happen at anytime now which remains the still biggest catalyst. After losing 1100 folds, still hasn’t learned a lesson although everyone knows this remain a bargain and dirt cheap stock. Well , will be here as long as it takes."

Here&#39;s what I could find:For the last year. Telematics revenue is reported as &#34;Services and Other&#34; for a total revenue of $60M. This includes revenue from their SaaS subscriptions too, unfortunately I couldn&#39;t find a breakdown of just Telematics.In the last 10Q their last 6 months revenue called out that &#34;The $4.8 million increase in services and other revenues is primarily due to increased Subscribtion revenues related to the terms of a two-year service contract renewal with a major customer that was effective in April 2024.&#34;Meaning the Subscription revenues must be in the range of at least $10 - $20M. That translates to $40M - $50M. of annual revenues by Telematics? If we consider 35% margins on it, since obviously it&#39;s a profitable business, or it couldn&#39;t be sold for a higher price. Translates to Earnings of $15M. So I think they sold the business at 3 to 4X of their earnings. Sounds like a fair deal! The average seller&#39;s discretionary earnings (SDE) multiple for small businesses is between 1.5x and 4.0x.Now coming back to impact on INSG. Clearly the $52M cash coming in will make INSG debt free. That&#39;s a clean balance sheet no body thought was possible a year ago. Q3 guidance isn&#39;t affected. However in Q4 I feel the quarterly guidance will drop maybe by $7 - $10M as Telematics have exited.Thoughts ??"

We haven’t even seen any analysts upgrade yet which we know is coming soon and inevitable and of course the removal of Going Concern which is guaranteed. In my opinion, over analyzing at this stage especially at this price is simply not applicable yet and a waste of time. It’s still need a lot of upward corrections just to even fix the brokenness of this stock, more upward correction for its growth, more upward correction for being profitable. There’s no deal here for whether it could be up or down, there’s no other way but up and up for this sp, until it reaches a value play level or a more reasonable valuation. Meantime, enjoy the roller coaster ride (up down, up down) and don’t even try to time the market.Don’t take nor trust my word, do your own dad and invest at your own risks."

Then I was skeptical, due to the fact that this might be the highest margin part if their business, and it certainly generates revenue. The revenue estimates almost certainly will take a hit going forward. I could not find anything in recent ERs pulling out telematics, but I an sure it is not negligible. then I had another thought: I am wondering if they are trimming down the business for an outright sale. Any company interested in INSG&#39;s  5G business would have no interested in a European telematics business , IMO. Time will tell, but I could see the price going either way. Yearly estimates and quarterly revenue will decline. Profits too probably. OTOH they are in a REMARKABLY better financial situation than they were 6 months ago. The risk of bankruptcy is near zero, or zero, for the near to mid future. And 5G business seems to be booming."

I thought it was like $7-8m per quarter, but not 100% sure. I am also thinking this will impact the GM negatively overall unless software business covers the telematic business revenue quickly.Any thought??"

The 2 good earnings reports in a row gives confidence to investors that Inseego has made a u turn and that the next report will also be good.The stock price went down heading into last earnings, but I think that was because investors did not have enough proof that things had turned around. With the last report and with almost all debt paid off I think there will be excitement going into this earnings instead of fear. Just my personal opinion and I am not giving advice to buy or sell."

We don&#39;t hear from him on a daily basis, cause he finally accepted he was wrong on his play. He was so sure that this company would bankrupt that he never took a position in this company when it was trading less than $4, infact he also mocked me and others who took positions and shared our opinions on why this company will turn around!Anyway, I am happy for all the investors, who rode this with me patiently. Like I said earlier, I am not planning to sell any till we reach my first target of $20 (Just $2 away now).  I thought we would get there by end of year, but looks like Xmas came early!!"

Although INSG  has enjoyed a bump from recent news, it has not had a coollective pull back to speak.   We still have about two months to go before earnings time, usually indicating  a lull without more news.  Since Mr. Brace delivered as promised at last earnings, it giives hope that the cycle will continue.  Trying to read the tea leaves is an educated guess.  Even the most notable stocks come back to earth for re grouping after a run    My guess is that it will begin with INSG shortly for a period of time.  When, don&#39;t have the answer."

As always, timing is everything. Enjoy the holiday, my friend."

A certain poster that posts multiple times a day, often responding to his own posts, responded to another members post by agreeing with him that his price target to sell was $20, and then said he might wait a little longer to see if “going concern” would be removed. I thought removing the going concern was going to make INSG a 3 digit price? It was the key to big gains? It all focused on that? \nI’m ok if someone changes their view and comes back to reality.. but the post was deleted.. WHY????\nAgain take his only credible advice , listen to only the right people.

This is very well deserved for INSG, it&#39;s management and the investors who held this and bought more earlier in the year.I am holding on to all my shares, don&#39;t want to sell out too cheap. Remember this is still $1.40 pre-split, a lot more room to grow. Even if they can do just $250M next year in revenues and $50M in earnings for the year with 40% margins (Given the trajectory and results of last two Qs that&#39;s an easy goal) . A simple PE of 20 would value them at a $1 Billion in Market Cap, even with some dilution priced in that is an easy 6X from the current market cap of $170M. That translates to $50 in Stock price next year or $5 pre-split, a very realistic goal.That explains some of the desperateness of the Shorts here, they better cover early, or face significant losses to cover later."

He will never have &lt; $5 cost basis in this stock, that ship has long sailed. However I am glad for all those investors, that saw this change in management, smelled the turnaround coming and invested heavily.Thanks to DealWithIt for sharing such great financial breakdown, he sticks to the facts and projects forward using his experience and detailed logic. I have followed DealWithIt&#39;s advice before in many other stocks like ENLC, that also turned out to be a 5X in less than 2 years.

To me 600% was reasonable gain since the market placed the odds about 10 to 1 against it happening.But....I hold 100% of my &#39;&#39;value&#39;&#39; shares because I just think this is severely undervalued at it&#39;s current market cap and still has a large upside potential to it."

So that made me dig through some financials back from 2020. Here&#39;s the summary:2020:Revenues: $315M (This was a peak number, went down following years)Total Debt: $166M (We carried this debt all the way through to 2024)FCF: -$15MOutstanding Shares: 9M (Adjusted)So the company in 2020 had $160+M in debt, it did slightly greater revenues, yet still had negative Cash flow. It still made all time highs?? Anyone care to explain why? Was it just the GME boom time with 0% interest rates? Was it the hope that Wireless devices will do well in Work From Home Environment?2024 Expected:Revenues: $240M+Total Debt: Drastically reduced to below $80M (I believe)FCF: Will be positive $40M+Outstanding Shares: 12MYet we are priced at $12 or $1.2 pre-adjusted.  So my gut tells me Analysts are going to catch up to the fact that INSG numbers are going to look really good soon, and it&#39;s currently not priced in. Even if we give a 50% discount since we are not in Fed Printing money stage. We can still argue a $40 price point is not out of the ordinary for next year, assuming INSG maintains it&#39;s current earnings.It&#39;s almost a value stock at this point. Don&#39;t you guys agree??"

Still on tract to $20’s in short term but I believe this goes much higher than this due to rapid turn of events in in upward revisions which are insane especially in eps, and then we have the debt reductions, and most of all Going Concern removal hasn’t happened yet but it’s 100% sure it’s coming.These rapid growth changes makes this company different from 6 mos ago, from Q1 and even Q2 and it just keeps getting better and better. Who would have thought this company would turn from very profitable to most profitable in just the last 30 days for 2025? As in from .04 to now .53 eps? Just a thought."

It amounted to about 50% of all their outstanding debt at the time of the exchange.It&#39;s also could become even more valuable if Kamala is elected as the first thing she&#39;ll push for is a higher corporate tax rate (it was at 35% before Trump&#39;s 2017 tax cuts).....because as every Dem knows inflation was caused by corporate greed and had nothing to do with massive gov spending/printing under Biden.  This is  why Kamala in her infinite wisdom pushed for price controls on greedy corporations in her first major policy speech last week.But even if it stays at 21% that 80M in future saving is actually equal to about 100% of their current debt.If the bond holders pushed for more than a 50% piece of equity it would have engaged the &#39;&#39;change of control&#39;&#39; provision in the tax law and wiped out the NOL&#39;s.Or if they passed altogether on a deal and just played/pushed the BK card same thing.That play is over now.....and the 400M in NOL&#39;s are real and will make a major difference going forward.

When INSG&#39;s market cap was only around 20M and their debt 160M things looked bleak.  Some here thought there was simply no reason to for the bondholders to not push for a BK filing and then take possession of the company.  Or if they did feel generous and seek to make a deal it would have to be to their percentage advantage (like taking 80% or more of the common to settle their debt).That didn&#39;t happen for two reasons.  One, the bond holders were also mostly insiders and would know the potential the Brace brought to the company and the facts the turnaround was close. But there was more.This is from the 10K:&#39;&#39;At December 31, 2023, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) related to tax years 2021 and prior of approximately $405.1 million. Approximately $106.9 million of these NOLs have no expiration date. The remainder began to expire in 2024, unless previously utilized. Some of these NOLs may be limited by either past or future changes in control events. The Company had California NOLs at December 31, 2023 of approximately $64.2 million, which begin to expire in 2028, unless previously utilized, and foreign NOLs for its active foreign subsidiaries of approximately $25.5 million, which generally have no expiration date.&#39;&#39;"

He simply knows and care for investors and debt holders, of course it’s obvious that he stands to benefit as well, keep it up! And he’s not greedy, only gets paid $20K/mo.I hope he makes us all not just rich but very rich, lol and one doesn’t usually dream of this as usually we’re all content to make huge gains until you find one like this, an opportunity that could possibly do it, we’ll see if this could get us there."

For instance 90 days ago they expected INSG to lose about 8 cents a share in 2025 (not EBITDA but GAAP  numbers). Now they expect INSG to earn .26 cents on 229M in revenue (or about 57M a quarter which is basically flat revenue from what they just posted).If they earn 26 cents that a P/E of 50...which is pretty high.But from a P/S (less than 1) and from a EBTDA number (maybe 4X) it&#39;s really cheap.Let&#39;s forget those numbers for a moment and just focus on what happens if they post 4 quarters of 65M in 2025.  Very conservative and reasonable to me.That would give them revenue of 260M rather than the 229M current estimate....or another 30M.Only about an 11% growth rate yet how does that translate to earnings?At 40% margins that extra gives them about 12M in additional earnings (remember, at 229M they already have all their bills covered).If there are 14M shares outstanding (let&#39;s say the 12.12 warrants are exercised) that&#39;s still over 80 cents a share in earnings that go straight to the bottom line.So while revenues only jumped 11% earnings would jump from .26 cents to 1.06.  The P/E would move down from 50 to 11. And that&#39;s why when companies that already break evening or better post solid growth numbers their share prices usually skyrocket (and why analysts end up chasing the share price on the way up)."

Until such time, I believe the stock will continue to move higher. The best part of this growth is still in the infancy stage and the CEO remains ultra conservative on giving guidance. Until such time that Brace guides lower, market and analysts will keep raising its target. That’s just the way Wall Street works, the veteran seasoned traders should know. They do overshoots and exaggerates, but it is what it is. Like you saw this stock brought down to pennies, same thing happens when it goes up. No one knows why this went up as high as $219.30, but it did happen. Do your dd.In addition, the Going Concern issue while it connotes negativity has now change into positive vibes,.

You seem to ignore this when just looking at backward P/E ratios.For instance NVDA was expected to grow around 15% a year and their stock traded around the 40 dollar level. Once revenue growth of 50% became obvious to the markets and priced it the share price jumped up 4X.In short...growth is a massive factor in figuring the valuation of any stock.In INSG&#39;s case quarterly revenues jumped from 42M to 45M to 59M the last three quarters. Analysts expected it to stay flat around 45M.This is why INSG jumped up 6X and you can no longer buy it for 2 dollars a share.They are also very profitable at current levels.....EBITDA was over 8M last quarter and if you subtract depreciation from their GAAP earnings they would have made about 30 cents a share.So what you are thinking is strong sell overpriced company is really a rapidly growing cash generating machine in the sweet spot of the FWA market.QUANT values growth, margins and cash generation. INSG has all three at the moment which is why it&#39;s rating is 4.98 out of 5.Just me...but I&#39;d update your valuation models to include those three items in your future valuation models.&#39;&#39;"

It’s really looking brighter now for the future for INSG compared to 6 mos ago. The analyst are raising their TP, but still has a hold rating which is understandable, again most likely because of GC issues still linked to INSG’s FS. But when this is removed, i seriously doubt you can still buy this at this level. I’ve always said in this board, I expect 3 digit gains when it’s removed and I hope I’m right as we all will benefit from it.Just my 2 cents and something to think about.My only request is not to take nor trust my word, do your dd instead and invest at your own risk and also please always be careful on who you listen to. Had you listen to the right people when this was in the $3’s you would have tripled your money already by this time."

Remember that the most beat up stocks, 94.5% down, are the ones that has the biggest gains eventually especially when they turn around. INSG simply demonstrate this qualities and it has now a very clear visibility of its revenues and where it’s headed. In other words they are on the right track to turnaround this company from almost bankruptcy to now heading to profitable growth company. They’re able to establish good and stable relationships with their customers which has become the source and partner for their growth as well as the convertible debt holders allowing maturity extensions and debt reductions appropriate for their size, If you are patient enough, the reward could be pretty size-able and it’s not a long wait anymore as Going Concern could soon be removed at anytime. They have started showing profitability is with in reach and it’s EBITDA are at its highest and continuously and consistently producing positivity. To be honest, and maybe we all have different perspectives and I might be wrong too but I see this as the best time and opportunity to make a lot of money. There’s fear, sure, but if you follow this stock closely like I do, I’m very comfortable with what Brace is doing and he’s gaining my confidence every qtr."

Why even write it? It appears to me you took more time to write it then research it.Under their new CEO revenues (former CEO of SWIR) have exploded up from 40M a quarter to 59M last quarter.Margins are near 40% and most of the growth is in the FWA market which is expected to grow at 30% plus for the next decade.They are solidly cash flow positive and EBITDA will come in at 7 to 10M a quarter going forward.Over all debt has been cut in half (160M down to 80M).At flat growth, which revenues just jumped 20% sequentially, sales will come in around 240M. Current EV puts them around .8 P/S. Industry average is around 3.EBITDA will come in around 36M over the next 4 quarters (again, flat growth) and the industry average is around 14X EBITDA with a 6% growth rate.IMO your article needs work.&#39;&#39;"

Numbers don’t lie!This is really a huge surprise, after almost going bankrupt and issuance of Going Concern, no one probably thought Brace will turn this company around, more so become profitable. Love the CEO, keep it up! And yet there are some people who are willing to sell this stock with menial gains, more so at pennies, unbelievable! No way Jose!"

It is not an adjective word that simply describes the situation of the company. You will have to ask an external auditor and analysts what it really is , what it does to the stock price, what it does to the company, what it does to a third party, what it does to the analysts. What it does to creditors etc. No matter how improved the financial standing, it’s cash on hand, it’s revenue growth, analysts can’t even issue a buy recommendation and get out of pennies valuation nor get out of being 94% down, nor get to $2 bucks, even with key customer who’s deal with INSG is probably more than $500M for several years plus adding new additional large customers.. I tried to explain it to the best I can everyday, sometime every hour, but people will believe what they want to believe, so I rest my case. And I don’t really expect you to trust my word, but at least do your own dd.With NVAX, even if they received $500M, if Going Concern was not removed, there remained a clout that it’s still headed for BK I have doubt it would have gone up even by 50%.At the end of the day to each his own here anyways and there’s no point in arguing, as each one of us is entitled to his own opinion, I will be happy when everyone benefits when it’s removed and I hope you will wait for it because it’s a super positive catalyst for the stock. As I’ve said many times, it remains the biggest catalyst for INSG at this time. Glta."

If INSEEGO  received $500,000,000 up front, can you imagine.   Arthur said it was a nothing burger, not that much money.  Penny Stock gets that kind of money, changes the whole complexion of the game.  The gowing concern is simply a noun reflecting why a company is under duress.  INSEEGO has a multitude of concerns.  However, it does appear that thete might be a light at the end of the tunnel.  Nobody has to write an official letter saying all negatives have been removed.  The stock generally responds to each entity in a positive or negative manner.  Arthur, my main concern now is that you have called yourself the number one lunatic on the message board.  Don&#39;t go too far out in left field.  Have a nice evening."

I’ve never bought any company that has Going Concerns issues before and held it long, why would I? It’s too risky, except for this one because I know , I’m 100% certain, based on its financial improvements, I’m very optimistic it will be removed. If I know it will not be removed, even at $1.60 or .16 cents, it’s lowest sp, I won’t buy it.So it’s understandable that we don’t know the effect of removal of Going Concern for a stock unless you owned NVAX at the time when its Going Concern issues was removed. It went up 400%. Other than this, it’s really hard to believe because either we’ve never seen it before because of rarity and we just don’t pay attention and don’t care about those stocks,The challenge for everyone here is to show this board some facts where Going Concern was removed from a company that is priced or valued at bankruptcy like INSG and the sp tanked or even a non event or even has gone up just 20%-30% gain only after its removal. Let&#39;s see if anyone can mention any stock symbol.I’ve proven it can go up 3 digit gains, give some proof otherwise?"

Analysts are possibly prohibited to tell their clients to invest in any company that has this disclosure. But we all who follow this company very well know that Going Concern will be removed soon. When that happens, analyst will give meaningful upgrades . Expect the volume to rise as well. We, the retail holders are taking the risk now with INSG still having this bankruptcy Going Concern issues because we know Going Concern will be removed one way or the other it iis to our advantage to be invested now which I hope everyone will advantage of.In addition, we know the Brace has already given the best gift to us by divulging the July results as early as the Q2 ER day. He said it will imitate Q1 and Q2 growth, which means as earl as now we can expect again an explosive beat and raise for Q3. This is the safest bet right now because we already have the future information. On top of that, Going Concern will also be removed, this is a double catalyst for the stock and I hope many will take advantage to it."

First, I saw it first hand with NVAX. Secondly, the sudden impact from bankruptcy level sp like INSG to a more normalize pricing based on peers valuation, price to sales ratio, growth rate, etc., short squeeze adding to it, in other words the effect of all these pricing corrections happening in a few days will propel a 3 digit gains just to try to bring it up to a more decent valuation without even fixing the brokenness of this sp still. With NVAX , I saw it jumped 400% gain. Again, this makes sense to me, maybe not for others, the only way to see if it’s true or not is on the day itself.The article today says, this is fairly valued at this price and my answer is yes with the Going Concern still in it which makes sense, because it still considers going bankrupt, with the removal of Going Concern, definitely a big No.Do your dd, don’t take nir trust my word, invest at your own risk."

As the closing of the Convertible Debt Exchanges cannot be assured, accounting guidance requires disclosure that this raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance of these financial statements.&#39;&#39;Look for it to be removed in the next 10Q...as all the exchanges have been closed."

In short Going Concern is the opposite of Growth which we now see in INSG. It’s inevitable that it will be removed."

Arthur, When I buy speculative stocks I look at the positive things going for it to determine if it might be a good buy.  Most volatility usually comes with a tag or going concern.  I don&#39;t believe I have ever seen a stock rise triple digits over the removal of a going concern.  Lots of stocks can pay their bills and function for a long time, but are not growing.  Bottom line, investors want steady, reliable company&#39;s to place their money on.  Share price is the greatest motivator.  If folks think a company is going up, boom!  That simple.  Everyone on this board knows about the Going Concern.  Have a nice day."

Just no reason to sell (not very entertaining but expect a good return over the next year).As a side note...Brace accepting another 12 months as CEO is a pretty clear indicator of when he&#39;s planning to push insiders to sell the company. He knows INSG is set up for large gains in revenue and profit over the next 12 months...perfect time to sell.Just my opinion."

Now we also know Brace sees a continuous momentum for July, the conclusion is this growth is real, and the more new customers and partners come in, revenues, eps, cash flow, Ebitda are just gonna keep growing at rapid phase. I love hearing new customer wins. In essence Brace is giving the investors a hint and a gift that Q3 will most likely have the same growth as Q1 and Q2, so it very safe to get in at this price upto Q3. It’s some sort of a preliminary results for July month, what else can you ask for?nothing to lose but everything to gain."

If the analysts are correct (lower revenue in Q3 than Q2) I would expect this to stay in it&#39;s trading range until news changes the equation (which good or bad...always comes).My personal guess, based on the fact Brace never missed guidance at SWIR, is 55M in revenue and guide to 53M to 57M.Last quarter my guess was spot on concerning their Q1 revenue but I missed by a country mile on their guidance for Q2 (didn&#39;t see that large major carrier order coming)."

Also, at pennies, I’m not so worried with the ups and down of this stock. If we’re on the $30’s and the whole market is acting this way, I would. Bottom line we still have the biggest catalyst no matter what happens to ER day and will be staying here for as long as it takes."
