Yahoo,2024-09-17,"Q for DealWithIt and others: I did some digging into the Last 10 K to figure out how much revenue and earnings does the Telematic business contribute to INSG. Here&#39;s what I could find:For the last year. Telematics revenue is reported as &#34;Services and Other&#34; for a total revenue of $60M. This includes revenue from their SaaS subscriptions too, unfortunately I couldn&#39;t find a breakdown of just Telematics.In the last 10Q their last 6 months revenue called out that &#34;The $4.8 million increase in services and other revenues is primarily due to increased Subscribtion revenues related to the terms of a two-year service contract renewal with a major customer that was effective in April 2024.&#34;Meaning the Subscription revenues must be in the range of at least $10 - $20M. That translates to $40M - $50M. of annual revenues by Telematics? If we consider 35% margins on it, since obviously it&#39;s a profitable business, or it couldn&#39;t be sold for a higher price. Translates to Earnings of $15M. So I think they sold the business at 3 to 4X of their earnings. Sounds like a fair deal! The average seller&#39;s discretionary earnings (SDE) multiple for small businesses is between 1.5x and 4.0x.Now coming back to impact on INSG. Clearly the $52M cash coming in will make INSG debt free. That&#39;s a clean balance sheet no body thought was possible a year ago. Q3 guidance isn&#39;t affected. However in Q4 I feel the quarterly guidance will drop maybe by $7 - $10M as Telematics have exited.Thoughts ??",Neutral,0,0.9368522763252258,Main

The revenue estimates almost certainly will take a hit going forward. I could not find anything in recent ERs pulling out telematics, but I an sure it is not negligible. then I had another thought: I am wondering if they are trimming down the business for an outright sale. Any company interested in INSG&#39;s  5G business would have no interested in a European telematics business , IMO. Time will tell, but I could see the price going either way. Yearly estimates and quarterly revenue will decline. Profits too probably. OTOH they are in a REMARKABLY better financial situation than they were 6 months ago.

Yahoo,2024-08-23,"Some food for thought: I am inviting all the old timers in this stock who have been following this company since 2020, to a healthy conversation and a look back in history for INSG!INSG hit an all time high around $170 towards the end of 2020, before settling down at an overall avg for the year around $80 or $8 pre-split price. So that made me dig through some financials back from 2020. Here&#39;s the summary:2020:Revenues: $315M (This was a peak number, went down following years)Total Debt: $166M (We carried this debt all the way through to 2024)FCF: -$15MOutstanding Shares: 9M (Adjusted)So the company in 2020 had $160+M in debt, it did slightly greater revenues, yet still had negative Cash flow. It still made all time highs?? Anyone care to explain why? Was it just the GME boom time with 0% interest rates? Was it the hope that Wireless devices will do well in Work From Home Environment?2024 Expected:Revenues: $240M+Total Debt: Drastically reduced to below $80M (I believe)FCF: Will be positive $40M+Outstanding Shares: 12MYet we are priced at $12 or $1.2 pre-adjusted.  So my gut tells me Analysts are going to catch up to the fact that INSG numbers are going to look really good soon, and it&#39;s currently not priced in. Even if we give a 50% discount since we are not in Fed Printing money stage.

Or if they did feel generous and seek to make a deal it would have to be to their percentage advantage (like taking 80% or more of the common to settle their debt).That didn&#39;t happen for two reasons.  One, the bond holders were also mostly insiders and would know the potential the Brace brought to the company and the facts the turnaround was close. But there was more.This is from the 10K:&#39;&#39;At December 31, 2023, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (‚ÄúNOLs‚Äù) related to tax years 2021 and prior of approximately $405.1 million. Approximately $106.9 million of these NOLs have no expiration date. The remainder began to expire in 2024, unless previously utilized. Some of these NOLs may be limited by either past or future changes in control events. The Company had California NOLs at December 31, 2023 of approximately $64.2 million, which begin to expire in 2028, unless previously utilized, and foreign NOLs for its active foreign subsidiaries of approximately $25.5 million, which generally have no expiration date.&#39;&#39;",Neutral,0,0.998214840888977,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-18,"Bored so decided to make a post about the value of growth and why it&#39;s so important in valuing stocks.The analysts have been upgrading their estimates for INSG.  For instance 90 days ago they expected INSG to lose about 8 cents a share in 2025 (not EBITDA but GAAP  numbers). Now they expect INSG to earn .26 cents on 229M in revenue (or about 57M a quarter which is basically flat revenue from what they just posted).If they earn 26 cents that a P/E of 50...which is pretty high.But from a P/S (less than 1) and from a EBTDA number (maybe 4X) it&#39;s really cheap.Let&#39;s forget those numbers for a moment and just focus on what happens if they post 4 quarters of 65M in 2025.  Very conservative and reasonable to me.That would give them revenue of 260M rather than the 229M current estimate....or another 30M.Only about an 11% growth rate yet how does that translate to earnings?At 40% margins that extra gives them about 12M in additional earnings (remember, at 229M they already have all their bills covered).If there are 14M shares outstanding (let&#39;s say the 12.12 warrants are exercised) that&#39;s still over 80 cents a share in earnings that go straight to the bottom line.So while revenues only jumped 11% earnings would jump from .26 cents to 1.06.  The P/E would move down from 50 to 11. And that&#39;s why when companies that already break evening or better post solid growth numbers their share prices usually skyrocket (and why analysts end up chasing the share price on the way up).",Positive,1,0.9199519157409668,Main

Once revenue growth of 50% became obvious to the markets and priced it the share price jumped up 4X.In short...growth is a massive factor in figuring the valuation of any stock.In INSG&#39;s case quarterly revenues jumped from 42M to 45M to 59M the last three quarters. Analysts expected it to stay flat around 45M.This is why INSG jumped up 6X and you can no longer buy it for 2 dollars a share.They are also very profitable at current levels.....EBITDA was over 8M last quarter and if you subtract depreciation from their GAAP earnings they would have made about 30 cents a share.So what you are thinking is strong sell overpriced company is really a rapidly growing cash generating machine in the sweet spot of the FWA market.QUANT values growth, margins and cash generation.

Yahoo,2024-08-09,"Here‚Äôs why I stand by my prediction of 3 digit gains when Going Concern is removed. I might be wrong but hopefully I‚Äôm right as everyone will benefit from it. First, I saw it first hand with NVAX. Secondly, the sudden impact from bankruptcy level sp like INSG to a more normalize pricing based on peers valuation, price to sales ratio, growth rate, etc., short squeeze adding to it, in other words the effect of all these pricing corrections happening in a few days will propel a 3 digit gains just to try to bring it up to a more decent valuation without even fixing the brokenness of this sp still. With NVAX , I saw it jumped 400% gain. Again, this makes sense to me, maybe not for others, the only way to see if it‚Äôs true or not is on the day itself.The article today says, this is fairly valued at this price and my answer is yes with the Going Concern still in it which makes sense, because it still considers going bankrupt, with the removal of Going Concern, definitely a big No.Do your dd, don‚Äôt take nir trust my word, invest at your own risk.",Neutral,0,0.659412682056427,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-09,"Just noticed this is the 10Q.&#39;&#39;To mitigate the risk of material shortages and price increases, we enter into non-cancellable purchase obligations with certain key contract manufacturers for the purchase of goods and services in the three to four quarters following the balance sheet date.

As of June¬†30, 2024, our future payments under these noncancellable purchase obligations were approximately $78.2¬†million.&#39;&#39;So why is this significant?Few reasons.First, it shows confidence that they&#39;ll need those materials.Second, the fact a supplier made this arrangement with them means they also have confidence in the company to perform.Third, and most important, the one year time frame matches with the deal Brace just agreed to.....staying as the CEO for another 12 months.If you&#39;re planning to sell the company you don&#39;t want to be locked into long term purchase agreements...that just lowers the valuation (limits the options of the purchasing company thereby lowering the buyout value).",Neutral,0,0.9979835748672485,Main

At this kind of downtrend market, 10Q is our best friend on that day.",Positive,1,0.9999996423721313,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-02,"Mark Wednesday after the close and early Thursday morning to get the reaction to the call.  In this Market, it is going to take an earnings beat with clear profit, along with guidance that will show the ability of INSG to pay its bills.  It does not have to show exadurated growth as some of these Magnificant 7 have to just to please the investor.  INSEEGO is a much smaller entity looking for its fit in this sea of uncertainty.  Nothing but fearful news in the market every day makes it a vicious battlefield. I am thinking that we will be ok if we have our head above water.  Note:  Even the stocks that are out performing are getting brought down after just a couple of days in the green.  The best we can hope for is that Mr. Brace is capable of delivery.  Have a nice 2 day breather, enjoy life.",Positive,1,0.9999774694442749,Main

Yahoo,2024-08-01,"The whole market is going through correction, as we can all see. INSG will go through it as well, the difference, it‚Äôs an upward correction not downward correction. The worst of the worst has already been priced in, bankruptcy and issuance of Going Concern. It can‚Äôt get any worst than this unless INSG discontinues it‚Äôs operation. Also, at pennies, I‚Äôm not so worried with the ups and down of this stock. If we‚Äôre on the $30‚Äôs and the whole market is acting this way, I would. Bottom line we still have the biggest catalyst no matter what happens to ER day and will be staying here for as long as it takes.",Positive,1,0.8706326484680176,Main
Yahoo,2024-08-01,"Under the circustances we could have had a gut wrenching day today.  I am going to take this as a positive.  Many stocks were down well over five per cent.  The market has no idea what to do at the moment; clap for lower rates, brace for an anticipated recession, or sell off and go to money.  If people chose to sell, it is no longer a paper loss, but the real thing.  A lot of fear out there.  We all know what Warren Buffet said, don&#39;t we?",Negative,-1,0.7212461233139038,Main
