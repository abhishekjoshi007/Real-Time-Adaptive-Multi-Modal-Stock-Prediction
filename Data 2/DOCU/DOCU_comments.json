Expect this high year on year revenue growth was driving the high PFCF and with growth dropping over the last 3 years has lead to the large drop in share price. Right now the PFCF is sitting around 12, which I think is cheap if they can keep growing revenue and FCF. If they can keep up the growth, Id expect the share price to increase. Whether it can get back to 250 in the next 5 years will depend on whether they can accelerate their growth and whether you want to wait a bit for it to get to that level."

They read about upcoming earnings, they hear you can get mega rich off options, they read up on some of the companies and then just yolo hundreds or thousands into short term calls. When earnings arrive they then get completely blasted by Theta Burn which in turn will drive the stock price down which will then blow up IV Crush, both feed into itself and ultimately makes the stock price plummet. This has happened with Celsius, Reddit, Hims, you name it. Its only the under the radar stocks that have earnings go well where you see a legitimate climb, like Git Lab most recently."

It hit intraday high of $61.09 and closed up at $59.19 but closed lower the following trading day (it was up against a down market) and hit a post earnings low on September 11 of $54.31.  And here it is 9/26 and up above that earns high at 61.19, hitting $61.94 intraday.  Next target $63.55, the 52 week closing high from January 2024.  And it was $64 in July 22 (ttd intraday high this year is $64.70 but it couldn’t sustain that price).  A long base carving out the right side.  Above that $70s and  a quick ride to $83 price from May 2022.  That was the last leg of the plunge and last time it was above mid 60s, its ceiling for two years.So maybe it gets rejected again from low 60s but it feels like a solid floor has been set.  Rate cuts, mortgage activity up, expenses in check, PE is reasonable."
