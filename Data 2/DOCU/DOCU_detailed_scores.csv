Reddit,2024-09-05,"Dont actively follow DocuSign, but looking at the fundamentals, the Price to Free Cashflow PFCF 3 years ago was over 100 on a trailing 12 month basis. Revenue Growth was over 30 year on year, which I expect was partly due to high uptake in COVID. Expect this high year on year revenue growth was driving the high PFCF and with growth dropping over the last 3 years has lead to the large drop in share price. Right now the PFCF is sitting around 12, which I think is cheap if they can keep growing revenue and FCF. If they can keep up the growth, Id expect the share price to increase. Whether it can get back to 250 in the next 5 years will depend on whether they can accelerate their growth and whether you want to wait a bit for it to get to that level.",Positive,1,0.9435166120529175,Reply
Reddit,2024-09-05,"Im of the personal opinion that the reason why prices have been plummeting post earnings, beating, smashing, or missing, is due to a massive influx of options traders who have no clue what theyre doing. They read about upcoming earnings, they hear you can get mega rich off options, they read up on some of the companies and then just yolo hundreds or thousands into short term calls. When earnings arrive they then get completely blasted by Theta Burn which in turn will drive the stock price down which will then blow up IV Crush, both feed into itself and ultimately makes the stock price plummet. This has happened with Celsius, Reddit, Hims, you name it. Its only the under the radar stocks that have earnings go well where you see a legitimate climb, like Git Lab most recently.",Negative,-1,0.9945642948150635,Reply
