Googles advertising business is 2x as big AND they have 80B a year in revenue from non advertising sources subscriptions cloud which are growing much faster than Ads..., and theyre worth something like1.25X that of Meta. I dont quite understand it tbh, metas advertising business is growing more quickly than googles but googles ad business is 2x as big and their other sources of revenue are growing just as quick if not more quickly than metas ads. I wouldnt be surprised though if meta passes Google in market cap by next year given how much wall street hates Google."

Navitas is currently the only pure play in this field, but any company shifting to it will do. That and silicon carbide. Why? All the amazing things that google, meta and the rest of the magnificent 7 are working on is truly that... Amazing. Except for the fact that these advancements have surpassed the limit in which traditional silicon chips can supply power economically. There are almost no options out there for consumers to drive the next generation of GPUs. Silicon produces too much heat and is not at all efficient at delivering power while switching at high rates. Gallium Nitride will be the pick and shovel industry for the next generation of technology. At a third of the size of Silicon based PSUs, GaN can provide higher throughout 3x worth at lower heat. A smaller form factor means you can scale more in a data warehouse that is tight for space. Companies will save millions on cooling only. Electric vehicles will be able to charge in half the time or less without melting their connectors. Solar panels will be able to convert and store energy more efficiently increasing power collected and driving down cost. Its like the rest of the world created the fastest engines ever but the tire industry is just starting to develop the technology needed for those engines to go full speed. GaN is already showing up in many places including hundreds of smart phones and mobile charges. EVs and solar is moving towards it. I expect a lot of these companies to be acquired honestly but if youre excited about where GPUs and machine learning is going, keep an eye on its biggest handicap right now, and that is power consumption and our inability to deliver it. Were still in the euphoria stage of ML discovery but when it becomes fully integrated in our lives, it will drive the price up of these companies drastically."

And has failed to gain enough interest to really turn the price around since then, with one run that hit about 1.20ish. Price closed at 0.5758 Friday, and unfortunately they just got the notice that they need to regain compliance by March 24th, 2025 this date may be off a little bit, but it is definitely in March 2025. That being said, they are an ebikeescooteremotorcycle sales, rental, and repair company that has also branched out and started a delivery service centered in NYC. Why is it important that I mention NYC you might ask? Well because NYC is quite literally forcingaggressively incentivizing micromobility public transit adoption, actively trying to rid the city of traditional vehicles, semitrucks and even delivery vans, now beginning to implement lastmile delivery ebike delivery to their final destination from microhubs strategically placed throughout the city. But it isnt only New York thats doing this, this is a worldwide effort acrossed multiple cities and countries. USDOT themselves are backing this transition as youll see in the links below. How theyre doing this is too long to explain here, but links to all of the research Ive posted will be below. There is plenty more to come but I havent organized the information and posted yet. All of it is on stocktwits, seriously check the research I think youll be surprised.

With the recent changes in law around how real estate agents get paid, the relentless shortage in housing, and ppl not wanting to get out of their rock bottom mortgage rates they refinanced during covid, first time home buyers are going to continue to get priced out of buying a home. Renting continues to be the cheaper option and demand is on the rise due to this. Appf has a very scalable product that they have decent market share in already that I think will continue to grow. I use the product myself and it is fantastic. Only thing that might hold it back is the election if you think the home buyer incentives will go through if the Dems win, and falling interest rates making it easier for construction companies to finance new projects."

It would currently be way, way, WAY too expensive to scale LLMs to handle this. Chat gpt lets paying users do like what, 20 queries a week? And their user base is tiny. To suggest that chat gpt has the infrastructure to even become a legitime competitor to Google is pretty ridiculous right now. Maybe when they stop rate limiting their user base that idea could have some merit, but I dont see that happening anytime soon. Even with the compute and inference costs decreasing exponentially, to even SUGGEST that any LLM is CLOSE right now to being able to handle 50k queries per second is pretty laughable and even if it were realistic, chatbots are not reliable sources of information... So they need to be supplemented with Google or something similar. Not to mention that Googles core business and search traffic are growing, so that 50k number is a moving target, and could easily be 100k in 5 years given the secular trend of smartphone adoption in the developing world... Which is dominated by Android. Remind me who owns Android again?. There is no evidence that chat gpt is threatening search as far as Im aware.

They settled on what now is Navitas as the technology was just starting to be integrated commercially. The infusion was something over a billion dollars initially so they were cash rich. The officers of the company chose deferred shares as salary too to minimize the hit on cash reserves. They had been growing some 6070 YoY which kept the high valuation going. But this year, markets slowed and chip manufactures got hit hard, so they stalled on revenue growth adding concerns for a dilution in the short term. That seems possible for navitas but next year and forward is looking completely different. Since its new tech, they are inventing and innovating on the fly so it takes some time to deliver design wins like a year or two. Starting late this year and forward a lot of those design wins are coming to fruition. they are beginning their deliveries to AWS and Google data warehouses, converters to solar which was hit hard but on the up and up now, and more residential power devices like fridges, kitchen gadgets and laptop chargers. Whoever has the best IP here will be set up for the future. Looking forward to getting back to the 5060 YoY growth. Also much of Europe is starting to go solar and electric. The demand will be high for equipment that can provide the best power."

They let Amazon capture digital and weathered it, which makes me worried it will make them complacent. Sure, they may say AI and automation in the press, and they might even try. But they could just be riding the buzzword wave and choose to shutter it all when the next buzzword tech comes along, gutting acquisitions and locking up IP from competitors. Walmart is the furthest thing from a startup mentality. Top to bottom, its employees are the opposite of startup mentality. They thought mobile order and pickups were a fad that would leave after covid and if not for covid, would never have attempted to seriously move into the area Amazon was dominating if not for a global catastrophe. The only thing WM ever did that was innovative was when they created the allinone superstore. Since then, theyve been riding the wave of, we exist and offer convenience...where else are you going to go? Which is fine, but thats not growth stock mentality."

If you havent looked at the research, Ive posted give it a look. Off the top of my head this is what I know without referring to the research. New York is reducing traffic lanes to make dedicated bus and bike lanes in their place and have been aggressively doing this, offering tax breaks, incentives, eliminating cheaper competition by removing nonUL compliant ebikes from the streets, implementing a tradein program that the company is participating in so people can get cheaper access to UL Compliant ebikes, shutting down 1 to 2 blocks of traffic lanes around several schools to implement green spaces. Theyre also doing the microhub thing for Delivery, installing Charging stations in public spaces dedicated specifically for this companys loyal customer base delivery workers, adding programs designed to specifically remove vehicles from the streets ghost cars, and installing surveillance systems on busses and at bus stops that automatically ticket drivers etc.. The city has capped speed limits acrossed the entire city to 25mph, Outside of highwaysinterstates They essentially are using our countrys past to gain support from underserved communities with a plan to Reconnect communitys that were divided by the states addition of highwaysinterstates decades ago. Their sanctuary city status that brings in illegal immigrants has directly boosted the sales and services of this companys products and continues to do so. Working on removing free public parking spaces for vehicles and installing bike parking. All of the above and any other information Im forgetting has heavily increased travel times and congestion for people driving traditional vehicles traffic was already bad in NY before this, but this just made it several times worse, which New York is using to implement Congestion Pricing a tolltax on gas vehicle traffic that ranges from 7 to 15 per use of the roads in the areas covered by the Congestion Pricing zone ebikes and buses are obviously exempt from this and there is a hearing regarding it on 1015. All of that isnt even including the activists who have been protesting, blocking traffic lanes, publically shaming tradional drivers etc., support from other companies for example Con Edison which is offering to install free ebike charging stations in underserved communities etc.. Then when you look at the company themselves they have since inception in 2017 I believe expanded to around 40ish retail stores mostly in New York, but also acrossed many other densely populated cities with an influx of migrants, most of which are cities that are following New Yorks lead, just at a slower pace, funded by the federal government. Notably, Philadelphia is expected to have a lot of illegal immigrants and are currently seeing expansion in their delivery services. FLYE is already there and is established in the delivery community, as they took feedback from delivery workers in NY and changed their bikes to meet the delivery workers needs this whole time another ebike company that has seen growth in NY has seen that Philadelphia is going through the same and just within the last month or so have expanded to take advantage of this as well. The company is already on the stock exchange ahead of popular brands like Trek and Surron, i have to look a little deeper but pretty sure FLYE as a company is performing better than Harley Davidsons emotorcycle brand Live Wire, has better earnings, profitability, and less debt than other publicly traded ebike companies etc. Theyve expanded to include a delivery service of their own, they are completing their apps, and offering a renttoown program that will be less expensive 6.60day than paying the Congestion Toll that will likely be implemented in NYC and California which theyre also located in in the very near future. I could probably go on, but this is already an entire book."

Edit also when it jumped from 300 to like 400 something that was purely based on sales, the earnings report was so amazing it reflected how jndervalued the company was at the time, theres just a relatively small AI premium too now so thats why I still think its fair, I think nvidia for example is priced like this purely because of AI and a little because of projected growth and I think metas main valuation vomes from their great sales theyve had and the huge share theyre getting from advertising"

I actually did mention that the cost of compute And inference is decreasing exponentially, but Google search query traffic is also growing, its a moving target. And as you can see above, the best models which are still really bad and hallucinate often such as o1 ARE rate limited despite a tiny user base. So yea the cost of compute has gone down but serving SOTA models is always going to be drastically more expensive than answering queries in the way Google does it. And no I dont see how an LLM becomes a better way to interact with search. Theyre fundamentally unreliable and slow. By the way, LLM cannot interact with the internet by itself ... It needs to be integrated with another app to do that such as a search engine. Good for your wife I guess?

Waymo, pixel, pixel buds, etc, even throw Gemini in there if you want as its obvious that Googles AI has improved rapidly look at how bad Palm 1 is vs Gemini 1.5 pro 002...

But with the prices its at now, theyd have to be complete garbage to continue the path down. Myself and my coworkers theyre deep value specialists, its their job believe that even on poor earnings this should shoot up. Theyre still profitable. Theyre slowly closing unprofitable stores which is 25 of them and theyre due for a turnaround. The divvy is huge and was cut last year but they wont cut it again. Even if they cut it in half, that would make it 7 still. Theres just so much bad sentiment surrounding the company and theyre NOT going bankrupt. Theres a few reason.

The way the metaverse was pushed was not a good business move. spending 40 billions in a super short amount of time 2 years on a metaverse that sees no use there are reports of a daily user activity of 40 and even started having negative headlines about unmoderate rooms where childs and sexual harassment is mixed together and super dorkey graphics is not working out. The technology isnt there yet or wasnt there maybe soon avaiable for consumer in like 23 years to even start having the envisioned use. I know meta and other companies push the verse. Microsoft is apparently focusing on work enviorment. Apple basically said they couldnt care less about the metaverse. And meta kinda abandoned the idea for now guess they are waiting for the technology to catch up. So instead of pushing the metaverse in 2021 where you are not planning to use it till 2030 is kinda wonkey, espacially if you cut major parts of the spending in the years until then. Usually you should ramp up the spendings till release, not the other way around I know I dont really think the dream of one metaverse is going to work out. The idea of seperate enviorments could work maybe. Yet what meta will try to do is push it hard. They wanna profit on ads in your virtual living room. And on a ton of assets they purchase. Dont really think that sounds appealing to all people not for me atleast, but I guess a few people will try to get virtual gucci balenciaga stuff in the metaverse to flex around. So it might work but yea, that is not really what businesses are after I guess"

Compared to LLY it seems like this company is more focused and leaner, which to me seems like a plus. It can be but thats often an it is until it isnt imo its great when the theme in question is big but the moment others start to become competitive Id be surprised if a large pharma co wo obesity exposure doesnt eventually buy VKTX andor trials start disappointing, the name is going lower.

I think of it as them testing which one performs best overall. I agree on how being leaner isnt necessarily a good thing all the time. 40 of LLYs revenue comes from obesity and diabetes medication versus around 75 for NVO. All to say a sizable chunk of revenue for both companies is in this segment. But to be fair most of LLYs profit comes actually from other drugs. When it comes to companies like Viking Therapeutics my opinion is theyd still run into capacity problems that the bigger manufacturers are running into. In that regard I cant see it eating into LLY and NVOs sales."

To me it seems like election year virtue signaling. You have a regulatory body asking why unregulated drug list pricing is so high. Its their job to add regulations so that theres a cap. Practically every other country does, we dont and politicians at this point choose not to. In the case of obesity and diabetes PBMs drive up list prices during negotiations so they can get favorable rebates. PBMs are middlemen that are also publicly traded like Cigna and CVS so they stand to lose more performance wise if they dont keep those prices high. NVO could slash prices and still keep a very healthy margin and potentially even sell more volume, but if they dont agree to PBM list prices they risk getting removed from their formularies which means lower sales all together and people not getting medication from NVO. Its one major factor not all that causes the price of diabetes and obesity medication to be so high in the US but low everywhere else."

They have an oral medication thats only a shortterm treatment, and its not a compounded medication so it would be less effective than your traditional GLP1. Plus from what I understand its 2400 upfront for a year or something like 250400 per month. Being noncompounded its not as effective and not intended to be a long term treatment. So it doesnt work for everyone and I dont think its covered by insurance. In that regard it sounds like a niche market. It should be noted that none of what it sells is FDA approved. Not sure if this would really affect their oral medications. As for the GLP1 HIMS recently began offering, this would be compounded and can be a longer term treatment, but my understanding is theyre only allowed to sell this in the first place because theres a shortage right now. Ifwhen Nordisk ends its shortage on GLP1s I think the FDA at that point would demand HIMS to pull GLP1s from their shelves. So yes, they do have that loophole to sell without approval because of the shortages, but at the same time we dont even know if HIMS is violating patents or is unsafe and ineffective as far as their GLP1s go. Personally, Im not a fan of tossing someone desperate to lose weight who took a 10 minute survey and never talked to a doctor some drugs to inject into themselves. Dont know if when all is said and done FDA approved GLP1 makers or the FDA would be okay with this either so IMO its sounding real risky."

Im just trying to understand why it seems the market is treating Nordisk as losing in this race when so far its future in this specific space looks brighter in terms of efficacy and production growth prospects.

The shelf space gives them an advantage against other start ups but is still tied to their own performance and bigger brands can still just substitute old products with new ones and be an immediate treat due to the low entry barrier. 23 of the category sales is through retail, so ecommerce is also not that important for snacksbars I would be really cautious about your assumption of a health conscious consumer. While I would agree that healthier eating is on the raise it doesnt mean plant based alternatives are also winning. Actually we know from trails at McDonalds and the evolution of plant based brands like Oatly that the demand might be limited. Simply Good Food does seem to be managed well as they are decreasing debt while increasing margins but for a growth stock the falling revenue growth is still a warning sign. Which seems to be reflected in the current stock performance. In general, I dont see a point in creating a 20 year strategy with single stocks. What might be a good stock now can be seen completely different in the 510 years because of bad management, macroeconomics, regulatory changes or consumer behavior shifts. If you believe in the category its probably more of an ETF or managed funds opportunity."

Too many people still treating the EV theme like its the 202021 bubble and trying to pick the next Tesla. Meanwhile, a number of 202021 EV ipospac names are already 0s some of which are 0s for the second time. The automobile business with a couple of exceptions is not a great business I mean, again multiple EV companies that went public a few years ago already 0s and Tesla made everyone think it is, despite Musk frequently going on about what a difficult business it is over the years. So, can RIVN bounce? Sure. Is it going lower if there was a recession in the next couple years? Absolutely. Do I think it can be one of the few smaller names that ultimately gets through this period? Yes, but I think the market has gone back to the idea that automobiles are not a great business and people keep wanting them to be something they arent. So, I think RIVN could bounce on any good news, its going to be a tough hold through whenever the next recession is and on the other side of that will probably do fine on the upturn but I think people still expect too muchis it the next TSLA!?!?! from the theme."

I heard battery might be commoditized .. so maybe battery recycling. Think what changes in the car architecture.. more motors more copper more high voltage electric lines and interconnects .. companies like molex amphenol comes to mind. Then semiconductors that focus on power conversions and controls like nxp infineon renesas will also win irrespective of who sells more EV. Then there are utility companies which should see more demand along with data centers. There is massive work in EV infrastructure and charging but again focus on the vendors and not necessarily blink or charge point. Along with ev.. there will be a shift to automation .. the players making the cameras lidar chips and software would make more profit than waymo Tesla or gm who are competing to bring the vehicles. It doesnt mean that Rivian or Tesla is a bad investment but its no longer a first mover environment... I have no idea of knowing if they will or will not but if I trust that EV is going to be the future.. then I would bet on the supply chain. Solar might be a big winner in EV . Not so much in data center case. Think ancillary issues... Charging time is still a problem... Land is limited... You want chargers in strategic location. Who has land that might become useless with ev chargers.. think the gas stations... So they will transition there with scope of commercial real estate developing. Else the grid will transition to micro grid with battery storage becoming more critical."

So realistically, it isnt cutting into their bottom line as much as it sounds because VW still has audi and several other brands that are rebounding the loss from bugatti. But rivian is selling to the general public an EV that they claim is competitive to tesla, and announving that they are losing 32,000 per vehicle, which granted, from q4 23 losing 43k to now theyre reducing that number sure, but thats still per car world wide.

As the saying goes do not trust an internet stranger. If you like the ideas.. do your own research and share your ideas too. Just note I have a very long time window in investing and generally buy a company and dont sell even if it goes through a downturn.. right now I have large losses in Albemarle and SEDG and many solar companies but I hold them.. I believe its gonna be a rough ride but long term people will migrate to solar and now nuclear too. Similarly .. people will transition to EV but its going to take time to do so.

If more people do it, the lines are longer and the service becomes less valued. Do they have space to add more lines in airports or are they limited by the space available? The Clear lines are longer than the regular lines, with correspondingly longer wait times, one travel influencer wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, during the peak of holiday travel. Why should I pay to wait longer to get through airport security? The value just isnt there any more. From reddit thread on Clear vs TSA precheck CLEAR is actually terrible if you already have TSA precheck Standard CLEAR experience Enter the line Wait for the people before you struggle with the machine reader Get guided along by a guide Take off my glasses for retina scan Eye scan doesnt work, try again 23 times Open my phone and scan bording pass Boarding pass awkwardly doesnt scan.

Agent guides me to a new machine Gets even more annoyed, be adamant that the agent gives me back my ID Agent gives me back ID Go to regular TSA precheck. Standard TSA precheck experience. Enter the line, wait 30 seconds Give them only your ID most airports no longer need to show boarding pass Proceed to bag check Also from that thread That said, Ive considered dropping CLEAR even though I have a credit card which covers its annual cost. Said credit card is the only reason Ive kept CLEAR. As a former employee who left on my own volition, I can assert that CLEAR is more dogshit to work for than even Walmart. Theyre absolutely terrible to their employees, and many of the employees they hire seem to be miserable and impolite to begin with. _____________________________________ Theres a lot of nonairport possibilities with the service, none of which have been advanced much since the IPO it feels like."

In reality, you could choose any strike price for either one of them depending on how bullish of bearish you are. If hes really bullish for example and wanted to sell puts, he could sell a put 10 above the current price of the stock.

Mine cost me 5000 after the insurance pays their share, and theyre several years old now. The insides have been upgraded replaced once already but I cant afford a full replacement. The battery lasts a full week of daytime use, and programming is part of the service the doctor provides, so I cannot customize it. I do, however, have copies of all my hearing tests for the last 10 years, so I can see how it has changed and can extrapolate reasonably well. Plus, Apple claims theyll provide a hearing test feature. If Apple provides all those same frequencies, it would be truly game changing. The Airpods Pro 2 are ungainly and only last 6 hours, but for about 250 each I could afford to buy two pair and charge one while wearing the other pair, then swap out when theyre spent. Given culture the way it is today, I can get away with wearing them anywhere, too. Plus, listening to music on them would be a far better experience than anything my current hearing aids can do since they require a loop necklace antenna and buggy bluetooth sync to work today. That will be a huge win for Apple right there. Finally, I could easily build a set of microphones to feed into the Airpods. I work with Raspberry Pi and IoT all the time, so assembling and programming a microphone array would not take more than a month for me. I could build myself a custom necklace that would really amp up my hearing all around and allow me to program which air heard the result to custom effect. I cant wait to try it out!

It has been in the works in the industry for a couple of years, every single earphone company is working on it. Gn resound had something like this a year back. But why now? US FDA changed regulations around sharing aids sometime in 2019 or so, and they allowed hearing aid to be sold over the counter. This enabled consumer companies like Apple to roll this out. So, is the apple one any good? Not really. Its a gimmick. Why? Apple AirPods only last 67 hours with a single charge and continuous playback hearing aid feature is effectively continuous playback mode. This is not usable for most people. Medical grade hearing aids last 34 days with one battery. You dont want grandma worrying about charging her AirPods every 6 hours and sit down for an hour for it to charge without hearing. This is why traditional hearing aids last multiple days. This is a nothing burger. They already had the transparency mode, which passes through external sounds to the ear. Hearing Aid mode is basically amplifying it and playing it louder, with some additional minor challenges. If you are looking for Apple and health, this aint it. Apple HealthKit is more promising. More and more medical grade devices now integrate with Apple HealthKit and their fertility tracking etc is getting really really good. Recently, FDA allowed Dexcomm to sell their continuous glucose monitor directly to customers and dexcom is now working with Apple HealthKit giving Apple glucose data from users. This is a medical grade FDA cleared device used by millions of people who are diabeticpre diabetic . Source myself, an electrical engineer who used to design hearing aids for a living"

Inflation will normalize it for the sidelines. On top of the fact that the biggest argument against Apple is already the cost, so I dont know why you thought this would do anything. Deaf people in the market for a new hearing aid is not exactly a massive market to switch nonApple people into new Apple people. It is an important and altruistic market for someone to reach, but in this case its not going to move things significantly for a long time, and since were talking about Apple, it will probably look like part of a normal broad increase as they also continue to improve other areas of their business.

For travel she might even toss three into her bag. The cost is negligible compared to closing a single deal and her company allows her to expense them as a consumable. If you use them heavy they last about 18mo or so before needing to be trashed due to battery wear. For 190pair average cost we pay because we stock up during sales its really not a big deal compared to a medical device. The only secret sauce here is software. Apple could run laps around the existing players if they decided to do so in that arena. Ive met some of the programmers for such companies it wont even be a competition.

How is it that IBRXs accumulated deficit of 3.2 billion is more than half of SoonShiongs net worth, if he didnt deliberately saddle it with debt Im not saying he did Im just asking? 2. If IBRX only has enough cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through at least 12 months, doesnt that mean a share dilution is very likely in the near future? Wouldnt IBRX be cutting things a bit close if they dont do it within the next 3 months? 3. The stock price is lower today than it was when the FDA approval was given. What does this mean for sales? Does it for example mean that other drugs are being preferred, over Anktiva? Does it mean that Anktivas efficacy has been exaggerated, since its not effective on its own but has to be taken alongside BCG? 4. Which other drugs are competing with Anktiva in the treatment of NMIBC, and how do their sales compare with those of Anktiva? 5. Are there any official dates or timelines by which UK approval is expected? 6. You say his plane has been at Heathrow Airport for this month. Is it likely that he is pushing for UK approval, so he can then announce some shares dilution?"

Trials are extremely expensive, I believe 505k 150k per participant., depending on the type of drugtreatment. 2. Yes. Share dilution is possible. However, it is my opinion the will partner to create liquidity. Soon owns 80 of the stock, so he has in interest too. 3. Look at Akebia, Iovance, Coherus, Xfor and others that had PDUFAapproval. Approval means nothing, IBRX was in the luxury position of being able to ship 2 weeks after approval. Unique. However, the market still needs to be informed, trained, insurance deals covered. An approval, as with the given examples, are in indication of future value. Especially when it does not concern Big Pharma. 4. Keytruda and Opdivo I believe. If you look at Opdivo wiki, you can see a approval path I think Anktiva has the same timeline. 5. UK is my guess. Not fact. It is simply logic. The fastest to obtain. 6. UK approval, in my opinion, will go with a partnership. I do not see how they can not. If they do not partner, they will need to dilute. With Bio stock anything is possible. You have to be willing to see red. A partner can bee in many forms, but if this occurs there will be a big investment my guess 500,000,000 minimum and hefty milestone payments for each indication."

If by bio business you mean biotechs as a whole, well nobody is ever going to be familiar with all of them, and each biotech has its own idiosyncracies and unique selling points. Therefore, we ALL need to read about bio business. Also, as far as getting familiar is concerned, asking questions here is actually part of getting familiar with the sector and learning more about it. Nobody has a monopoly on knowledge. 2 Big Pharma and biotechs are not the same thing. A financial win for a Biotech company may barely move the financial needle for a Big Pharma company thats worth multiples of billions, depending on the amount of sales of the drug. If a biotechs drug is not the only drug on the market for a given illness, the money made from that drugs market share will be limited, since the Total Addressable Market will be shared with the competing drugs. There are also drugs that most of the public who need them will never see, due to the unfortunate fact that those drugs are too expensive to be massproduced for the wider market. 3 A companys revenue is very different from its stock price action. Even when a drug is sold to the public, it isnt guaranteed to translate to significant stock price increase. If a biotechs stock price doesnt move much, then that biotech isnt attractive to private investors, even if it remains desirable for a big pharma company to invest in it."

Also Schwab has locked people out of their accounts twice this year already which never happened to me before on any other brokerage. The only reason I am using Schwab is because I really liked TD Ameritrade and they were purchased by Schwab this year so I didnt really have a choice. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and you can still use the ThinkorSwim platform with Schwab so that is something that I dont want to give up. I am crossing my fingers hoping they will get better because I would really rather avoid switching brokerages and having to learn a new skill set for trading. If I were to move I might choose Chase, but I have heard that Fidelity is also a good choice. Good luck with whatever you decide! Edit I wanted to add that another thing I do like about Schwab is that you can trade in afterhours premarket, set up as many automatic orders as you want with no fees for equity tradesnot options, and I can spend twice as much money as I actually have if I want to not sure if that is a good thing or not...lol."

Schwab holds this cash for an extra day and pays out a day later. 3 Schwabs site experienced 3 crashes at the open when I was looking to trade. Never had a problem with Fidelity in the 10 years I have had an account with them. 4 My account contacts at Fidelity are great and take care of things within days of requesting. My account rep at TD Ameritrade was awesome and moved over to Schwab. He is super frustrated by them due to their poor performance and inability to compete with other brokerage firms as they are not competitive. 5 Schwab only allows a single phone number for two factor authentication. Fidelity allows two phone numbers to be set up to access an account via two factor authentication. I want both my wife and myself to be able to access accounts in case something happens to the other spouse.

Gross services volume is basically the same as it was a year ago. Revenue is only up because they keep increasing the take rate. 19 of what the clients pay now goes to UpWork. Their revenue guidance for Q3 is less than what they made in Q2. So they might enter a phase of negative growth now. Caused by declining usage which cannot be offset by further increasing the take rate. They keep focussing on enterprise deals and neglect the marketplace experience. Although the marketplace is the 6x bigger business. Clients who use the marketplace still get 3 ! invoices and receipts per week ! even if they just work with one freelancer. Who wouldnt want to add 19 to their freelancer cost and the hassle to add 12 documents per month to their tax paperwork? TlDr They focus on their sales team, neglect the product, make it more and more expensive, usage growth declines. They still have a great starting point as the market leader in work marketplaces. But unless they change the approach, I think nothing will come out of it. If the business slips away, my hope is that a new, more product oriented CEO will come into play."

Average spent per buyer is 4x smaller on Fiverr compared to UpWork. When you commission a onetime job like a logo, it doesnt matter if you pay 100 or 130. That wont make you take the job off the platform. But when you work with a freelancer on a constant basis, you start to think about why you pay UpWork every month too. Because the only thing you get for it is the invoicing.

And with the guidance of 6 revenue for Q3, it stands to be expected that usage will start shrinking now. Despite over a hundred million Dollars spent on sales and marketing per year. My interpretation UpWorks service is good at the beginning of the user journey. To match buyers and sellers. But then it becomes a chore. Because of the weekly invoice cycle and the separate invoicing from sellers and UpWork. That makes it an 8x worse solution than direct seller to buyer invoices. UpWork gained a massive amount of users during covid. And now those users abandon the service. Its a long way down to precovid levels. It can make the business decline for years. On the upside, UpWork might have the potential to become as big as the other market place leaders. Amazon, Uber, Booking, AirBnB, Shopify etc are all orders of magnitude larger than UpWork and I dont see a reason the leading work market place shouldnt become as big as those. But I think that would require a shift in the way UpWork is run. As the current approach to growth is not working. As can be seen in the numbers."

As for the user growth, it isnt actually declining. The of active clients is growing. Last year, they announced a change in their fee structure. It used to be multitier 20, then 10, then 5. So, the larger the contract, the lower the fee UpWork takes. The new structure is a flat 10 fee for all. I do think some contracts were taken outside of UpWork, which led to a reduction in the average spend per client which is reflected in the Gross service volume decline. I do think this is temporary, as with any price increase decision made."

So I dont see a reason to think that is a seasonal effect. In 2023Q2 it was 0.6. In 2022Q2 it was 1.77. So basically what the number tells us is that they lost more clients in 2024Q2 than they won in 2023Q2. Still, the 6 active clients YoY look kinda good, so if those would be the only numbers we have QoQ and YoY, I would say I dont know what to think. Lets wait until next quarter. But we also have the guidance of 6 in revenue QoQ. The worst guidance in the history of UpWork. And they explain it with negative trends in the topoffunnel which could mean active clients or spent per client I think and expect it to continue We did see those trends get slightly worse in June and July And they talk about working on anticircumvention efforts in the call. You can find it in the transcript. Which should mean they will try to stop buyers and sellers from leaving the platform once they have found each other. Why would they have to do that if their users wanted to use the invoicing service they provide? The users dont want it. I dont think you can grow a business by saying We have a good service and a bad service. We give you a good service for a few days and then well force you to use our bad service forever."

Unemployment is actually due to overly robust growth and not enough people to fill positions. The US is still very strong and corporate earnings, which have been mostly excellent, have shown that too. A soft landing is still intact. We are still in a secular bull market and the market cycle is still supportive of further upside.

Employees work for less at Amazon because the environment is significantly better than CVS.

If you want cheap Ill offer some recs that Ive been looking at Banking MFC 9 Forward PE and 4.84 dividend. TD 9.5 forward PE and 5.3 dividend. TFC I own already and has an 11 forward PE and 5.1 dividend. All three have been pretty beat up bc of the rate hikes and real estate issues, but all have solid financials and can make a good comeback. TFC is also unwinding their commercial real estate and making better investments. Consumer ASO with a 7 PE and 1 dividend, LOW and HD with a 18 and 20 PE and 2.02.6 div. A couple random companies EOG 10 PE and 3 div. AER that has a beautiful 5.8 PE and 1.1 dividend. Honorable mention to SBUX a higher 20 PE and 3 div"

A single digit PE like CVS is much less demanding. The question for the stock is how successful they will be at recovering their margins, if they can, then the valuation will jump, and investors will get a substantial dividend while they wait."

They are rushing M4 to compete against not Qualcomm, but Intel. Which will have a similar chiplet style like Apple. And on chip power delivery to get that battery life up past 8 hours and it will likely run cool and compete with them on all fronts. Intel has working silicon for their 18A which is 1.8 NM, and its coming in 1st half. They will be a foundry by 2027. TSMC could barely get 3nm going. No competition and constant misses. So lets this sink in for a bit. They literally have an Apple silicon answer and an ARM answer. They are literally building foundries with technology that TSMC is frantically trying to catchup on and is 6 months behind for onboard power delivery for example. And x86 is widely compatible and companies will eat it up. Cutting bloated staff, got 8 billion from the govt to see to this plan through etc. And telegraphed and told us it would be a rough quarter. The 13th and 14th gen is the only woldcard that is driving emotions high for an over represented group of edgy gamers who upgrade their CPUs every 24 years. They just tacked on a 2 year extended warranty. Move on. Its just not rational this doom and gloom stance. Logical people are being drowned out by people heavy into Nvidia and who know nothing about the actual products and how it is beyond competitive. Remember Jensens biggest fear. This is a cut throat industry and Intel is very much primed to take share in the coming years. It would be suicide to bet against them IMO."

Glad I did, because its never gone back up since outside of a hedge fund pump and dump simply to convince the masses to buy the deal before they shed their losses despite Intel doing nothing wrong up to recently, and theyre not going anywhere. A cantankerous old man once said you dont need a formal conspiracy when interests converge and I think were seeing that with the market of today. To the moon, right? This bubble is too big to possibly burst, because its the new normal to be overvalued because PE doesnt mean anything since they can get more investors for the next hypetrain. Well... those AI companies are hemorrhaging money, billions, and what happens when those investors come knocking? Well, like we saw today, those who have shared interest will signal to buy at a discount and then opportunistically sell off in afterhours. Public sentiment is bad because a lot of people lost money by thinking line always go up, yet it never did. Besides the nonsense of the modern market, Intel is the one who will support the US when the inevitable happens across the pacific, and public sentiment will change when nobody can get their precious AI chips. The investors are starting to see that AI burns more money than it generates, is projected to burn more, and still hallucinates wildly limiting its usefulness. Metrics dont matter anymore, the market is dominated by converged interests and Intel will remain in the gutter regardless of their news until something sticks, like an issue in the East, and the masses converge and change their tune to its a bargain."

They would be incentivized to extract more value from dvr customers by charging them or make it so you cant skip the commercials. Dvr is gonna be looked back on like this funny in between moment in time. Not as dramatic but reminds me a little of the Napster limewire eras. We knew something needed to change but the business hadnt adapted yet so we get this in between moment thats great for customers."

Nope gotta send an 4th and sacrifice ann entire tv set to replace the door. 4th arrives and the wood door had a manufacturing flaw where one door was cut about an inch shorter that the other. It was a mess, and having to return the set each time wasnt easy as it was a two person job to move the box.

In 2007, GDP growth was about 1.9 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA. Recent Years 2023 GDP growth has varied in recent years due to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and subsequent recovery. For example, in 2021, GDP grew by about 5.7, driven by recovery from the pandemic, but this growth rate has moderated since then, with GDP growth in 2023 estimated to be around 2 to 2.5. 2007 Wage growth was relatively stagnant before the recession. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS, real wage growth was minimal, with nominal wages increasing modestly but often outpaced by inflation. GDP Growth The growth rate of GDP in 2007 was lower compared to some recent years, especially during the postpandemic recovery. However, recent growth rates are beginning to resemble the moderate growth seen in 2007 as the economy stabilizes. Wage Growth Real wage growth has been more pronounced recently due to labor market pressures, but inflation has also been higher, which complicates direct comparisons. In 2007, wage growth was weaker, with stagnant real wages being a concern leading up to the recession. Recent Years 2023 Wage growth has been more dynamic in recent years, partly due to labor shortages and inflation pressures. In 2022, nominal wages increased by about 5 on average, though real wage growth adjusted for inflation has been mixed. Some quarters saw real wage declines due to high inflation, while other periods showed modest real gains. Deregulation of the financial industry led to those GOP caused recessions, then we need to either reinstate the regulations they repealed or make new ones, they hurt us more than help us every time they hold the presidency."

Thats not a robust argument. Recessions dont just appear out of nowhere. We typically start with a robust looking, heated economy and very low unemployment, and then hey! Unemployment rises, bankruptcies spike and consumption falls over. This is the business cycle. If we trigger the sahm rule in the next couple of employment reports, and or the yield curve steepens further, Im sorry, historically speaking it would be pretty much unprecedented to not have a recession.

Youre already ahead of the game just by being aware of things like valuations, AI hype, and macro trends. I get where youre coming from with the fear of buying at the topits a valid concern, especially with how things feel right now. But the truth is, trying to time the market perfectly is insanely hard, even for professionals. A lot of people sat on the sidelines waiting for a crash after 2020, and missed huge gains. One approach I like is a hybrid of your options, continue dollar cost averaging DCA, but maybe adjust the amount based on market conditions. For example, if the market does drop, you can accelerate your buys. On the flip side, when things feel overheated, keep it slow and steady, like you said with 20kyear. This way, youre not sitting on the sidelines forever, but also not dumping everything in at once. I also think trimming your SPYQQQ positions isnt a bad call if it aligns with your risk tolerance. Maybe shift a bit more into value stocks, bonds, or even international ETFs. That way, youre a little more diversified if a correction or downturn happens. IJust remember that, while recessions are inevitable, time in the market usually beats trying to perfectly predict the timing."

Plus ordinary income rates on all of it vs. preferential capital gains and qualified dividend rates for a significant portion of it? Ill take the preferential rates. Im all for and will take some Roth dollars and pay my pittance currently, but why would I load up and defer for all those years so that I get it in the shorts on the back end at ordinary income rates? I value flexibility in my ability to use my dollars more than anything else. I lose that flexibility when I shovel funds into the IRA. Im not going to let tax dictate what I want to do, and can maneuver to a place that I am comfortable with the consequence. I also dont have forced RMDs like with an IRA, I get basis setupup to my kid for any inheritance, I dont have a forced 10 year liquidation of assets like with an IRA when inherited. Again, I value my flexibility over all else, and the ability to use funds when I dictate, not wait until Im 5912 if I dont want to, or be forced into some other situation that may not be preferential for what my goals are. My end game is to have a brokerage account that generates a sufficient amount of income annually that supports my life so I have the option to work or not, and allows me to do the things that I want to do. Maybe I want to travel and volunteer at national parks and just hike all day real possibility that I may do, pack up and possibly move part of the year when my kid is older and decides to attend college somewhere buy a rental and make money with this likely, add to the rentals that I already have as well, do some side gig work to stay busy, or whatever it may be. But if im 50 and this takes place, know what kind of investment makes this more difficult to achieve? pretax retirement accounts. I can turn off reinvestment in a brokerage whenever I want and just take some cash instead, I cant do that with an IRA. So does this cost me some current dollars? Sure, but most of that is at a preferred rate anyways, and I dont live the lifestyle I could if I just spent all I have, so I can make it work. Im playing the long game and know what my end goal is, and when the day arrives that my kid decides to go to college, and Im ready to just pack up and sell the place I have and travel, or be closer to him, or whatever it may be, I have the option to make that decision without fear of tax consequence based on where my income is coming from, and when a lot of that is preferred rates, and I am pretty minimal income otherwise because of it, a lot of it can carry a 0 preferred rate in todays world. No guarantee that lasts, but to an extent I look at it as me prepaying my retirement plans on dividends and gains for living how I want and on my terms later."

I was so naive that I kept all my money in savings account paying almost nothing. I moved from another country so I didnt have any clue on IRA and my employer didnt offer 401k. I researched on my own and eventually opened IRA but still was naive enough to not contribute every year. Eventually, I became more intelligent. Just before Covid hit, I was looking at investing 100k that I had been saving. I thought its a big amount, I need a FA to help me invest properly. I met few but wasnt sold on any. So, I decided to do it on my own and I am glad the portfolio has been doing good. Over the last 4 years it has been at least matching SP. We now have a brokerage account, HSA, 2 Roth IRAs and 2 401ks. All retirement accounts have 3 funds FSELX, FXAIX, and VTI in 106030 allocation. I have also learned to feel, one needs a FA after 5m assets or if getting a 1m inheritance. Not only is that a life changing amount but one also needs to do proper tax planning. In your case, I think it is safe to assume, between your parents, your wifes parents and your grandparents, you two are likely to get significant inheritance combined mid 6 figures or may be even more. Hence, having a relationship with a FA would be beneficial. Id speak with both your grandparents and inlaws FA. Understand their plan, their investment philosophy, fees etc, do some research of my own and then pick one."

                    "text": "Im not an expert, but I researched this quite a bit a few years ago to begin utilizing the benefits of an HSA account. Heres some info... Assuming you have 26 pay periods per year, your low deductible plan will cost you 10,400 in premiums and wont begin providing benefits until at least an additional 650 is spent on medical costs for a total of 11,050. The high deductible plan will cost 6,500 in premiums and wont provide benefits until you pay at least 3,500 of medical expenses for a total of 11,000. Of course, this is assuming the deductible for only you. If you someone else in your family is the main source of medical bills, then youd have to rerun the numbers and it would vary some. Typically youre predicting one of two things. Either you predict that you wont spend much on medical expenses, in which case you actually save money going with the high deductible plan or you anticipate getting close to meeting your out of pocket max, in which case it seems your low deductible plan would be the most cost effective. The worst case scenario is paying a total of 12,400 for the year with the low deductible plan and 14,500 with the high deductible plan. The best case scenario is paying 10,400 for the low deductible plan and 6,500 for the high deductible plan. Some people like playing it safe and spreading the cost over time, so they go with the low deductible plan, but other people are willing to take the chance to potentially save a few thousand dollars if there arent many medical needs throughout the year and take the cheaper high deductible plan. Thats up to you and your familys situation or what makes you the most comfortable. The benefit of an HSA is that it has triple tax benefits, so it isnt taxed when you contribute, gains arent taxed, and it isnt taxed when you use it. You wont find that with an IRA or 401k. From what Ive seen, a lot of people use this as an additional retirement account as it has the best tax benefits of any account offered. They contribute the max amount allowed per year, invest it, and dont use it for reimbursement until retirement. I also believe that if you dont use the funds by a certain age I think either 67 or 72, it can start being used for ordinary expenses, but I cant remember the details on that. Obviously, laws can change around these things also. You do not have to use the HSA funds immediately and instead can pay medical expenses with a regular form of payment. If you do this and keep the medical receipt, you can choose, at any point in the future, to get reimbursement from your HSA. For example, you have a medical bill for 3,000 in 2025 and pay with your debit card. Save the receipt and keep any HSA funds invested and growing. In 2035 maybe you are looking to make a large purchase. You could, in 2035, use that receipt from 2025 and get reimbursed the 3,000 from your HSA. The benefit of this is that you have been able to grow that money for an additional 10 years tax free. The main point with HSAs is that they are the best tax opportunity account offered. I dont recall all of the aspects of it, but listed the main ones that resonated with me. Hopefully that is useful!"

If you dont use the HSA, when you turn 65 you can withdraw it without needing a doctors note, but you have to pay income tax on it. Ill pay myself back for my braces bill when Im 64. Take it out without having to pay the income tax. Most healthcare is used by people over 50. Looking at this long term, theres a good chance you or your wife will start to hit those deductibles or just have some expenses and you can pull that money out without having to pay the income taxes. Less insurance is better than more insurance. An extra 3900 that you have a choice of how to spend or save is better than guaranteeing you have to spend that 3900 whether you benefit from it or not. Risk is you have to spend 1100 more but, that is only if two of you get sick to the tune of several thousand dollars. Insurance prices their premiums to make the higher deductibles plans the ones to have. They are trying to shift the costs to consumers. This trend means that having the HSA in your back pocket leaves you covered, or sets you up to save more on insurance down the road. The 1000 contribution from the employer is an extra bonus. They are trying to incentivize you to take the cheaper plan. The more expensive plan is likely more than 1000 more expensive for them. You can max that HSA at about 8000, and youd be well to put at least the 3900 premium savings in it, but you should consider maxing it if you can."

From the 6000 difference in maxes, subtract the 3900 difference in premium and the 1000 from the employer for the HSA. That means only if you spend more than 6900 in health care, will the lower deductible plan come up cheaper, and even then it has to be in a particular way with 2 people spending 3500. If just one of you gets sick, the cheaper plan is still cheaper. If just one of you gets sick for more than 3500, then youre still 400 ahead in premiums even after paying that deductible, and you have the 1000 from the employer."

If you dont have young children, preexisting health conditions, or a decent amount of money in reserves, HSA is probably going to hurt you more than help. Quick example... my asthma medication cost 300 each month out of pocket if I used an HSA. But through my insurance, it costs me 6 dollars. So, as long as I refill my asthma medicine 4 times in a year, the value of the reduced premiums from the HSA versus insurance basically zeroes out. Additionally, the advantages of the HSA are more or less realized if you can contribute the premium differences and allocate to the HSA. In other words, youre not necessarily saving money. Youre just taking on more the risk yourself. For most people with families on a tight budget, I would argue that HSA is way too risky."

Set aside money for up to the OOP Maximum or deductible, since your individual bills will be more, but youll get probably save more from the lower premiums and HSA tax benefits. Some notes Another comment mentions a FICA tax exemption. This only applies if contribution are made directly from your paycheck or employer. If you make about 200K a year. So, you probably exceed the Social security limit, but are probably under the Medicare surtax limit. So the extra tax savings from FICA would likely be 1.45, and not 7.65. If you have two W2 employers in a year, both will deduct at 7.65 initially, but youll get the excess Social Security back on your tax return. The right health plan for you depends on the options available. If the PPO and HDHP have different networks, that could be an important difference. Also make sure that you arent discouraged from getting necessary care if you are on the HDHP. You may see higher bills than you are used to, but based on the specific plans you mentioned, you are likely saving money. Here, the PPO probably costs between 11700 and 13700, and HDHP costs between 5500 and 13500, if you count the HSA employer contribution. Theres other factors, since its harder to estimate costs on PPO, so youre more likely to be able to use pretax HSA funds to pay for care on the HDHP. This also assumes you only use innetwork care. Assuming the networks are the same, its probably going to be tough to find a scenario where the PPO costs less than the HDHP. If you get the HSA employer contribution for a partial year enrollment, its probably even better to sign up this year. However, one disadvantage of the HDHP is that you might owe a lot more earlier in the year due to the deductible, even though the cost savings are spread throughout the year. So PPO might sometimes be better for a partial year since the additional premium isnt as much. With a HDHP, you can use the last month rule to make HSA contributions as if you were enrolled the full year if you were enrolled on December 1. You just need to make sure you have a HDHP for the entire subsequent year. If you cant maximize it from your paycheck, you can make an HSA contribution until the April tax deadline for the prior year. HSA accounts are portable. If you want, you can open a HSA at another custodian and transfer your money and sometimes investments to them. This can be useful since there are HSA custodians with low or no fees. You also can use it for any future healthvisiondental costs, even if you switch to a plan that doesnt allow contributions like PPO or Medicare in the future. CA and NJ dont treat HSAs as taxdeferred. If you are a taxresident there, you dont get a state taxdeduction."

This means that if you take the HDHP, you can open a separate HSA at any custodian you like available at most brokerage firms, I have one through Fidelity. Just keep your yearly combined contributions meaning the 1000 from work, and whatever personal contributions you make under the annual limit which is currently 4150 for an individual and 8300 for a family plan in 2024. You will be able to get that sweet triple tax benefit with a lot more money. At least at Fidelity, there are no custodial fees or expenses other than the usual expense ratio of MFs and ETFs, and they will let you invest any amount into a broad range of securities. One other thing to consider is that when you get to Medicare age, you will have plenty of expenses! I was talking to a friend at work about the wonders of HSAs and he said I thought Medicare was free! Ha! There are plenty of deductibles, monthly premiums, copays, prescription costs... and all of them are eligible to be paid taxfree from your HSA. Even if you dont use all your HSA money, after 65 it becomes just like another traditional IRA if you dont use the money for healtcare. Just make withdrawals and pay regular income tax on it. Personally, every year I have a work contribution to my regular HSA account, which I use for usual medical expenses. I also contribute the rest up to the limit into my retirement HSA that I have fully invested in ETFs and will just stay there, growing until Im on Medicare."

So, a dividend is in effect a statement by management that they believe the company can perform and continue to deliver into the future. Boeing is a case study. Prior to 1998 investment in new aircraft programs and the companys reputation was seen as a way to protect investors, and the dividend, well into the future. Post 1998 the Jack Welch school that came to control the company was focused on short term results and stock buybacks.

Assumptions like management will always spend money in good faith to maximize earnings are useful if you want to make a world that is spreadsheetcompatible, but massively off the mark from the real world. In the real world management has incentives like getting the stock price to a certain number by a certain time to get a payout, future be damned. Creating unrealistic narratives about future earning to justify or increase PE ratios you know are excessive. Tech is a huge part of the SP500 and these problems are very common in tech. Around the dotcom crash this all got so bad that nobody could give out any dividends at all, for fear of demonstrating that they dont have endless golden geese lined up that the money would be better spent on. These days theyve gotten a little better about this and your Apple, Microsoft, and Google at least pay out a nominal dividend of like 0.51. Investors regularly get their money pissed up the wall like this in tech, when they would have been much better off just receiving it as a dividend than having tens of billions wasted on the metaverse with promises that all life would revolve around this concept in a few years, only to have them say actually never mind its all fake after a few years of stock options vesting at high valuations. Of course, were in the middle of a similar bubble with AI, so this all seems quaint now, but trust me, in a few years there will be a lot of people saying I wish they had just given me the money. So yeah, I like a small dividend, just to maintain a culture that this is my money they are playing with, and if they dont have a good use for it then Ill take it. A lot of this applies to share buybacks as well, although theyre prone to more bad incentives as they work through share price, so management is incentivized to do them even when the stock is already overvalued, and the personal incentives mentioned above etc."

Under this theory, a companys value is determined solely by its earnings power and investment decisions, not by how it distributes its profits. Whether profits are retained or distributed, the firms underlying valuation remains the same. I highlighted the key phrase in that paragraph you wrote. That lines says taxes, law changes, wares, natural disasters, and diseases, and criminal activity are Irrelevant. Clearly that is not the case if you look through history. The resent a pandemic and hurricanes and Russias invasion of Ukraine have all had massive impacts on society and many businesses did not survive. Looking further back Enron was seen as a great investment until it was people discovered that the executives lied about the companies performance and illegally manipulated energy prices in california. A tariff war was initiated by US government in 1929 resulted in in an about 60 drop in trade and the SP500 loosing 13 of it value in about 2 days. Add in WW2 and the economy needed 14 years to recover. That one assumption in the theory make it it invalid. Things beyond the control of the company can quickly turn it from profitable to a money looser and eventually kill the company. Look at the dividend return and capital gains earnings of the SP500 seperately 74 of of the funds performance comes from reinvesting the dividends Only 26 came from capital gains. Clearly the dividends from the index, as small as it is, are important. Clearly the divided irrelevance theory is not a valid theory. this video also explains the problems with the theory."

During your accumulation phase you would be wrong to have any allocation other than a diversified portfolio that is spread between growth and value with some adjustment for whether we are in a Value or a Growth phase in the market. In the Early Accumulation phase you should be heavily invested in equities as you dont much care about down cycles as you have little money at risk. In the late accumulation phase you start to build in a strategy for up and down markets as you now have some principal to protect. In the Preretirement stage you start to worry more about beta and less about alpha particularly if you have done a good job of accumulation. In Retirement your goals are preservation and income, so less beta is more important than excess alpha unless you are late to the party. Assuming you have hit your goals, then joining rdividend and forgetting a growth allocation makes total sense. In that stage assuming a good number, you can use the dividends and leave the kids the equities at whatever value they may have when you are gone. People throw around a 45 wdl number which is doable with a dividend stream and no stock sales if you pick your stocks correctly."

If the dividend are consisitan try above 5 you fund will still grow even if capital gains are close to zero. But it capital gains are very good you lock that gain in by investing in dividends.

With a bond they cannot exactly just cut the interest that would require a default, that means the company goes bankruipt . A company can cut or reduce the dividend at any time. So they are just much safer in general . Second bonds tend to rise in value when we hit a recession because usually in a recession the Federal reserve bank lowers interest rates, when rates go lower bond prices rise So in a recession stocks tend to go down, but bond holdings tend to appreciate helping offset your stock losses Dividend stocks tend to fall with the market, they may not fall as much but they still are highly correlated with the market , in the covid crash SCHD fell 31 in a month , VOO fell about 32 so you can see its not even that much safer In the initial panic BND bond fund only fell like 4"

The primary reason being is a company will trade at some much higher multiple say 7 to 20 times depending on business so if youre only lent 3 to 4, you are safely inside a potential EV of the company. Secondarily, the lender wants to ensure you generate enough cash flow to cover the interest expense of the debt. There are other underwriting metholdogies though, multiple on recurring revenue or pure asset based lending against liquidation value of assets are two other common ones"

How I view my situation is I would like to own asset stock, bond or real estate in the long run. Since I am not in the financial position to buying a house. But I can invest in a portfolio of stock and saving or bond to enjoy compund interests. My split is 8020, where 80 is in the form of stock index ETFs. I belive this related to our question regarding savinginvesting percentage. As many others has mentioned, it does depends on your risk tolerance level. I am sharing my as a refers for you. The common belief for asset allocation is percentage for allocating save asset should be roughly your age. For example, if you are at your 20s, you should invest 80 into say stock index, and 20 remaind in saving or bond where is it much less risky. So you might want to adjust this percentage to match your risk tolerance level. Back to my case, my hope is that my stockbond portfolio will increase in the relatively long run i.e. 35 years. I saw some stats that in Australia the average annual return of real estate and stock over past 30 years are similar. Based on this assumption which again is just a blief of mine. It makes sense to me to invest in my stockbond portfolio for the next 35 years. Depends on the situation in 35 years time, I will then decide what percentage of my portfolio that I am willing to sell for buying my home. Above is just my humble opinion and what I am practicing. By no means these are sophisticated. Hope this help to address your question. Like you, I would hear and learn from other investers who are likely to be much more experienced then me Happy saving and investing!"

Whatever you dont want to put into a large fund, put it in a money market fund or purchase 36 month CDs. If you are not risk tolerant and you feel more comfortable having the cash available for safety and are worried the US could enter a recession, then youd want to have most of money in the HYSA or a money market fund. If you feel like you may need to access that money, youd stay away from CDs. If you dont need access to it, but also arent comfortable letting it ride in the stock market, then CDs are a popular route. The key thing is you want to diversify. Dont put all your eggs in one basket. Even if you are risk averse, you likely can still afford to put a percentage into large market and CDs if you have a solid 36 months of emergency cash saved up."

The high inflation rates we saw during and after the pandemic are now baked in to the prices of goods and services, and no amount of disinflationa reduction of the inflation rate, not a reversal of inflation will bring back preCOVID prices. What has happened is that the rate at which goods and services naturally increase in price over time has been brought back to a more reasonable level. This is a good thing, and means that prices should be at a more steady level compared to before. If prices were to return to preCOVID levels, we would be dealing with deflation. Longstoryshort, the implications that deflation has on the broader economy means that deflation is not a good thing. In fact, a return to preCOVID pricesdeflation would actually be a sign of exactly what youre speculating, a weakening economy. That said, there has also been a rise of corporate greed and price gouging, which has artificially raised the price of certain goods and services. This is separate from inflation, and absolutely needs to be addressed by our government. ELI5 Inflation is natural. Most of the time, prices go up slowly. During extreme eventsCOVID, the amount of inflation can go up. Afterwards, the government can then do things to make the amount of inflation go back down to normal levels. When this happens, the prices dont go back down, but instead are back at to the point where they go up slowly. Im not an expert."

You risk keeping your money in the bank instead of putting it in the stock market. You risk your life delivering food to people you dont even know. You risk your life crossing the street. When you gamble, you risk losing everything to gain nothing in the small probability of gaining it all back and then some. When you invest, even if you lose, you get some value back on balance.

I think a lot of novice precious metals investors get FOMOed into buying near or at historical highs and end up making really bad investments. Dont fall into this trap. Buy when prices are low and nobody is interested."

Its useful to think of gold as an open ended insurance policy on currency devaluation with no counterparty risk. People around the world are buying gold because they believe rightly or wrongly that currency devaluations in their countries are becoming more probable. If the market is efficient it is not the price of this insurance increases or decreases according to the probability of these devaluation events. Basically by bringing up the Stone Age people are saying that all kinds of insurance only have value if the insured event happens. This is not true, especially when the insurance is tradeable."

Yes a person could try and stash some foreign currency just in case their home currency experiences something like Venezuela. But it might be easier to just stash some gold and then exchange it for which ever currency didnt get impacted. For example if the US goes to war with China both of those currencies will likely take a hit look at what initially happened to both Ukraine and Russia. In that scenario there is also a good chance that countries allied to those nations like Britain, Canada, and other NATO European countries will also have their currencies impacted. So if I stocked up on some of those foreign currencies I would still likely be impacted by inflation but if I held gold it would still retain its purchasing power around the world and thus would be worth the new inflated US dollar price. As compared to the set amount of dollars that I might have saved in my savings account. Now Venezuela was a unique circumstance with so much hyperinflation that they couldnt sell their gold for their own currency because there simply wasnt enough money in circulation to cover the increase. That meant they were forced into literally using foreign currency or the precious metals themselves to buy things. That wont ever likely happen in the US because there will almost always be enough physical paper money somewhere in the world to exchange precious metals back into USD it is the world reserve after all. In essence that gold could work its way through the banks to somewhere like India or Mexico etc where they would send back some of the USD they have been holding onto in exchange for it. Thats why having some small percent of a persons net worth in silvergold is a good idea"

Do you charge different rates or earn commission for passive versus active investments? Because the battle isnt about returning 2 over TBills the battle is justifying your prices to your client. There are some people who are perpetually stingy, and you would have to justify a 0.01 annual fee for your services, but if you can address the psychological factor of mistrust or overvaluation of your services, you will have much greater leeway and more options to obtain the better return that your client claims to want. I think its time to have a lunch with the dude, explain riskadjusted returns, detail the options that youve been able to research, and how they fall short of his requirements. While I can never say 100 for sure, I would be willing to bet a lot that a solution for this guys preferences does not exist, and could not exist. TBills are THE GOTO for risk free return. If there was a passive product that was TBill returns 2.0 for no additional risk or effort, then NO ONE WOULD EVER INVEST IN TBILLS. This other solution would be the only solution, and probably would impact the entire market, since now, return is not measured against the riskfree rate, but the riskfree rate plus 2.0. Or, maybe it exists, but has so much additional cost that you end up netting less than the TBill rate. But the idea of risk free but more than the risk free rate is contrary to the base assumptions of the economic principles of supply and demand.

And if he knows it, but is still asking, then 1 hes an asshole and is just taking the piss out of you, or 2 hes making you justify your returns and cost of services versus this unreasonable benchmark, with the hopes of bidding you down. All you can really do is offer the products and services that would be the best fit, at a reasonable cost of service, let him choose, and then get him to confirm that choice in writing."

In fact, they were the first two closedend funds to introduce CLO equity investing to the retail investment market, it previously having been limited to the institutional investing realm.

I wonder why she left and handed it off to the old guy, and if it suggests she would not return to the position"

The point of rail, which Buffett has written about many times, is that its at this point pretty irreplaceable, so he owns something irreplacable which will continue being relevant for transport for many decades to come, as its the cheapest way to transport massive amounts of goods in the US.

I would say that Mars has a decent moat in the candy bar business and in the pet food business. Its probably comparable to CocaColas moat in the beverage industry or Apples in the smartphone industry. So I would argue that Mars is definitely interesting to Buffett.

If my company had a mandatory holding period I would probably contribute less though. I personally dont like holding stock in a company I work for. Downturns get magnified and if I am laid off due to market conditions then I am also likely taking losses on those ESPP shares. But, everyones situation is different so just something to consider.

JPMorgan analysts told clients after field work and discussions with management, they cut their estimate for VFs fiscal 2025 earnings per share. The analysts pointed to wholesale challenges with The North Face, and ongoing traffic headwinds across brands. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients that after recent fieldwork and management access, they cut their fiscal 2025 earnings per share EPS estimate to 65 cents, which they noted was 35 below the Wall Street consensus. The analysts based that on an 8 yearoveryear decline in revenue, also worse than consensus forecasts. Ill add that Im not saying just because JPM says its bad, its bad. But wanted to get your take on why its not bad. Why not just wait till after Q2 print to buy to see where things shake out. How did you get comfortable. Ive also been watching this same stock for a year now."

The companys EBITDA and operating income have varied significantly, while balance sheet metrics have seen declines. Margins and ratios have been mixed, with a notable drop in net profit margin. VFC has faced both positive and negative news in the market and is exposed to diverse risks across operational, regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive, technological, and ESG factors. Key Financial Insights Revenue increased from 9.24 billion in 2020 to 11.61 billion in 2023 but declined to 10.45 billion in 2024. Net income dropped significantly from positive figures to a loss of 968.88 million in 2024. Gross profit margins remained stable, ranging from 41 to 52. Positive free cash flow in most years, except for 2023. Historical volatility of 58 indicates moderate stock price volatility compared to the market. Risk Factors Operational risks from supply chain disruptions and quality control issues. Regulatory risks related to trade policies, labor regulations, and environmental standards. Macroeconomic risks including economic downturns, currency fluctuations, and inflation. Competitive risks due to industry competition and evolving consumer preferences.

I agree that TNF is currently the revenue driver hence this delayed winter in the States could affect sales. But keep in mind 60 of the sales comes from Europe Asia. Only 40 of it comes from the US. One thing this analyst Matthew Boss didnt add in his thesis is the thriving backpacks business of TNF, this and international sales would likely offset the decline in the US. One more thing is that the CEO has already guided TNF revenue downwards for the coming quarter last earnings call. The stock also has retraced since this negative catalyst watch, so you could argue it is priced in. The problem with holding off the purchase because of this one negative catalyst is that when all the other brands show signs of turning Vans, Timbs, Dickies of which the latter two and he announces two more brand sales Jansport Kipling and completely brings us back to optimal capital structure, we would be off to the races, being potentially valued at 1x PS which would be 10B in market cap."

Redwire does more than provide RF and Antennas for RKLBs SDA satellites, they are also base lined into York and other providers platforms. 2. Rocket Structures. Something that alot of people dont know is that Redwire is also helping Xbow systems with the SRM production by supplying the company with structures for their bolt family of rockets. 3. Moon Mars. Redwire has lunar and martian optionality, they have multiple different lunar contract like MASON with NASAtipping point which is for building landing pads and roads using regolith VSAT which is a partnership with the company astrobotic where Redwire is providing ROSA arrays of various sizes to provide power for the lunar surface. For Mars Redwire has been awarded a study contract for Design Reference Mission DRM 3 of NASAs Mars Commercial Services program which outlines a commercial imagery mission to support lowercost, higherfrequency missions to the Red Planet There is in fact even more I could talk about too but ill cut it here, thanks for the post and the visability into a great company."

Zoomies and alphas dont have nealy the same cereal consumption habits of Millennials and cereal has fallen vastly out of favor and pop cultural icon status from its peak in the 90s. Kelloggs has also been desperate to maintain profits and has resulted in cereal experiencing some of the highest inflation and shrinkflation that would make my waistline blush. General Mills Kellogs has also lost the cereal duopoly from the 90s and theres now a ton of competition. Rather rarely are people buying Kellogg brands these days, let alone cereal to begin with. If you read Kelloggs financial reports, they pretty much routinely state that cereal sales are down and falling. I suspect this was a big driver for the spinoff is that theyve continued to decline, quite substantially. The upside? Well, the profit margins on cereal are obscene so they only have to sell a few boxes a week to make , and they can keep raising prices till a box of Honeycombs Harry Potter is 30box I think the best case to put them into is managed decline. Maybe they can hire some TiKTok Influencers to peddle cereal and get it to become a hot desirable meme amongst the zoomers or something. But if they arent successful, its not going to be looking good."

An argument could be made that lowering rates might make an environment for businesses where more enter the industry and push prices down through over supply.

TMF will rise if recession fears rise, and is not moved by the fed funds rate. Though these two usually go hand in hand, which is why people think this relationship exists. Just go plot the fed funds rate on top of TLT. You will see there is not always correlation. Then plot periods of recession on there as well, and you will see the pattern. Though recession fears are quite justified so you play is valid. Just the reasoning is off."

While early adoption may focus on premium, shortdistance travel like between airports and city centers, the longterm vision is urban air mobility thats more affordable, ecofriendly, and efficient.

Going full futurist, it could be used to deploy package delivery drones fly over an area and drop the drones that guide the packages down, release, and return to the mothership.

You can pack cars in there, but there will be very limited landing space. Piloting Alot of bad drivers out there, and this will require laymen to think in 3D about moving through the world. Crashing at 300ft has different consequences from crashing on the ground. Logistics Im not an expert so this may be different in other places, but in MA helicopters currently dont file flight plans and operate according to basic rules e.g., flight deck, nogo zones like airports, etc.. Throw thousands of yokels into the mix and that becomes untenable. Air traffic control would not be insurmountable, but it would be a new and potentially complex regime. Insurance It took most carriers years to insure Teslas when they first came out, and those are just cars with different motors. It will take some time for them to figure out affordable consumer flyingmachine insurance none of these things are unsolvable, but together they make me skeptical that this is close to being commercially viable at scale."

Vertiports Landing Companies are starting with dedicated landing pads on rooftops and helipads, and the idea is to eventually build out multilevel vertiports. Itll take time, but the strategy is there. 2. Pilots for Now, Automation Later Most eVTOLs will be piloted like helicopters at first, but as tech and regulations evolve, we could see automated systems take over. Redundant safety features are already in place to keep things secure. 3. Air Traffic Management Companies are working closely with the FAA to roll out a controlled, stepbystep integration into urban airspace. Its not going to be an overnight switch to thousands of eVTOLs, but a gradual rampup. 4. Insurance Evolution Youre spot oninsurance will be tricky, but this is something weve seen before with early electric vehicles. Insurers are already getting involved, and as eVTOLs prove themselves, the insurance market will adjust. These are big hurdles, no doubt, but if it all comes together, its going to be revolutionary.

All the zoomies on TikTok love it! That said, I dont play with fast casual because its all very irrational and often can swing wildly, so Im not touching it either way but Id probably wager money itd continue going upandupandup!! until theres an external force that causes mass reevaluation of the fastcasual hype space. Theyre all going to rideordie together. Its a very fascinating space imo, but one I wouldnt touch, and if I did Id be shortterm bullish. Good luck on the small balls!

They cannot be the leader, they are in the US and labor law matters here, shooting margin lower and TSMC is just too far ahead and will not make the same mistake as they did. D lunar lake looks promising, its really giving ARM a run for their money. Bear case A Shitty management the board and the ceos in the past decade, have been assholes. They just missed each leap that the world has taken in semis. You can miss one turn and thats acceptable. But if you miss all of them, its cultural. They did not have and still dont have any answer to the competition AMD, Nvidia, TSMC. They simply cannot be trusted. They havent done anything to earn the trust of the investors. They ran a company that lost market share to AMD that was close to bankruptcy and still are. There are too many leadership issues this is well known and public domain news. This can be fixed but its gonna take a really long time. B the bet is too big they are trying dual front PC design and at the same time manufacturing. Manufacturing is tough and its a big deal, you have to actually make th chip and not just design a chip and bail out. So far, yet to hear good news on 18 A status. Betting a company does not mean anything if you cant get the products to customers. The world simply dont give a fuck. C Lunar lake manufacturing Lunar lake was not manufactured at Intel. It was made using TSMC 3 NM process. If you are thinking about a 10 year horizon, there are better ways to make money,. If you keep your eyes open, keep shuffling your portfolio and dont take crazy bets you can still make returns that will be far better than INTC. I simply dont trust these guys. They fucked up and will fuck up again. Its just in their blood now and they are just too stubborn to admit that."

It doesnt mean going against the crowd is always a winning strategy, but if you just follow what every retail trader is doing, you wont get great returns. For those looking to play it safe, ETFs like the SP 500, QQQ, or MSCI World make a lot of sense and can provide decent returns. When I think about the next 10 years, Im not too sure what will happen. Im more focused on the next 13 years. Sure, you can jump on the NVIDIA train and the whole AI hype, but while AI is a hot topic right now, weve seen four waves of AI before, each bringing new revolutionary advancements. Im skeptical about how smart these LLMs really are, and there are many other forms of AI that have potential too. Additionally, NVIDIAs valuation is influenced by factors like demand for gaming GPUs, data center growth, and the overall semiconductor market trends. However, with a 3 trillion market cap, Im curious to see if they can maintain that level. It seems heavily tied to momentum and hype, and we all know hype can fizzle out. If youre looking to play it safe over the next year, maybe consider investing in a few broad and diversified ETFs, and perhaps look into some China and India indexes, too. Overall, I think investing in Intel could be a good addition to your portfolio, but I wouldnt recommend putting your entire portfolio into it."

The deck is stacked against them. Their valuation may be book look up goodwill if you want to see whats written in the book but they are priced at book value for a company that was expected to be an industry leader in about 10 different areas. Their future plans dont include industry leadership in any area and they are exiting more than half of the markets theyve been working in and borrowing money to do XX billion capex in. Its no joke to spend 20B on capex in the hope of entering a market, and then exit that market. Its no joke to do that in 5 different markets in 10 years. Its no joke to put out a quarterly report showing you lost 9 billion in 3 months, after your turnaround was supposed to have been under way for a year and a half. As an investor you have the option to invest in other companies, ones that dont flush 100 billion down the toilet. The idea that theyve gotten away with it for this long is not a bull pitch it means there are a set of entrenched managers there who think its OK to run their business this way.

Look at NVDAits insanely overpriced because everyone and their mom is buying it, thinking the line will just keep going up forever. These companies have PE ratios over 60, which is ridiculous. Its starting to feel like the Dotcom bubble, but this time with AI. Honestly, outside of a few specific uses, AI is kind of useless in its current state and nowhere near as smart as people think. With the massive investments going into AI, the returns needed to justify them are just unrealistic. Sure, in the short term, the AI boom might keep pushing tech stocks and the market up, but once the returns dont materialize fast enough, the bubble is going to pop. Im not saying AI is a total flop, but were not there yet, and the market is way too impatient. Meanwhile, Intel is in a much better spot strategically. Theyre still super important for the U.S., consumer PCs, and cloud computing, and theres still huge demand for energyefficient chips. Over the next two years, I think Intel will outperform NVIDIA by a lot."

Just to clarify, you are saying that Intel could succeed on 18A and then somehow that would make their chips better than AMDs and where could we see the reviews on that? Also if Intel succeeds on 18A, would they manufacture for Nvidia and AMD or would they try to take the market share?"

Youre left with Intel Products, solely using TSMC, which is earning an annual operating profit of 10Bnyr. PE ratio goes to 5. Share price goes up immediately. So even in worst case scenario, Intel actually goes up from where it is now. Have you thought about this? Or am I mad?"

When you get experienced enough, there will always be times you have high degree of certainty, and the trade will work almost perfectly. You never want to run out of bullets when that kind of situation happens, and I can assure you, they will happen, way more than what we expect actually. TIGR is an outlier on the speed and size of the gain, but in terms of degree of certainty, it only ranks slightly above average for me.

We dont have Papajohns here and I dont really know anyone who really likes them. So I cant attest for price. But Dominos is quite literally the most regarded easiest platform ever to buy and pickup or delivery ever, complete with very slick tracking and realtime updates thats extremely accurate. Regardless of whatever you or me may think about quality, theyve invested a lot into online ordering starting around 2010 and it shows. In terms of pricing, Dominos is actually perhaps the only reasonable fastfood major chain that hasnt jacked prices to the stratosphere and are affordable to the masses these days. Theyre almost always running discountscoupons something like 2top2medium for 13. Shit man, you cant even buy a shitty 9.8oz frozen pizza from Safeway for under 10 these days."

Just go try it out on each service and you can see for yourself. There are many negative aspects to this ipo , Id say the main one is virtually all the income coming from 1 customer but I think they have a unique take on speed and even tsmc is trying to develop full wafer solutions themselves so it probably has a future. I would have preferred they waited a couple more years for revenue to develop before an ipo. Disclaimer. I am invested 20k pre ipo and will be buying more if there is a dip."

What I am saying is that the information and their comparisons are very outdated as Microsoft has aggressively opened the throughput for the OpenAI models. One thing I will quibble with is that api limit is related to inference speed because it is throughput. In a way it is expected throughput as well. Heres what I mean. Previously when you used LLMs in Azure you would get a warning for tokens you could generate per minute if you went over the limit and then outright rate limiting would 404 your requests going forward. Now, to your point latency is what we are really talking about here. What I can tell you is that each model has its own latency expectations that Microsoft never publishes because if youre on a pay as you go service you are effectively on a shared service. What I can tell you is that 4 was terrible, 4turbo was a little better, 4o is a lot better and 4omini is perfect. In terms of latency. 4omini is a smaller param model. Tokens are complex especially in an enterprise environment. I am passing thousands of tokens through expecting thousands of tokens back on complex queries. With that said, if you really are comparing apples to apples small model versus small moel I think their claims fall apart and thats my point."

Since the new GPTo1, many factors influence speed and throughput behind the scenes, and they do indeed relate."

What cerebras have created is not trivial and not really that simple to recreate quickly . For sure its going to be expensive but its more in the league of supercomputing. Whether there is a market for it remains to be seen. Dont get me wrong , Im not a cerebras fanboy The chances of them taking significant market share from nvidia is slim but I dont believe its non existent. The main concern most people have is the g42 involvement and bulk of revenue. I think its a legitimate concern and will probably be the main reason for a fall in share price after ipo but I myself am not particularly worried by it. I think g42 have probably got a great deal , better than anyone else will get and they will stay on board while cerebras gets more customers.

My guess on that video is that it was deleted because someone thought it revealed too much too late, I guess. But I could see myself deleting it too, why give everyone a complete roadmap of your proprietary tech. Sure, they could figure it out anyways but let them spend the time and resources. You nailed the main risk on the company, the customer concentration is enormous, that is something they will need to work to rapidly alleviate, but part of the problem here is there arent that many entities that can write these checks and need the product bad and Nvidia has a lock on the 4 or 5 regular joes stateside, and those guys arent gonna turn to a startup for many good reasons. So its either you take on the rare big elephant when you see it, or you remain in little league. Nvidia, which is orders of magnitude the size of Cerebras also has high customer concentration. Perhaps as inferencing becomes a bigger part of the AI process there will be some changes on that in the sector as smaller players buy a bigger share of the sector output. But for Cerebras the combo of just 1 customer at the scale that is relevant for the IPO the geopolitical risk of that customer is too high to waive off. I think as investors one just takes known facts into account, pick spots not get too greedy, you know. The OP didnt understand many things. The idea that if US reduces export controls this is good for Nvidia and bad for Cerebras is incorrect. Actually, for G42 in particular, which is not just a customer but an investor in Cerebras, it likely accelerates Cerebras sales.

If Godot was so good, Unity will be screwed hard by now but from what we have seen, it just serves as a cheap, nonintuitive, slow and buggy alternative with a mental head lead dev. I hope it gets acquired by META or MFST actually, but the company and their product are not going away anytime soon."

The other problem is that as Clear expands its base it makes itself less exclusive. I just recently went through TSA in Atlanta. PreCheck was so backed up they had to convert 2 regular security lines to PreCheck and they told the rest of us to keep our shoes and belts on. They turned on the regular metal detectors and bypassed the millimeter wave scanners. They already know that all it takes is one really bad holiday season of missed flights and stranded passengers for people to get fed up with TSA crap. Remember, TSA has more value to the government as a veterans jobs program. It was never real security. If they have to water it down to keep it they absolutely will."

Im back in, Im going for 6.50 shortish date calls and 7.50 Jan 2025 calls with plans to roll and add. FSLY is back to book value and Im more bullish than ever after the last earnings. Edit Last time I hedged my calls with QQQ puts but interestingly FSLY didnt go down when the market did, so I ended up making a decent profit and putting that into FSLY calls.

They have the lowest days of inventory in the industry and this isnt going to change overnight magically. They literally selling more Cybertrucks now than all the other EV trucks combined. Their EVs are very well priced. On top of all that, you are going to buy puts before the 1010 event? Perfect timing to knock 50 bucks off the stock 1010 event is a total coin flip.

He understands the mechanics of publicly traded stocks really well and knows once the major indexes own your stock, theyre going to pump it forever, look at Microsoft and Apple. Also, many people who are shareholders will never sell because they have owned it since before the first split. Many, just like me know as long as SpaceX, X, and grok, never go public, the value of Tesla will continue to go through the roof. It has nothing to do with cars or solar. We know the company isnt doing well but as long as the other companies are not publicly traded, theyre essentially part of Tesla. Its going to take some type of crisis to crash his stock.

I am looking to purchase some calls as well as the price is inflated and you will be getting them at a discount, but I dont know what strike or duration seems best.

Right now, theyre still riding on their name and the bonus of being the first big player. But China is catching up, and theyre doing so rapidly, which is gonna put a lot more pressure on Tesla in the chinese market. South Korean companies are head and shoulders above Tesla when it comes to procuding EVs, the difference in quality and technology is astounding. Eventually, that quality is gonna prevail and its gonna flush Tesla out of certain market segments. Now, lets talk about Europe First of all, the quality of Teslas is horrible. Like, really, really horrible, really poorly processed. And that becomes especially evident if you are used to european or particularly german car makers. Thats one thing. Something like a Polestar running on Volvos platform is gonna give you a much higher quality vehicle at a similar price. But lets go back to Germany in particular the german car manufacturers have collectively fucked the transition to EVs theyre slow and sluggish in the transition, theyre hurting because the car industry is experiencing hardship as a whole, and theyre consistently slipping in terms of development. Now, why is that not a good sign of Tesla? Well, thats because theyve been doing poor to an extent that has the entirety of Europe rethink the previously agreed on goal of banning new ICE vehicles by 2035. If they void that agreed goal, it means prolonged and stronger competition from ICE vehicles on the market, the transition to EVs is gonna commence slower which in turn gives other car manufacturers more time to catch up in terms of their product and in terms of their infrastructure. As for everything about Tesla thats not directly related to their EV business well, how have those things been going so far? Nothing but smoke and mirrors at this point."

Lets look at some actual facts Tesla delivered 5,175 Cybertrucks in July, compared to a combined 5,546 registrations of every nonTesla electric truck, which includes the Ford F150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, Chevy Silverado EV, and Hummer EV. As for the rest of it, yeah the market is getting tougher. All EV registrations, Teslas share dropped from 56 to 48. And thats with 17k MORE registrations than the same time a year ago.

Tech companies trade at a high multiple because, they can scale simply by adding compute. You can write software once, and sell it millions of times. Its more complicated than that, but you get the idea. Teslas valuation is based on the hope that everyone will be licensing Teslas FSD, battery designs, and other technologies at some point. Otherwise, the only way Tesla can scale is to build huge factories and hire armies of skilled workers. Young tech companies are expected to grow market share by 20 per year, and established tech giants are expected to have margins far higher than Teslas. I dont know if the Cybertruck will turn out to be a failure, but it is certainly a PR headache, and a distraction. Tesla might be better served by updating its aging cash cows, the Model Y and Model 3. The humanoid robot is an embarrassing joke by any metric and a further distraction. Elon himself has said that Teslas valuation only makes sense if full autonomy is achieved. So far, it looks like Elons gamble on using visiononly for FSD against the advice of his engineers, has backfired. Waymo and Cruise have arguably pulled ahead of Tesla in realworld autonomy. Elon had better pull a pretty big rabbit out of his hat with the robotaxi announcement. A Google engineer was once quoted as saying Were 90 of the way there with autonomous driving. Now we just need to finish the last 90. His point was that the remaining edge cases left to solve were so difficult that they might take decades. It may be that these remaining problems cannot be solved without radarlidar. If that is the case, then Tesla is in trouble."

The Cybertruck seems more hype than value but Ive felt this way about other things, like Apple products. Musk has alienated much of his previous customer base and its not clear whether new ones will take their places, nor whether many of the new ones have the cash to do so. Ive read that Powerwalls are a good product. From what I could learn about their roof solutions, customer support was terrible at that time. I wouldnt short them, because human irrationality is essentially boundless, but I wouldnt invest in them, at least not at this time. I do hold shares of RIVN, which I see as built upon a sturdier foundation, but a recent car reliability graphic put Rivian near the bottom and Tesla was around the middle."

The Cybertruck while being incredibly cool and was hard to turn away my order but you cant compare the first edition R1T to a Cybertruck.

Just look at the average age of magnificent seven stocks. Toyota has decades of experience with ICE cars. Their factories, engineers and marketing are all geared toward ICE and hybrid cars, and they have struggled to create a successful pure EV. Early Audi EVs sometimes displayed low oil warnings, as they had tried to reuse software and sensors from their ICE cars. Theres something to be said for starting from scratch. This lack of legacy baggage is why creative destruction is a thing. Older companies gradually get bogged down by outdated products and practices and are picked off by younger, more nimble competitors. Of course, if EV adoption continues to slow down due to range anxiety and lack of compelling products, the oldschool companies might yet win out. Hybrid sales are already picking up relative to pure EVs, which is part of why Toyota is still relevant."

The issue here is whether saying a car company that has the best selling model but its 1 of 4 can compare to car companies that have more model offerings? If Toyota only sold 4 models, they would have the best selling car on the market by far. Thats why its an absurd claim. Total car sales are how you compare car companies. Tesla isnt there."

Volkswagen sold 9.24M, vs 1.81M sold by Tesla. Around 18 of new car sales in the US in 2024 so far have been EVs. This leaves 82 of the market for non EV makers, while Tesla faces increased competition from new EV models every year. Tesla has cut prices in part because of competition from traditional automakers and EVonly companies in China. I doubt anyone will take over the top spot from Tesla when it comes to EVs anytime soon in the US and Europe, anyway. but other companies will continue to chip away at their lead unless they start to focus on updating their most popular models. In China and the developing world, companies like BYD will dominate the EV market. Tesla is already down to a 6 market share in China."

I do root for Tesla as a fastgrowing US carmaker, but I try to evaluate the company objectively as an automotive stock, rather than a techgrowth stock.

He claimed a Tesla would be able to travel from LA to NYC in summon mode sometime in 2018. I do like Tesla cars. I came really close to buying a Model S, but I would up going with an Audi S5 at the last minute. I wish they would refocus on cars rather than robots and AI. I dont own any automotive stocks outside of index funds, btw. VW is hemorrhaging sales left and right. Some regions are better than others, but they are doing OK. VW expects global revenue to increase by 5 in 2024. They were up 31 in the US in the past quarter YOY. Their EV sales are down over 15, however. the best selling car in China The singular car being the operative word. BYD has multiple goodselling models, and they have 31 of the market versus 6.5 for Tesla down from 9 in a single year. This is not a good trend. At this rate, Tesla could be a nonfactor in the Chinese market within 3 years. This is not all Teslas fault except for their inability to deliver a truly lowcost EV. China is subsidizing the shit out of the EVbattery space, which makes it hard for anyone to compete. Chinese firms will own the lowend worldwide. The impact will not be as great in the US and Europe, due to steep tariffs, but the developing world will belong to Chinese companies."

The offset to this is if a firm is truly creating operational value add to the business and focused on EBITDA expansion rather than arbitrage in valuation multiples, then it works out. On the flip side, it can create a bubble, essentially it becomes flipping when they focus on multiple arbitrage, which has happened more recently due to the availability of cash."

This money has to go somewhere to grow. However, public stock markets just arent big enough to handle all this cash. If too much money floods the public market, prices would go crazy due to simple supply and demand more money chasing the same number of stocks. Its like if everyone in a huge city wanted to buy just one houseprices would skyrocket. So, these big money players needed an alternative. Thats where private markets come in, specifically Private Equity PE and Venture Capital VC VC is for startups or earlystage companies. They fund highrisk, highreward businesses hoping to strike it big. PE buys out more mature companies, often aiming to restructure and make them more profitable. Why the PE VC industry exploded PE and VC offer access to these private markets, and institutions were eager to jump in because public markets alone couldnt absorb all their money. The PE industry, in particular, has ballooned from managing 500 billion to a whopping 8 trillion in 20 years. This explosion is simply because PE firms managed to convince big institutions to pour in cash to them by selling them the promise of high returns. The problem In VC, things are looking rough. A lot of opportunists jumped into VC, promising big returns but actually delivering poor or even negative results. However, VC firms still made money off management fees, while investors were left holding the bag with bad returns. Even if PE is facing the same destiny, the bubble burst is simply people getting bad returns. Whats the unwinding? I think you have misunderstood the Unwinding. It isnt a bubble burst, it just means that eventually, investors and the public will catch on to the fact that PEVC firms may not have been as good at delivering returns as promised. The issue is that many of these firms have found ways to make themselves rich through management fees taking a cut from the funds they manage and carried interest taking a chunk of profits, but not suffering equally from losses. The risk is heavily onesidedinvestors take most of it, while the fund managers make money regardless of the results. And remember who have funds the investors from the beginning? Its common people like you and me either through pensions funds, taxes, HNWI who in their turn often have made money from being exited by PE. So its ordinary people who are left holding the bag when this is all said and done. TLDRELI5, The world has created a lot of money supple wealth, and we need places to invest it, but there isnt enough public stocks for it. People in Private Equity PE and Venture Capital VC have made money on the shared wealth we have created in society regardless of the fund returns and people are finally taking about it."

The loan they take out is paid by everyone who pays taxes. The question is, what happens when the people who pay taxes can no longer pay taxes to pay for your loan? Money gets printed to cover it, and inflation keeps going up. the economy tanks because you needed more numbers in a bank account. Private equity is quite literally a parasite on a capitalist system. No work or actual risk is put in. These firms are written loans and run off with real cash. They buy up commodities and treat them as stores of value, like housing and farm land, and sit on them to drive prices up. Its a losing game that causes everything to collapse.

And the longer the schemes that private equity runs could work, the worse it would be because it proves that its profitable for them and would keep destroying quality."

You pointed out two important points that detracts from your initial assumption and thats the systemic risk with these folks 1 Opaque valuations no one knows their true position including the banks. 2 If things go bad, they cant liquidate without a massive haircut.

My observations The TCJA introduced 163j which limits tax deduction of interest and only recently mid 2021 finalized regs. More pressure on tax reporting, although probably wont hit until 35 years once IRS audits kick in. The reporting rules are complicated and were designed to ensure excessive interest deductions arent taken at the partner level. In 2023 alone there was over 1 T of new capital. There simply arent enough good investments. Now PE is searching for anything with reliable fees, even hitting up accounting firms or any kind of service provider. Worse yet is the zombie funds, and general lack of liquidity with these fee inducing holdings for unhappy investors. This will start to get worse unless investors continue to keep buying and eventually PE owns virtually everything, with fund of funds and new funds churning out liquidity to needy investors. Thus continuing the cycle of bad valuations for the sake of making new funds."

So I replied to them. Then, they asked for all my key metrics. Then they made the offer. A few phone calls to negotiated the details. Then, the due diligence process was a breeze. Then we signed. On the closing day I was sitting there refreshing my banks page to see when the wire comes in. It was taking forever, so I called them. They were like oh, yeah, I forgot to ask Mike to sign off on the wire, hold on, I think I saw him leaving for lunch let me grab him now. Like its nothing to them. Then an hour or so later the wire came in. And my low five digit account balance changed to seven digit balance after a refresh of a page. Then the panic set it. So I started another business literally a week later which a few years later I sold for seven fig to a competitor of the guys that bought this one. Different niche, so noncompete didnt apply but similar business model. Six months later I started another business, which I still have 15 years later. It was a fun ride. But I was a regard and didnt invest the money, so I pretty much live off of my current business ventures now instead of having several mil in sp500 and being semiretired, if I just werent a moron. But back then the market was in this giant sideways mode, so I just didnt believe it would grow in the time horizon for which I planned. I was wrong on both counts. The market eventually started to grow, and time horizons of young people are way too short to be realistic. The moral of the story is dont be a regard and invest. Think decades not years. Youll thank yourself later. Now Im must excuse myself to go cry a little and get back to work."

That leaves them with little options to satisfy their sexual urges, porn or apps.

Then bumble has girls making the first move, me and you know girls hate to make the first move because they rather want to be chased.. the only dating app thats somewhat successful now is Hinge, and theyre making the app worse now and way more expensive.

My guess is that the stock will drop hard by late September when Trump and the DJT insiders to a stock sell off when the lockup ends. Also, assuming Trump loses, DJT could drop even harder, possibly all the way to 0. I currently hold puts at 10 920, 12 927, and 7.5 11725. I sold a 15 927 for 46 capital gains, but in hindsight, I should have kept holding to ride the stocks volatility. Anyway, TLDR, DJT all the way to 0!"

President Trump is subject to a lockup that generally restricts the sale or transfer of his shares until the earliest of 1 six months after the closing of the Business Combination 2 the date on which the closing price of Trump Medias stock equals or exceeds 12 for any twenty trading days within any thirty trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the closing or 3 the date after the closing on which Trump Media consummates a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of Trump Medias stockholders having the right to exchange their equity holdings in Trump Media for cash, securities or other property. As the result of a business combination transaction the Business Combination with Digital World Acquisition Corp. completed on March 25, 2024, Trump Media became a public company and commenced trading under the symbol DJT on March 26, 2024. If my calculations are correct, then 150 days after 326 was 823, so then we start counting days where the stock closed above 12 no need to count it was every day. 20 days after 823 is this Thursday 912. No surprise that the stock is rising in anticipation of the Presidential debate, but it may be getting to an attractive price for a DJT sale by DJT himself as early as Thursday or Friday. If for some reason the stock plummets below 12 following the debate, then the lockup should be lifted on 926."

I do not think the bullshit direxon or equity option on bond funds are good ideas when there is a flat to normal sloping curve and the fed has already broadcast the direction of future policy. It takes very little to hedge equities with long duration as a pure play and that is EXACTLY why stips and zeros existinstitutional money managers use them the same way. Derivatives on these sold to retail investors should not even be legal. Youre getting taken advantage of. You cannot time exogenous shocks and thats what it takes to get large moves in long duration, you just want to own some unless its an obviously bad idea to be a buyer like when rates are near 0. Its a perfectly reasonable time to have the security in your portfolio, not the derivatives hoping for moon shots. EDV is actually a purer duration play and you can see there are really two historic events when you would have benefited greatly from the hedge GFC, COVID. These are not things you can time. Duration is a powerful, but boring tool. When to own it is a real yield question. People shouldnt expect a large move over the next year without an exogenous shock. The 6T in money market funds and excess risk assets does not flow into long duration, it flows into the front end of the curve for safety. Long rates broadcast genuine sentiment and they will move before the fed, and before a flight to safety. It was an exciting time to add the position at 5. 3.75 is normal. You really need to be at the extremes to time an aggressive rate bet as a retail investor and a flat curve is pretty much the worst time to do that, especially an otm call after a 125 basis point bullish move before the fed even blinked. The policy moves are going to change the front of the curve much more than TLTEDV, and there is limited upside in short duration."

That or you just read the grizzly report and believed it I dunno. Bad Product...1000lbs heavier than Joby Its true midnight is heavier, but Id need more information to understand why this would strictly rule out competition with Joby. The Midnight airframe is very specifically targeted at slightly shorter operational routes and urban air taxi service compared to Jobys design. Additional weight could be for stability, passenger features, or the use of cheaper OEM parts instead of custom design. They have not demonstrated full flight. the video here pretty conclusively demonstrates a full size Midnight airframe flying. I would like more information about, specifically, the Flight Data Im aware Joby published data about noise in conjunction with NASA, but Im not sure if thats specifically what youre referencing here? Additionally, USAF took delivery of a functional full size Midnight airframe I am assuming that they would not take on a full size vaporware. Founders are business leaders vs technocrats Gonna be honest here, my entire OP is about why this isnt a bad thing, more on this in the next point. using too many vendors and integrating them is a huge problem. This is how the entire aerospace industry works, not a huge problem. Archer is able to source from so many companies because those companies exist as suppliers to aerospace companies already. this article covers the divergent strategies between ACHR and JOBY in depth Of note But when it comes to their specific manufacturing strategies, the two companies have staked out sharply different paths Joby is vertically integrated and largely develops its components and systems inhouse, while Archer is pursuing a more traditional model by relying on a roster of Tier 1 legacy aerospace suppliers. The article goes on to quote Adam Goldstein specifically saying that they are aware that an IKEA aircraft as you call it is an 80 solution but provides a significantly superior market entry point. Uber Elevates engineer is even quoted as speculating that Joby will eventually divest from its full vertical integration. nbsp Again, this point and both ACHRs quotes and the note that no aerospace company comes close to the level of vertical integration Joby is pursuing is exactly what my post is about ACHRs path to revenue is WAY more clean than Jobys Stellantis investment is all shares I cover this in my OP. ACHR has far fewer outstanding shares than Joby even after considering a 400m issuance to Stellantis through 2030. Their plant is going to stay idle for a long time Why? Even if theyre not fully certified when the plant becomes operational, ramping up will take time and they have a global orderbook including shipping to international customers which may have different certification timelines or requirements. Keep issuing more ESOPs and founder has left Admittedly, I dont know how significant potential dilution from this is, but usually, ESOPs arent so massive as to completely shift the dynamic of investing outcomes. The founder left to start new companies after having a fallingout with the board, yes, but he hasnt ever publicly trashed the company or even corroborated claims of it being a PR Scam so maybe he just didnt like it and went to do something else."

I do think, if youre patient, simply buying the 2026 options will be wildly profitable. Per my thesis in this post, I do think Archer is currently undervalued by a significant margin. By October, ACHR should announce entry into and timeline for For Credit airframe type certification, and confirmed that their georgia plant remains on schedule. I admit October is aggressive, but I have seen significant hype spikes in the sector before. I may need to reload in October for more January 25... According to currently known timelines, we should know by January whether ACHR and JOBY will really start operations during 2025. Once they have confirmed type certification by EOY and rolled even one airframe off their main assembly line, there will be major investor FOMO. nbsp By EOY 2025, or whenever actual first revenue generating sales or flights take place, we will see ASTSlike price movements."

ACHRs cap is about 1.26bn, of which about 450m is cashshort term assets. This leaves about 2.7bn and .8bn in speculative, long term, and IP patent, tech value respectively. nbsp Joby has fully acquired i.e. owns the IP H2Fly Hydrogen powertrain, Xwing autonomous flight, and Uber Elevate ElevateOS for ride ordering. Moreover, Joby has customdesigned nearly their entire airframe. When combined with speculative valuation from successfully entering operations, this value seems fairly reasonable. Even in a bear case, Joby potentially has multiple outlets to offer itself for acquisition or pivot to another method e.g. conversion of existing planes to hydrogen and autonomous flight. nbsp Given the IP disparity Archer designs its own battery packs and some other components, along with the actual airframe of course, my thesis is that Jobys IP and slight schedule lead are now diminishing in relative value compared to Archers actual business plan. Jobys IP stack is cool, but certifying custom build, and operational scaling are going to be harder than for Archer... With certification and operations set to begin next year, Archers superior orderbook and market plans should be valued equivalently to Jobys IP lead at this time. nbsp TLDR Joby fair value for their IP stack and superior product ACHRs superior market entry plan and order book should be worth more now, as risk of complete failure diminishes and likelihood of going to market increases."

                    "text": "Yeah Ive seen this and the only substantive issue, especially in the year since this report was published, may be the facility monitoring, Ill get back to that piece in a bit. Overall, and ironic considering their claims of ACHR being misleading, I find the report to be pretty deliberately misleading itself. Top line, Archer has clearly built and flown at least several completely functional Midnight airframes since that report. Regarding the USAF contract Archer has since delivered a fully functional Midnight airframe to the Air Force. Its true that they are behind Joby, but thats always been the case, and I am assuming neither the FAA Special Airworthiness Cert nor the USAF would take delivery of a scam product or vaporware at least, not a full airframe. The USAF potential order for airframes is not a substantial piece of ACHRs overall order book or operating revenue plans in any case, but I dont see why they wouldnt be able to deliver on the relatively small order if USAF continues to pursue it. They mention ACHR contracts with USAF related to autonomous flight and other highertech initiatives. I do find it likely ACHR will not continue as a leader in that space, as Jobys technology in these areas is indeed superior, as I mention in my OP. These contracts are a fraction 30M or less of the main eVTOL initiative there in any case. Highlighting these as potential losses is misleading in the context of ACHRs main business. Grizzly consistently mentions the dollar value of exercised warrants and share awards in the context of the obviouslyinflated price of August 23. While yes, those shares may be worth a considerable amount if ACHR succeeds in going to market, Grizzly leads with very large numbers attached to those share issuances while barely mentioning how unusual a price above 7 is for ACHR. Also as I addressed in OP, Grizzly talks up Joby throughout, but Jobys total share dilution is over double ACHRs total outstanding shares to this day. While there may be valid complaints about dilution, its outrageous to be in up arms over the issuances when a key competitor has done so much more. They obliquely imply that the companies investing in ACHR are doing so because theyre being given an opportunity to sell out of the company at the inflated share price. Stellantis has since continued to agree to investments in the company, with direct sharesforwork programs to ramp manufacturing. This is a pretty clear rebuttal of a number of points made by Grizzly. nbsp Regarding the manufacturing, flight videos, and overall progress being clouded ACHR has ramped up PR and specific posting of facilities and progress on the Georgia plant. Midnight clearly exists and clearly flies, including a more recent 10 minute unedited flight test video, an exact rebuttal of one of Grizzlys issues Where they posted a similar uncut Joby video. Its also a little odd that Grizzly was complaining about editing to make a flight appear longer in a video that was already only 042 seconds, which... okay? The source who claimed 2028 was Optimistic for certification is clearly not tracking how overall sector is making progress. If thats the case, Joby would be on target for 2027 at best also, and they have a complete custom ecosystem to certify, not just offtheshelf parts. Both companies, in the year following, are maintaining target times and presenting percenttocompletion that still targets 2025. It is possible still that Archers certification will be delayed to late 25 or 2026... I do find it worrying that they are still a little handwavey about their completely compliant for credit airframes being ready to go or in testing. I have addressed schedule risks several times when posting about the sector and ACHR specifically. That said, since August 23, their main Georgia plant is clearly progressing and they maintain the EOY timeline for completion as of this quarter. nbsp The claims about doing on site observation of the airport are at least interesting. However, its notable that the week they spent observing was exactly when the full size Midnight was built but not yet FAA certified. This timeframe lines up with the archer engineer saying they would have to wait as I find it rather plausible flight tests were paused between completion of the Midnight full size prototype and its airworthiness certification note that the continue to test flight daily were from prior announcements that occurred before their observational period I also have very little faith in the reports of supposed eyewitnesses when they are being asked about things by a literally activist shortseller company... Maker and Midnight are both quiet and small airframes, unique looking, true, but also short range. A full test flight could occur over the space of an hour or less, so even daily test flights may be missed routinely by people simply on the same airport grounds. Note that Grizzly did not consult or reference FAA Air Traffic Control, flight plan logs, or other possible authoritative sources for air time. Moreover, the empty facility they visited is very definitely online given that actual photo and video from the manufacturing process has been posted, and, again, at least several operational midnight airframes exist including one that USAF deemed acceptable for delivery. nbsp TO BE CLEAR I am not saying ACHR is definitely a superstar company thats going to be shitting out eVTOLs into the air taxi market next year... I just dont think that the piece published by Grizzly is a reasonable analysis."

                    "text": "First of all, if youre holding shares, you should be fine over a longer time horizon, this is around where we should bottom out... why ACHR is valued how it is right now Archer and JOBY, and all other eVTOL companies except EHang in china, are prerevenue companies. In other words, theyre spending money on RD but havent yet begun operations. Archer isnt actually selling or flying airframes commercially yet. As a result, traditional valuations such as PE, Dividend return, DCF, and other methods are either difficult or impossible to apply as a valuation mechanic. financial information such as cash burn rate compare to likely start of revenue generation substitute for this as a risk indicator. It does have generally nonbinding commitments for airframe sales valued at 6bn, as well as plans to selfoperate an air taxi service. Along with projected growth in the new Advanced Air Mobility sector, archer is theoretically well positioned for massive growth when operations do begin... Conversely, two major risks remain to getting operations. Most notably, type certification from the FAA saying the aircraft can fly passengers, and scaling of manufacturing supply chain and completion of main assembly line. Theres also a wider risk of a lack of infrastructure to support Air Taxis or the sector simply not catching on as something the public pays for. Essentially, the value of the company is then Possible major growth as a first mover in a new industry minus risk of catastrophic failure. Investing long term is saying Im parking money here knowing im speculating on success while short selling is saying i think the risks here are too great, and this company will fail before reaching operations. Why, specifically, its current exact value? Well, per my post, i have no idea and think its undervalued, so i am invested, but other people clearly have assessed the risk profile differently. nbsp As to why its red or green on any given day... its generally red and low priced when no catalysts or news comes out... Archer is very much on the hook to be much more concrete about its schedule, and soon, or the perceived risks grow a lot... many people are probably getting scared off by the relative lack of news given the supposedly tight timeline to start production. it goes WAY green when catalysts hit... new deals, timelines being confirmed, advances in certification progress, etc... that is, when the likelihood of future revenues increase and risks decrease and investors pile in. nbsp EOY prediction... Given the above and the fact that i am heavily invested in Oct and Jan calls. whatll happen? Basically two possible routes 1. ACHR begins for credit FAA type certification flights and proceeds quickly due to having mostly off the shelf parts i cover this vs Jobys custom build in my OP, and completes its Georgia manufacturing plant. If both of these occur by EOY, we probably go back to near 52w high 7 if not higher. 2. Any delays, setbacks, or major negative news occurs, or radio silence continues, and price continues to tank as investors look for shorter term gains and are unwilling to keep money parked in ACHR while it struggles to get running. nbsp Past EOY 24 to EOY 25 If they succeed in an entry in service date by EOY 25, that is, commercial operations begin, then we get to see an ASTSlike move in the price, as retail and institutions surge in on the hype train. This may be dampened a bit if Joby enters service earlier especially if Joby begins operations and encounters problems with operations We may see pops much earlier in 25 if nonbinding order agreements become binding as a result of Certification. 6bn in confirmed order backlog would be MASSIVE compared to 6bn in uncommitted orders. Conversely, if for credit testing begins but they faildelay for some reason, price tanks back to 3 range. If manufacturing plant has delays or failures, or production stalls due to supply chain issues, commensurate reduction in share price. nbsp Overall if you have shares you have several strategies Very long hold, as the Bull case through 2030 implies explosive potential 10x or more in share price, more if we get meme price spikes Sell on hype taking profits next time really good news comes out... then either be happy with that or rebuy when price slips between good news announcements. nbsp why do i have shorter term options? Well i have shares too, the short term options I play are very much gambling... but, as i describe above, this very speculative tech sector can see impressively insane hype spikes. Great news about beginning for credit testing or new orders or firm commitments, all trigger runs past 5 to 67. The time between now and EOY 24 is absolutely critical for the stated timeline and therefore speculative options could pay out massively. If price spikes, i also take out Strangles add puts to the mix to account for bad news and price drops."

And i maintain that ACHRs potential revenue streams and overall risk profile justify a valuation similar to Jobys minus Jobys cash advantage value nbsp I suppose if you assume all revenue generation will be pushed to 2026 or later, ACHRs cash position is more concerning, but because total shares are so much lower, the dollar for dollar dilution of long run profits 2030 or even 2040 for shares if achr does another funding round is still unlikely to be a major factor... additionally, ACHR may be able to sell airframes overseas to committed customers who are able to certify in their own jurisdictions especially Saudi ArabiaUAE, and both companies are likely to be able to operate overseas nbsp Still, absolutely, this is a speculative industry... but look at ASTSRKLB for example, very similar trajectory and similar background of prerevenue speculative tech that finally went live.

I was going to make a post about this earlier today, but work got in the way and now you come along with this great explainer, Ill just put my 2 cents in a comment. To the uninitiated Starliners failures were in its RCS thrusters, which basically control how its oriented and the direction its going. They got very lucky that the failure was able to be controlled enough to dock with the ISS. I am not sure if luck will be on their side again. Not only did Starliner not originally have autonomous descent software in it, but these thrusters will also control how it reenters the atmosphere. There are a few scenarios that could happen 1. They dont fail again, reentry goes off without a hitch 2. They fail in such a way that causes the reentry profile to be too steep, causing it to burn up on reentry. 3. They fail in such a way that causes the reentry profile to be too shallow, causing it to take multiple orbits to slow down enough for atmospheric capture, altering its final destination and even possibly causing scenario 2 to happen. 4. They fail in such a way that causes it to crash into the ISS. This one is much less likely from the basis that NASA is even oking it to undock, crashing into the ISS would not just endanger the lives of everyone on board, but also cause rifts in global geopolitics they dont call it the INTERNATIONAL Space Station for nothing, aint no way NASA is risking this. Scenario 1 is boring and does nothing for all of your puts. Scenario 2 and 3 I believe would cause a lot of panic selling. Boeing has reportedly been adamant about the astronauts using Starliner still despite these failures, and if its destroyed upon reentry all anyone will be talking about is holy shit Boeing almost knowingly caused another Columbia. Then again, I know more about rocket science than Ill ever know about stocks, and I only know the very basics of rocket science."

The fundamental problem with your thesis here is your making a macro call and then trying to apply it to a discrete event occurring very shortly. Even if we agreed that theres power concerns, fiscal concerns, concerns with the overall model of AI, concerns about chip manufacturing and ability Its unlikely any of that is on the ballot on the 28th. Whats going to be the concern is revenues for this quarter hitting towards the top end of expectations or exceeding it and then projections for the upcoming quarters Now maybe some of those issues feed into projections but I sort of doubt it. These are longer term problems, so Id be more willing to bet they become an issue over the next 6 to 18 months rather than in 3 days. So its a pretty regarded take to make based on the thesis. TLDR If you want to make a macro AI thesis you should put the time frame for it to play out at longer than 3 days. More like 618 months."

They perform far worst and there are not many libraries available so now you create two problems . The lack of support from libraries creates a difficult where you gonna have to either write your own library which requires time and resources from engineers or use the libraries that are already available but you have to jump through so many hoops to make it work and guess less performance that now you wasted time and money . Lets say you try to hire the top of line engineer most of them already have experience with CUDA , if not its easy enough to learn but if you go anywhere else and try to build in house now you gotta add the time to develop and optimize the library to work as good as a CUDA GPU . So its just cheaper and easier to buy NVidia . Even these big companies like META are buying NVidia .

Thats very significant even if it isnt the end all be all. The reason companies continue to buy nvidia is that currently the economics of it are more efficient than labor. Labor is extremely inefficient so its an easy milestone to cross. Think of the buildings and infrastructure and management required for staff. Then there is all the cars driven to work, all the ACs turned on. All of that is the price of labor and its a lot more than just a salary.

Most of them havent been costeffective as compared to nvidias cards even when taking into account nvidias margins, arent as easy to scale, and have no compilers or DL frameworks to use around them.

But GPT read and responded in 5seconds The critique youve provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AIs current trajectory and potential. 1. AI Approaches and Progress The critique dismisses the GPTML approach as a known dead end, but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While its true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fictionlike fantasies e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S., this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT3, GPT4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries. 2. Exponential Investment for Linear Gains The notion of exponential investment for linear gains is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of whats possible. 3. Business Case for AI The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an allencompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decisionmaking, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable. 4. Training Data and Resources Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resourceintensive nature of AI. 5. Nvidias Role While its true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust softwarehardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidias role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete. 6. Investor Expectations The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and longterm potential. In summary, while AIs development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a bubble fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock."

Its kind of like the Tesla story a couple years ago. Company hits scale in a new market, competition emerges and issues start to crop up, so theres a limit to growth upside. But valuations are assuming fairly substantial continued growth. So the upside is minimal and downside risks are elevated. Not something Id take a huge position on, but worth unwinding long positions and maybe a speculative put or two in a large enough portfolio."

I use the latest models every day for programming and it seems like every week theres something new that can solve some problems the previous model couldnt solve. The current state of the art is focused on improving training and making a corpus of training data have better results. The gains are spectacular. Microsofts Phi 3.5 mini came out last week and has 3.8B parameters. It outperforms Llama 2 70B from a year ago on benchmarks. Thats almost 20x less parameters and possibly training time. They did this by improving training methodology and making training data higher quality. So methodology is leading to huge improvements. Hyper scale companies are continuing to scale wide AND implement these methodologies. This means each generation is getting better and better and we have a while before we get to scraping the bottom of the barrel of the gains."

You can look up what folks like Sam Altman were saying 5 years ago. Here he is in 2019 openly saying they have no real path to profitability and once we make AI good enough itll just tell us how to make a return. A year ago the entire field was bristling with excitement about AGI and superintelligence, its a relatively recent development that theyve walked expectations back. Theyre just doing the fusion power is 5 years away thing. Heres Sam himself talking down GPT4 2 months before it came out and a couple months ago saying its mildly embarrassing at best and heres him saying largely the same thing nearly 6 years ago The current thing is always good enough for some tasks and the true AGI future is just a few years away. The issue isnt that it takes time, the issue is in 2020 when they released GPT3 theyd raised less than 100m, and today theyve raised over 13B, and they dont have a lot to show for that extra 12.9B. Sams talking about burning 50 billion a year to build AGI and its just got people wondering how many rounds well have to go on this before we get whats actually promised. At the end of the day its not his 50 billion to burn, his company isnt profitable so its gotta come from other people who arent going to keep ponying up if theres no progress to show for it. Obviously the AI sector is bigger than OpenAI, but theyre the best example. True AGI would be worth near infinite investment, but 400B for the current state of AI wasnt worth it, the longer this goes the more investors will just see it as throwing good money after bad."

Its been the best seelling EV truck of the year so far granted theyre just getting through the preorder backlog, but people are still completing their orders I have also been seeing them everywhere in person and also everyone around me is constantly mentioning it or talking about it. Positive things and negative, tbh mostly negative but imo no news is bad news the more people that hate on it the more people will eventually find it and like it, the haters dont realize theyre only contributing to its success. Everyone is making videos or talking about it constantly and you can look at any celebrity and they all seem to have one. self driving cars already exist with companies like Waymo, tesla is not far behind. Watch some videos of the newest version of their FSD and youll see how advanced it already is. It can gauge complex situations like accidents or animals running in the road and is often driving better than many humans I know. yes there are companies who are selling real robo taxi services right now one of which being waymo. But if you see the difference of what theyve completed compared to what Tesla is achieving you would be surprised. The current existing robo taxis have tens of thousands of dollars of sensors on them and are geofenced to small mapped out areas. Tesla is selling their vehicles for less than the sensors alone on those vehicles and teslas will eventually have nongeofences full self driving. The calculations are being done in real time by AI trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of real time driving footage from real people. Once completed a Tesla will be able to encounter any road, any situation, anywhere and solve it where as the other companies are focused on tiny areas just to get it working. Thats not to put down what theyve done or say it doesnt have its place but Tesla is aiming for something on a much greater scale and once completed will most likely take over the entire market."

Regardless of the speedbumps along the way, I see an eventual full transition to electric or at least 90 of vehicles on the road. Not to say we wont have major issues to deal with, I could also see the mandates getting rolled back in certain states. The goal of the electric car is to never have to think about charging it, eventually, everyone will change at home when they go to bed, so why would you want to go somewhere to fill up? The only time most people will be charging away from home will be over long distances which is what superchargers are for and eventually battery tech will improve, we already have comparable ranges to ICE vehicles. The new model 3 long range gets 363 which is more than my small Toyota. The 38 revenue from carbon credits is just from a recent quarter most likely because they have a backlog of them and this is a rough time for sales so they need to claim them in order to help prop up the business while theyre suffering. Tesla will survive long term. The vehicle sector of tesla is definetly the most prominent portion currently, but long term it will not be. That is why they market themselves as a technology company, they ened ot sell the cars to people first for them to want to purchase FSD eventually once it gets better. Having an EV will lead them down the road into Tesla energy by having battery walls installed or solar tiles on their roofs. The energy sector profits more than doubled last quarter for tesla, this is the beginning of the transition of profits into other sectors. Teslas are already cheap enough a new model 3 costs about the same as a toyota corolla, not to say 26k is cheap by any means. I definetly wouldnt buy one new but a lot of people would the F150 is the most popular vehicle in america and costs 45k. People will be happy to switch once they learn about the benefits, right now there is a lot of boomer hate against sustainable things and EVs and that will change as the young generations take over and become wealthy and settled into thei rjobs and can make the transition. In 20 years kids wont believe that cars used to run on gas and didnt drive themsleves."

I agree they have the potential to take away market share from tesla but Im doubtful on how much. Right now Tesla already has dominance in the US EV sector so it will be tough for the Chinese cars to break into the market at first, if they can even get here. Most US politics are against giving too much power to the Chinese and I think part of why Elon is being friendly with trump is because he is betting on him tarifing the shit out of those Chinese EVs so theyre more expensive than Teslas. I agree with competition will get stronger stronger no doubt, supposedly BMW even surpassed Teslas quartet EV sales in Europe recently. But nobody in the sector is as diversified as Tesla, cars is just one aspect of their long term game plan and theyre already dominating. Also nobody else is working on self driving like they are which will be a huge game changer once completed. Why would you buy a cheap Chinese EV once Tesla is the only true self driving, or why would you buy a car at all if you can order a Tesla to drive you to work for a fraction of what an uber would cost? The teslas are getting cheaper and cheaper, right now you can buy a Tesla model 3 for 26k after rebates, thats getting as cheap a Toyota Corolla, which has nowhere near the tech features. Think of apple, how many companies have better devices than them with better features and cheaper? And still iPhone is the most sold smartphone in the us, its not always about being the best its about knowing your consumer and how to appeal. I know several people who extreme liberals and absolutely hate Elon and everything about him and even they own teslas and admit there is nothing else on the market like them"

The majority of his promises have been kept... are you actually this stupid? I am happy there are people like you that continue to believe in this delusion. Even now. After all his epic failures to deliver, there is still one more thing he will trot out to give you, and you will believe him. They are right, the market can stay delusional longer than you can stay solvent when you are short. Thankfully, I just put on this new short two days ago. And I am still in the green.

Is it possible the reason he couldnt deliver was because of Indias regulations, laws, or import fees making it unfeasible to ship them there or manufacture them in the country? The promises I am saying he has kept are the ones related to his pay package, he declared he would not take a salary in 2018 and instead he wanted a 1 stock option ability to purchase shares at a lower rate if he could take the market cap of tesla from 50 billion to 650billion and he did it and took it to over a trillion and even now after beaten down its still sitting at 800billion market cap. Why would he do that if he didnt believe in the company and its ability to grow, why would he take more stock options instead of just straight cash if he knew the company was going to fail? The earnings call that I listened to as well seemed to be very straightforward and he was clear to not make promises he cant keep, he even admitted on the most recent earnings call that he was wrong about when FSD would be completed and he didnt want to give an exact date because he doesnt know. To me, it shows hes trying to be honest and when he does make promises he keeps them."

This place is a big echo chamber of antielon and antiTesla just like Twitter is an echo chamber of proelon and proTesla propaganda. I believe the truth lies somewhere in between, I think too many people hate Elon and therefore hate Tesla, not realizing there are 100k employees some of the smartest in the world in their respective fields working towards this future. No other company is operating at their level and has done as much as they have. TSLA is going to be worth whatever people are willing to pay for it in the end. I have followed many stocks here and people have been saying TSLA will go down sub 100 for a while and then it made a run to 270 and is currently on an uptrend. I dont know what the nearterm future holds but I believe in the company and want to share my ideas. I appreciate the criticism. I still disagree that he is a con man, I guess we have to agree to disagree. I will mention I have seen this hate before against other people like Zuck when Facebook was sub 100 and now its on its way to 600 and all those haters are gone."

In addition, theyve been researching AI significantly and releasing some opensource tools such as Google Tesseract, which derives text from images, whilst keeping the core stuff like Gemini proprietary they are a business, after all. Theyve also created a robotaxi which works Waymo, improving peoples quality of life whilst reducing accidents. Theyve also been carbonneutral since 2007 and are actively working to offset their carbon emissions from previous years, and they run a free video hosting platform with helpful recommendation algorithms to help people to find entertaining andor educational videos which theyll be interested in, although they do have a problem with shadowbanning. Theyre also lobbying to reduce regulations on the tech sector, increasing competition and innovation. Alphabet has probably done more good than any other company. So you could short Alphabet and buy Microsoft, which is like Alphabet except without the opensource contributions and theyre not carbonneutral or carbonnegative, and theyre lobbying to increase regulation on the tech sector to give their AI a monopoly and ban opensource alternatives such as Grok and FLUX.1schnell. Edit You could also short Eli Lilly LLY. They spend more on RD for lifesaving drugs than they make in profit. Also Tesla TSLA. Theyre market leaders in renewable energy and EVs."

You know, planning and brainstorming, like they taught us in high school. Then, once we have some sort of plan we can agree on, because humans can agree when they arent being greedy whores, we start to slowly enact those policies. Whatever those policies are should be compromise. My initial idea is that we could remove the limitations on automatic weapons so anyone can own anything, but we slap a hefty fee on anyone who wants to take these things off their private property. Go ahead, buy an Abrams with ammo as a citizen. But you must first own 100 acres without any neighbors within X miles and youre gonna pay these hefty fees if you wanna take it to a show, whatever. This is just one idea thats possible and feasible and a compromise. Ive come up with this in like 10 minutes several months ago. So we pay these people trillions and trillions a year, but Sandy Hook is no safer than it was when the tragedy happened? Okay. And look. My idea sells more guns, and more expensive ones to boot. Stocks are going up from it and the streets are safer. Hot fuck. 2A only protects your ownership of guns. It doesnt protect your ability to take them into public spaces. Nothing does, afaik. Buy whatever you want, but keep it home or pay a huge fee. And another idea here is insurance in case you do kill someone. All of which generate more money, not less."

If I can go 40 years and you can go however long and the next guy can, then most of us dont need to defend ourselves in public. Even with the rate of mass shootings, the vast majority of us dont ever hit a moment when we need a gun in public. Maybe a home invasion, sure. As such, it makes sense to me overall that if we pay so much money for both our rights to be constrained and also our public to be defended and also most of us live most of our lives without need, then, sure, insurance and a high fee to carry in public seems reasonable af, given where we came from and what were dealing with overall."

Okay, the states were not literally lawless 200 years ago. Some states did permit dueling, but that is its own thing with its own long, complicated history. It isnt a matter of lawlessness.

Honestly it doesnt matter if youre not buying at or below spot imo since what youre really getting with Costco bars is convenience and security from fakes. Plus gold prices have been going up these last few years. If you had extra cash laying around that you arent using anyways then you can throw some into gold if you fancy it certainly is better imo than pokemon cards, jordans, INTC stock, or gucci bags.

NVDA moved from 90122 Now i am saying be cautious and dont chase this rally. Pre market futures were jumping around like a cricket. Since July ,we have ben told to rotate out of mag 7 into small caps , and we have seen a vix spike to absurd levels.We have been told we were entering a recession .We have been told ai hype trade is overextended and to get out of ai stocks.We have been told by a a few so called reputable firms like Goldman and Boa that a recession is probable .We have been told that the yield inversion curve never fails to predict a recession and now we are being told a yield uninversion suggest a recession is at hand .We have been told the sahm rule being triggered means a recession is about to happen .We have been told valuations now matter.We have been told the yen carry trade needs to unwindI am sure I am missing several more conflicting things we have been told . Now I want to say what I think is reality. A If valuations really mattered the whole market will sell off. B The VIX is still elevated and I have never seen such a wide swath of confusion in my life.I see market gyrations that look very volatile and I think a potential for a flash crash is very elevated . P.S Japan is moving forward with their rate hikes and I wonder just how much more this yen carry trade unwind will resurface ? something structural is wrong with the markets and I think its going to manifest in an ugly way Suggest taking profits August until October is typically a sell side event for the market see last years chart The rebound was a v shaped just as i stated and as such it also can reverberate as the underlying cause is still without clarity but probably related to the yen carry trade. The odte power to influence stock prices and the dark pool profiting off violent swings is very lucrative for the hedge funds . A few other factors but when the VIX spikes and the market corrects, the bulls and bears are like two boxers in the 5th round of a 12 round match and both are strong with something to prove. I dont think we can say all is clear and i put odds of violent swings at very elevated right now... We have conflicted media and no real agreement on valuations and absolutely no sec oversight or else the VIX would not have spiked to 65 in a healthy market The algos will dump trillions in market cap in hours the vix could spike right back to 29 for all we know at the moment"

The platform generates revenue through its freemium business model that offers a free version of its service and a paid version called Discord Nitro. Discord Nitro is a paid subscription that offers users enhanced features, such as higher resolution video, screen share, animated avatars, and custom emojis. Discord also generates revenue through server boosting which starts from 4.99 per month for Level 1 and costs up to 69.86 for Level 3. Server boosting is a way for users to upgrade a Discord server to have added perks and benefits such as better audio quality, larger upload limits, custom emoji slots, etc. Discord also partners with game developers who want to sell their products exclusively through the Discord platform. Discord earns a 10 commission on every game it sells, using its profits to reinvest back into the platform."
