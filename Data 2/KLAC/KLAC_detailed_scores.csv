Reddit,2024-08-01,"Your table is missing a key piece of data, analysts usually give 12 month price targets, so how accurate did the analysts price turn out to be 12 months later? Also some websites chart out in a graph both what the analysts average price target was, and where the stocks price went overtime. When you do this for some stocks, like T for example, it shows that analysts consistently call it pretty undervalued, and yet the stock also consistently under performs the market andor loses value. By your logic stocks like T would have been a good buy, even though history shows that you would have lost a lot of money in it. On the flipside meanwhile stocks like NFLX and TSLA would have been called dreadful and highly overvalued investments by analysts at various points, when it was actually the best time to buy those supposedly overpriced stocks.",Neutral,0,0.6505180597305298,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,Ill be honest its really not. I came to knowast year that NVDA was priced above 700 pre split but I was scared and only invested in QQQM. It then crossed 1000. I read about analyst ratings about ISRG. I invested a small amount after some research. It has gone 20 since then and has been solid despite tech sell off. I think analyst ratings is helpful to screen companies and not go tits up. I think what is usually lost is that they give a price range and typically most of us dont take risk into account and just invest blindly.,Positive,1,0.9921824336051941,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-01,Not true. Take a look at stock OTGLY. Its video game company CD Project. It has gone up 40 in last 3 months. Yet I researched and 8 analysts think it is a sell and 4 say it is a buy. I still invested because I follow the company and think there is a significant upside and current analyst opinions are recency bias. So I believe analyst opinions are a piece of information.

Reddit,2024-08-01,No one has crystal ball. Again I find it is useful to screen stocks. To follow their arguments for prices. Regarding other question I agree that it cant be 100 right. But some of the opinions are behind paywall. But you still get to see the consensus buysellhold. Also some banks etc are publicly traded right?

I actually make something for this company that involves High Ultraviolet Lithography, I believe for the production of computer chips. I work with lasers, and we do some very advanced work. We don’t always know the end use or processes that are kept secret and are proprietary. What I can tell you is that the demand on these items has exploded; from maybe 8-10 a year, to near 100 a year. This is a costly item to produce; each one is thousands of dollars. I’ve been making them for about three years now. The increased demand on this part is what made me take a look at this company and subsequently buy stock in it. It’s been one of my best performing stock in my portfolio. I’m  long on KLA. My question is can anyone offer more insight into this article I attached? I’m a pretty smart guy, but most of this is over my head as it relates to advances in technology and what it means for the company.",Negative,-1,0.9881190657615662,Main

So an investor in the 28% marginal income tax bracket would see in increase in capital gains taxes on KLAC stock sales from 15% to 28%, almost doubling the tax owed. Ms. Harris also proposes, with Mr. Biden,to impose the tax on &#34;unrealized&#34; gains, on KLAC stock that an investor owns but has not yetsold. The unrealized gain tax would be imposed on higher earners.Mr. Trump lowered personal income tax brackets across the board in 2017. Those reductions will &#34;sunset&#34; (end) in 2025 if they are not renewed. Mr. Trump wants to renew them. Ms. Harris avoids the subject, but Mr. Biden has expressed disdain for the 2017 reductions. The increased standard deduction would also sunset.
