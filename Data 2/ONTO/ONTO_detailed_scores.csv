Reddit,2024-10-26,Why Cancel shares instead of convert to Treasury shares during Buyback?,Neutral,0,0.9992651343345642,Main
Reddit,2024-10-26,"Treasury shares are a sneaky way to reissue stock to management, which is often to the benefit of managementdirectors, and detriment of owners shareholders. At the same time they use this mechanism, they use another where by they reserve a block of shares every few years for issuance as payment to managementemployeesdirectors. Treasury stock comes in especially handy here because they dont have to file any SEC notices or make any public statements, like you would if you were issuing new shares to cover the same scheme. The company can buy back enough shares each year to compensate for all the shares they are handing out cheapfree to insiders. Its an actuarial magic trick. From a birds eye view, it doesnt look like dilution. Its even a great sound bite buybacks, hey look at how much we care about owners! but shareholders are very much losing out in the long run. Buy back shares at market rate through the front door, with owners money. Hand those same shares out the back door at bargain basement price to managersdirectors. Shazam! Share count stays about the same! Ever wonder why with record earnings something like a 70 yr high record earnings, companies are still only paying dividends that equate to at best 4 no better than a 10yr US Treasury? Wheres all those record earnings going? Oh look, the CEO found a bunch of extra shares that fell off the back of this DEF14A truck, at half price....",Neutral,0,0.9921411275863647,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-26,"I dont genuinely know the answer to this. My guess is that the point of a buyback is to increase the value of the outstanding shares. Its a way of returning capital to shareholders. Cancelling the shares increases the degree of ownership of the company that outstanding shares have, which implicitly means their intrinsic value increases.",Positive,1,0.9972624778747559,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-26,"You are complicating it too much. Share buyback and issuing dividend are identical, while issuance to insider is the same to paying a cash wage. With the exception of tax purpose ofc. Generally speaking no one is losing out in the long run, its just really annoying if you regularly sniff through their financials. That been said there is a magic trick, a lot of compensation, especially ones offered to Csuits, are tied to stock price. This means buybacks directly increases CEO compensations compare to dividend, which can be especially bad if the shareholdersboards are less financially sophisticated. E just remembered share issuance is also better for cashflow, but thats about it",Neutral,0,0.9321428537368774,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"My guess, as someone who loads up in whenever its in the 2s is as follows... Im invested on the premise that at the core, peloton is a robust subscription business with a surprising amount of customers willing to pay a surprising subscription fee. For some people, a month of classes with a sub fee thats the same as one single in person class, that is great deal for them. And peloton apparently allows 2 users on a sub I think, so it works well for couples. It doesnt matter if 98 of the population hates them, they can make bank selling 40 subs to the people that dont. I would never pay it, but there are millions of people who like to have a trainer, a coach, an instructor yelling at them. Peloton fills that niche. Anyway, for those of us invested our thesis is peloton should get out of building and shipping and selling hardware and focus on the subscription since thats working well. We like when we hear things about them lowering their inventory of bikes. So my knee jerk read of this announcement is mixed. Yes, its encouraging to have such a prominent distribution partner, but essentially it could be seen as getting back into the danger zone of building and selling hardware again.",Positive,1,0.8939798474311829,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-22,"I sold it all on the top tick of the day, but a large part of that is my own discipline of selling large moves that are more qualitative than quantitative. Sometimes often? when a stock has giant move like that, all of the buyers of the last several years are solid green and they tend to take profit. Long term bag holders sometimes take the opportunity to dump their holding too. I am looking to generate gains in this tax year, so I have been looking to sell it if an opportunity arose, and I didnt want to gamble with it falling back and have to sell at a lower price in December. I know full well that it could continue to surge today or next week, but I can live with that. So for me its not about whether PTON is worth this price, but that this was my long term target when I was buying it under 3. Since then, theyve apparently gotten more sensible about their overall business plan, established a partnership with COSTCO, affirmed the stable subscription business, lined up the next CEO, and gotten an endorsement from a hedge fund legend who has a hot hand David Einhorn The CEO choice is tantalizing because Apple has been rumoured as a potential buyer of Peloton. Apple buys companies this size all the time. Apple is to increase their seeking subscription business. Apple is trying to make Health and fitness their thing. So naming an Apple Fitness guy as CEO just supercharges hopes that Apple could buy it. If PTON drops in the near future, Ill scoop it up again. Its a lot less risky than it was, and is looking more viable as a takeover target too.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"202021 Bubble where everyone thought every EV company was the next Tesla. 2024 A number of EV companies that went public via SPAC or otherwise in 202021 have gone bankrupt some for the second time and others have been obliterated. I think theres a decent chance that RIVN is one of the few smaller companies that gets through this difficult period but what does the other side of that look like? I think it could be okay but will probably disappoint a lot of peoples expectations. I would be surprised if it ever gets back to the peak. In the shortterm, how low does it get before a rebound? Theres a view that a Dem victory would be positive and perhaps it is initially, but everyone also thought in late 2020 that green energy was a sure thingeasy money and piled into it only to have January 2021 be the top in things like ICLN. I think too many people are still looking at EVs like its the 202021 disruptive growth bubble while the market has returned to the view that the auto industry is a competitive, cost intensive and generally not great business and EVs dont change that. I mean, look at Aston Martin flirting with 0 again would be bankruptcy 8. Musk has said countless times over the years that the auto industry is an incredibly difficult business and that Tesla has narrowly avoided bankruptcy at times. The automobile industry has not been good for investors, with a couple of noteworthy exceptions 1 Ferrari, because its an ultra high end luxury company that happens to sell cars and 2 Tesla, because of whether you like him or not Musk.",Negative,-1,0.9974504113197327,Reply

The most recent cvswalgreens failing. most of their clients died of Covid19 Are you so hungry for something else that RIVN is worth a loss nobody likes a loser their cash management is not the best but yours might not be as well. You can slowly enter into something else over time and the pain is way less than buy all now and wait then you can stay current on that companies status, never buy a share without looking it over first. As long as you have extra money coming in you can always add more to what peaks your interest......if you sell All now Id sell half at a time if you need the money for rent you could very well be entering another turd. The question you really need to ask yourself is why you really need the money???? Apply yourself in real life services to make as much money as you can and then take that extra and invest it. It takes time in the market to gain and RIVN as well as the money you threw at it are only a few years invested. I see Rivian vehicles driving around where I live so thats a start. Most EV is having trouble getting parts right now I believe TSLA is prioritized based on sheer volume of the parts they need thats how businesses work. but TSLA cant monopolize the market and not everyone will want a Tesla but they are the cheapest but still not as profitable as Mercedes Benz.

Reddit,2024-10-19,Why did you hold so long as that is a big drop to stomach? If you sell immediately to tax loss harvest and buy it back on 30 days you may miss the rise in shares if the Dems win in November which will likely be good for EVs and green energy companies. Might want to wait it out since youve waiting this long and the election is less than a month away. If you are sick of the name and seeing the red in your portfolio move on after the election because there are better opportunities. If you like the name buy the equivalent share amount now and then sell the expensive shares in 31 days to tax harvest.

I think he was looking at the Board of OKLO at the time and hearing rumblings of these small reactors to power AI data centers and thought it could be a good play. There was definitely luck involved in the 40 pop in a day, but I think he was looking at it as a play for the ancillary businesses to AI, like selling the pick axes and shovels.

Its that reactor facilities have been designed with passive safety in mind to prevent operator error from ever causing a disaster, and the next generation nuclear technology takes that to another level.

I have FSD HW3 which is nearing end of life, but Tesla will be capable of far more advanced computations with HW5 for the robotaxi.

Reddit,2024-10-07,"There technical limitations to using cameras that go beyond needs more data. The point clouds created by Lidar data are precise measures, capable of operating at any level of light, and arent hampered by various sources of noise in the surroundings which can cause problems with cameras, such as lights and the like. Further, stereoscopic measurement is essentially inference IE, not a direct measure of distance or timing, but rather on an inferred model based on parallax and relationships. Lidar will always be more accurate than a camera for the simple fact that Lidar is basically a direct measurement, whereas cameras for such cases are an indirect method. You can get fairly accurate with optical cameras, but never nearly so was with Lidar. Stereoscopic and orthological mapping using cameras is processor heavy far moreso than Lidar point clouds, requires more time for data processing, requires actual light to be present, and can get confused by stray light sources. While both have limitations, particularly in rainy or foggy conditions, these limitations are generally the same.

More important is the actual cost to waymo per ride, including amortization of hardware, software and dev costs. Because that will determine if its actually a viable business model or just another silicon valley solution in search of a problem. My guess is its not. Drivers arent the only cost to a taxi business and do a lot of stuff you take for granted cleaning, arranging servicing and off duty storage etc. Self driving taxis remove the driver cost but then add in a whole bunch of extra costs cleaners, fleet managers etc plus the rather sizable costs of the extra hardware plus software and dev costs. If its viable at all it would only be at huge scale with immense capital costs. With the inevitable low margins its hard to see who that business would appeal to. The benefit to the customer is also marginal. Is your driverless taxi offering your a significantly better service or outcome than a drivered one? No. They both get you to where you want to go for a small amount of money. Thats it. And for cities they will simply make congestion even worse.

Optical methods with cameras perform poorly in low light conditions, and require orthological modeling to determine distance. A lot more can go wrong with optical cameras than Lidar in determining distances due to the far, far more strenuous processing requirements of optical systems that also tend to be far less accurate. Its a bit more apt to say that cameras dont have any particular advantage over Lidar at all aside from cost, and Lidar is a more reliable system overall with fewer fail points to be concerned with. It has some similar limitations in terms of fog and the like, but the biggest difference is that Lidar gives actual distances well, they give actual time between shooting the laser out and reading it, which is innturn calculated to a distance whereas cameras infer distances you have multiple overlapping images that create a 3D model that you can measure in.",Negative,-1,0.842420220375061,Reply

Automatic text translation just by looking at foreign text. Neat, sounds pretty SciFi. But were already in a world where I can aim my phone at the same text and have it translated in 3 seconds without putting any adspace directly on my eyeballs. Automatic vocal translation. See above. It will work just as well as your phone already does. Youre paying a 300 premium to avoid looking at your phone for 20 seconds. AR art displays. Youre going to see a black box unless you pay to unlock it. Exceptions with complex context like the Never Hike Alone movies aside, no one makes unmonetized creative work. No one. Even if someone tries, Zuck will slap an ad above it. Where do you think youre seeing an AR art display for free? Public AR profiles that others can view, displaying achievements or whatever. Wow, how useful for society. Leaderboards are never toxic in video games, so sure, why not bring them into real life? All the obvious gaming, photography, and video use cases as well. Hooray, more entertainment! Thats great, I was just thinking I didnt have enough access to TV shows and video games and shit. Basically anything you currently do with your phone but never having to take out your phone. Lmao. This device can do everything that 4 other devices you already own can do. 300 please. Dont forget the protection plan, insurance, and monthly payment for Plus content. 419.35 12.99mo please. What do you mean is Plus worth it... dont you see the obvious benefit to constantly consuming different content on each lens? Youll also only have to see 1 ad per hour, where normal users have to see 5, and 2 of them are video! OF COURSE PLUS IS WORTH IT!!",Neutral,0,0.9999028444290161,Reply

Having played significantly with OCR Optical character recognition trying to apply it for a project at work, I have no faith at all it could translate the text on random signs into another language. It likely wont even get the original language right. The AR art displays is an interesting idea though. I could also see it being used as an enhancement for Pokemon GO style games. The other thing you have to think about is that a lot of this processing would need to be done locally by the glasses.

Reddit,2024-08-04,"Saw an interesting stat post earnings this account is a good follow if you want META specific analysis. META Family of Apps made 58.8B in operating income last 12 months. In the same period the Reality Labs segment made a 16.7B loss. Without the RL segment, META would have made 75.5B in operating income. At current prices the stock would trade at 17.6x operating income. METAs earnings are stellar and this is despite this massive moneylosing segment. If the bet turns out correct, huge upside to earnings. If it turns out to go nowhere, well, you get a natural boost from not throwing money into a black hole. Zuckerberg has a history of excellent capital allocation given the success of this company. Hopefully he is correct on this. Im skeptical of VR Also, its interesting to point out people were critical of META doing buybacks in 2021 before the stock had collapsed. The highest stock price META had achieved before the crash was 380 in September 21. Today the share price is 490, or 30 higher. If you call that 3 years between then and now, thats a roughly 9 annualized return. But we can actually look at their actual buying price. From this source the average buy price in 2021 was 330, which comes out to 13 annualized return. So the buybacks during seemingly bubble territory turned out to be decent capital allocation in the end. The SP 500 is only about 20 higher than its peak valuation, so those buybacks were marketbeating.

Reddit,2024-08-04,"I took a massive position in meta last week, just before the crash. Wish i had waited a couple of hours as the jobs data came out and the stock price crashed... but overall im bullish. Its a great company. It has good leadership, meta has managed to stay ahead of the curve for the last 20 years and its still growing. Metas suite of products are still relevant across multiple generations and their platforms are generally considered the most effective platforms for ad spend. Meta is also competitive with other players Google, apple etc. For instance, the AI lama chatbot that theyve introduced is actually pretty good... and they have big ambitions for it to be the most used AI tool by December. Im reasonably certain they will be able to monetize AI directly and indirectly... directly though AI powered ads maybe tiered pricing or subscription models and indirectly through more precise data analysis, efficiencies etc. Their VR spend is pretty excessive IMO but it looks like Mark wants to create a new paradigm for interaction and has high conviction in this investment. To be honest, until VR is made significantly more comfortable to use, its not going to take off, but I think they are working on creating hardware that is more comfortable to use. Im not as skeptical as I used to be, and I can imagine a lot of use cases where VR could be very useful. For instance, I live in a country 25 hours away from my immediate family. If theres a VR headset that allows me to feel like Im meeting my family in close proximity in a VR holiday location Id be game. But this is contingent on all of us having comfortable head sets and price continues to be a factor that they will need lower to see mass adoption of VR. The AR glasses though, I can see more immediate value and uptake. Im considering buying them now. Im bullish on the stock in the medium to long term 12 months 48 months. I have no idea what the stock is going to do in the short term given macro environment. But they are well capitalized to weather any storm, have a reasonably manageable amount of debt, and print money. Their most recent profit was over 13bn. In. A. Single. Quarter.

Reddit,2024-08-04,"Ive watched multiple of his speaking engagements and Orion presentation. Hes on a roll with all that publicity and his image. And I think what I said was exactly right. 10 years away from those glasses being replaced as the interaction tool. Phones will slowly become the brains of the glasses. Im very bullish on Facebook. I think the glasses will go through a hype cycle. Just like absolutely everything does. We are climbing up to the peak and will reach there in about 23 years. And the next 5 will be steady slow progress with not much fan fare. In about 8 years youll have bigger adoption and mass adoption in 10. My point on reality labs was in regards to his Metaverse. Which he has started to let go of. I was maybe wrong that he cant let go. I think he realizes its not the near term goal and in 20 years when a virtual reality tech is better , then he can hype that back up. He is now distracted with a better more tangible goal. So ya it took him too long but hes got a shiny new toy now. Meta has a lot of money to play with until they hit gold. And inevitably whether its glasses or llama or something else they acquire. Theyll get there. I do worry a little about Facebook itself. Its a corpse of a product and in 2030 years I dont think will exist as we know it. I can see it pivoting to some sort of login page. Basically Facebook could become the login screen to all the other services they provide. And remove the social aspect as the main feature. But the old Facebook of uploading pictures and walls is going to change. Facebook gets a facelift. The first quarter where users decline is when theyll start working on it. But this is a problem where they have many years to fix. If I was mark id be putting a team of 6 super smart people focused purely the future of Facebook and prepping for its complete reimagining. Because its going to die. And he should be ready to replace it. Its still a huge huge chunk of their revenue. Cant ignore that. In fact as amazing as glasses sound.

To play any resource heavy games you have to plug the headset into your desktop and basically stream the screen to the VR. Which Ive tried, and it isnt consistent. Its like playing cloud gaming. Its acceptable for demos, but youre not going to use it long term for a game. Plus, you need a high end computer to do this in the first place. You might as well just play the game on your pc. And no one that wants a VR is going to buy a PC and a VR to play one. It just doesnt make sense. So youre limited to stand alone games. Which at the moment, is Beat Saber. Thats pretty much it. Lol.

Reddit,2024-10-27,Everything youve written is pretty much spot on. Not sure about the downvotes either. Here are some answers The most common purpose of an emergency fund is to cover your personal expenses in the event your main source of income suddenly goes to zero. The recommended 36 months should depend on the expected time for you to secure a new job. For example if you are a fast food worker it may be shorter vs. an executiveCEO it may be longer. It will also depend on the job market in your industry. One risk is that the sudden loss in income can come during a recession when many others are also looking for employment. In this case it may take longer to find another job. The US would pretty much need to default on their debt for SPAXX to tank. Very low likelihood in the next 10 years and beyond. This is fine to invest in as you say you would then only need to cover the 13 business days for the money to transfer to your checking account.

Additionally, while many conflate items like repairing a car and replacing a hot water heater with using emergency funds, its often because people forget to plan for semi regular expenses rather than a true emergency.

This is just like keeping some money aside for any unforeseen expense say you have an accident or say your refrigerator broke down or you have a major car repair to deal with or a health emergency. I think you did not understand this basic purpose of emergency fund. The emergency fund is not intended to earn good interest or return, so thats not a consideration. If you still want to put it in highinterest earning accounts, good for you, but thats not the objective. I agree with your point about having credit card to cover emergecies but thats also how people get in to a debt trap I dont need to explain this you know it. Lastly for some people I understand building 36 months emergency fund is difficult. For example for someone earning 5000 a month and having 3000 a month expenses, the suggested emergency fund would be in the range of 9000 to 18000. Saving 10,000 or more is not easy in the context of high inflation and lifestyle expenses we have today. So the way to get to atleast 9000 is to set aside regular sums every week say put in 200 a week and by end of the year you will reach the 10000 mark. Its not like one day you wake and say I will put 10k in emegency fund, its a slow process.

Reddit,2024-10-27,"The 36 months of expenses in an emergency fund thing is basic advice intended for people who are not particularly financial savvy and need things stated in extremely simple terms. Since this is rinvesting, this deserves a more nuanced discussion than most of the replies youve received so far have contributed. We should be able to understand things here like opportunity cost, max historic drawdowns of asset classes, etc.. We also should have a good understanding of our actual income and expenses, what the risks are to our income sources, what the value of and risks to our assets are, what expenses can be adjustedeliminated over time in the case of a long term loss of income, etc.. I personally regret having followed the 36 months advice too literally when younger. It was money I never needed and never came close to needing and wouldve grown to much greater levels had I invested it instead. People will respond that I was just lucky and what if, etc., but really it just turns out that in those downtimes, you adapt and adjust and find solutions. Besides myself, I cannot think of any partner, friend, family member, or coworker that I am aware of a situation where they ever needed six months of living expenses within 13 days. Never. I cant even imagine a scenario where that would happen. All of this gets down to specifics of your personal finances and situation, so no blanket statement exists, but I dont think it is hard constructing an investment portfolio for an emergency fund that properly balances risk and return, perhaps bootstrapping it with some percentage of buffer above historic max drawdown for that asset allocation. The fun thing is watching it grow over the years past that buffered amount and beyond, eventually getting to the point where even a historic market crash would leave you better off than if you had played it safe by stashing it in a low percentage rate bank account.",Neutral,0,0.9718104004859924,Reply

And its not hard to use a credit card to cover immediate issues and then liquidate x amount of stocks to cover that within a week or month. Vs keeping that money permanently out of the market. If youre in a position where your investments cant cover an emergency anyway then all this is moot. I dont recommend using a margin loan to most people but if you have the room and are comfortable with that level of risk its fine. If I have 50k in assets and I take out a 5k loan Im not getting margin called even on a 50 overnight drop. Which also wouldnt happen. But if you really want to fear the worst I guess you can think like that. Youre naively sacrificing long term wealth to have a permanent tail risk cover. And at that point you might as well take out that margin loan and use options to secure any downside protection in case on a fall in the meantime.,Neutral,0,0.7046718597412109,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-27,"The idea here isnt to run a razor thin margin. If youre going to take a margin loan you need to be able to ride out volatility. If you cant do that then its a bad idea. Theres risks either way. Either you risk not having as much growth or you risk bad downside timing and tail risk. Not everyone has the same risk tolerance. I would just as well use my credit card and pay the interest on that for a couple months if I had to. Youre basically saying that these loans are bad to take because a black swan event could mess you up financially. But it will do that regardless. The difference is that youre not taking that margin loan long term. Where as the goal would be to keep it in that hysa for at long as possible. At the end of the day is just about risk tolerance. I dont recommend you take a margin loan for any reason. But if youre educated on it and comfortable with the risk reward for doing so, emergency or not, go for it. Theres a lot of different ways to handle the same problem. I use a credit card. Then pull from my brokerage to cover if necessary. Edit I will add that market crashes dont just appear. They have indicators and warnings leading up to them. At had a ton of news coming out about China before it hit. Gfc had a LOT of indicators that the housing bubble was prime for a shit storm. Dot Com bubble had a mountain of red flags. But youre right the average investor isnt looking for these things or trying to protect against them. And yeah all this is easy to say in hindsight.

Reddit,2024-10-19,"Lets say you make 5000 a month. Of that, 2000 goes to rent and bills, and 2000 goes to other expenses like groceries and entertainment. This leaves you 1000 a month. At first you want to set aside that 1000 a month in your savings accounts exactly what youre doing until you have about 6 months of expenses saved up in case of emergency, which in this case would be 24,000. The money in your savings account will make a little bit of interest, but thats not an investment. Its more of a loan that youre making to the bank, and theyre giving you a little bit of money for the privilege holding your money. An investment is when you own something of value. You could invest in a car, but the value of that car would likely go down over the years. You could invest in a house, and the value of that house would likely go up over the years. The issue with these investments is that theyre not liquid meaning, you cant really do any much with the change in value. Your car may be worth half of its initial value in 5 years, but that doesnt make you any worse off. Your house could double in value after 10 years, but that doesnt mean you can take a trip to Cabo whenever you want. What most people refer to when they say they want to invest is they want to own part of a business, they want to share in the profits and losses of that business, and they want to be able to sell that part of a business that is, liquidate it to have more liquid money to take a trip to, say, Cabo. You could invest in your own business sink 100,000 into a commercial property that youre renting to clean up, design, and open up a restaurant. If this restaurant is successful, it may make 10,000 a month in profit. Now, you can do one of two things with this profit 1. You can withdraw it, put it in your own bank account and take a flight to Cabo this is called taking a dividend, but be aware that you have now decreased your restaurants value by 10,000 in order to increase your personal wealth by 10,000 2. Or you can use it to build out the patio of your restaurant to accommodate more customers and then make 15,000 a month in profit, so the value of your restaurant has now increased. Now, again, you can either take a dividend, or you can reinvest it into the growth of the company. But starting a restaurant takes a lot of upfront work. Whats a lot easier is buying a part ownership of an already existing business, like the graphics card company NVIDIA or the retail company Costco. If you buy a share of NVIDIA, you are entitled that tiny fraction of value of the company, but you should be aware that its NVIDIAs policy to reinvest its earnings, because its in a growth phase so the value of your shares grows, but you arent making money. If you buy a share of Costco, you are entitled that tiny fraction of value of the company, but you should be aware that Costco pays out dividends because its not in a growth phase so youre making money, while the value of your shares stays the same. Theres no wrong answer, theres just what you want to get out of investing. But what if NVIDIAs competitor AMD comes out with a new technology that absolutely crushes NVIDIA and causes their stock to tank? Its risky to own single stocks. So what you can do instead is buy a share of a mutual fund, which contains hundreds or even thousands of stocks. For example, with my personal excess savings I buy shares of VTSAX, which contains shares of all the publicly traded companies in the United States. It doesnt matter if a couple companies lose value, because Im confident that most companies in the US will be doing well and growing over the time horizon I plan to hold this mutual fund for a couple decades at least enough so to outweigh poorly performing companies. So if you want to invest in a mutual fund, open up an account with a brokerage firm, such as Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity, and set up your account to automatically withdraw a certain amount of money each month to buy a broadbased mutual fund like VTSAX or you can buy individual stocks like NVIDIA, or you can buy ETFs, which are somewhere in between. With VTSAX in particular, over the next few months youll see the value go up and down, over the next few years youll see its value go up slightly, and in 1020 years those mutual funds will be worth waaaay more than what you paid for them, so you can sell them and take a hundred flights to Cabo.",Neutral,0,0.9997538626194,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-12,"It sounds like you have a fortunate family from a financial standpoint that have all made good long lasting financial relationships and have had success with working with financial advisors to manage their money while they have spent time in the business or work earning enough to have extra to invest. That is a powerful combination they have accomplished. It appears your parents and grandparents have consolidated on a set of accomplished advisors. I would move your money to that set of advisors so it will be together with their future gifts. Frankly as much as you like your financial advisor and how helpful he has been to you, you are not a drop in the bucket in his gross income, so he is losing little financially by you moving away. I suspect you are a likeable guy and he is doing it as much as a friend as anything so will be sad to see you go, but will wish you Godspeed and success as you leave.

We appreciate your help and guidance that got us this far and were ready to take over from here. Then you move the investments to your own account wherever you set it up, such as Fideltity, Schwab, etc. by telling the NEW custodian to move the assets from the old one.

Reddit,2024-10-12,"When I first started working, I always thought I need a FA for investments and I had even asked my colleagues. I was so naive that I kept all my money in savings account paying almost nothing. I moved from another country so I didnt have any clue on IRA and my employer didnt offer 401k. I researched on my own and eventually opened IRA but still was naive enough to not contribute every year. Eventually, I became more intelligent. Just before Covid hit, I was looking at investing 100k that I had been saving. I thought its a big amount, I need a FA to help me invest properly. I met few but wasnt sold on any. So, I decided to do it on my own and I am glad the portfolio has been doing good. Over the last 4 years it has been at least matching SP. We now have a brokerage account, HSA, 2 Roth IRAs and 2 401ks. All retirement accounts have 3 funds FSELX, FXAIX, and VTI in 106030 allocation. I have also learned to feel, one needs a FA after 5m assets or if getting a 1m inheritance. Not only is that a life changing amount but one also needs to do proper tax planning. In your case, I think it is safe to assume, between your parents, your wifes parents and your grandparents, you two are likely to get significant inheritance combined mid 6 figures or may be even more. Hence, having a relationship with a FA would be beneficial. Id speak with both your grandparents and inlaws FA.

Google isnt going to give competitive prices and are going to give it to the highest bidder which automates it very well but it is up to the advertisers to create the ads and hope that it can target the right person.

Im a huge Shiller fan, That being said his 3rd edition of Irrational Exuberance came out in 2015 calling a top and lower expected future yields. That hasnt exactly manifested.

Reddit,2024-08-25,"The stock market is stupendously overvalued by historical standards. The US debt is stupendously high by historical standards. Thats probably not a coincidence. The US hasnt experienced a true multiyear bear market since the 70s. Ever since the the US kicked off its 45 year deficit spending under Reagan, stock markets have been levitating. Even at the worst moment of the Great Recession crash, stock prices merely flirted with their longterm fair value. Otherwise theyve been floating on sunshine. Weve seen the past 23 years how a sudden surge in deficit spending can cause asset inflation. But the 45 years of Federal borrowing likewise caused asset inflation, albeit not as sharp and spiky as recent inflation, and helped keep stock prices overvalued for most of my lifetime. That was possible because 45 years of rising debt was canceled out by 45 years of falling interest rates. The two led to a fairly stable interest payment. Now that debt is exploding while interest rates are high, interest payments are likely to devour the Federal budget in coming years, forcing Congress to pass some form of debt reduction. When that day gets here, the 45 year old stock market boom is heading for a slaughter of historical proportions.",Negative,-1,0.5548163056373596,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-25,"Finally, remember that the Shiller ratio divides the current price by the trailing 10year average earnings inflationadjusted, so it will overstate the PE when current earnings are above average. It has always done that. And the reason is earnings are volatile, and they grow very steadily over the long term. So taking an average over a long enough period gives a good approximate for where earnings have been at. Also, the normal PE ratio has increased over the decades due to more capital looking for investments in the stock market. That still raises the same concern. Theres more capital chasing returns, which raises risks of having lower future returns.",Negative,-1,0.667751133441925,Reply

Hey, see far too many people getting an M1 A1 Abrams and then coming to their first bridge and realizing there 25 tons overweight. Do your research people. In realistic news, I have some cash but not a ton. I took a big beating recently on our last downturn in some options. But if you make risky plays you need to be okay with consequences. And I am. I would say bonds like any sensible person in the last hundred years. But the Fed has got us so twisted around I cant fucking make sense of the bond market. I really don know where interest rates are going. It should be ABC easy. Rates coming down. Where are bonds going... The bond market hasnt been this confusing for me since I started investing. And the few times Ive kind of dabbled in it. Ive gotten burned and this is the bond market! I shouldnt feel like I am running risky options. Theyre bonds! But I still say stocks. ETFS. Where are ppl gonna put their money? Theyre weird times with a handful of wars grabbing attention, the usual malcontents in Asia, home prices are...pure insanity and the housing market is candy land. Thats another thing. The housing market has been a leader in pushing and pulling and dragging down the economy as the case demands. And were so twisted around that I think we kinda have to wait for the boomers to die before those houses go anywhere. You got all these ancient people with mega mansions that they should be looking to downsize, but their mortgage is Maybe a third what they could get in the market today. And their price on their house is something they cant get from any buyers with a small version of their house costing a fortune. They have no means of selling unless they want to take a financial bath and I mean a really wet bath and so I think theyre just gonna die in these mcMansions. And thats a really huge chunk of the economy thats just frozen. And not a lot of people are talking about it. Theyre just saying yeah housing costs suck. Mortgages suck. But That has a massive effect on the economy when people cant buy houses and cant relocate and theyre essentially stuck with incredibly valuable inventory they cant offload I dont know who to blame, but I dont see any quick fixes. Kamala, bless her heart, was talking about a 25k down payment credit. Cool. I can buy a really nice doormat. That 25k would cost a ton to finance and I think it would have little effect somehow, I know that corporate interests are going to be the ones who take advantage of it.

Reddit,2024-10-26,"Because of the concern of reissuance, the goal of share buybacks is to lower the number of slices of the pie. The pie stays the same size so each slice of the pie is worth more. In other comments you mention treasury shares are not counted towards number of slices. This is only true from an accounting perspective. The financial reality is probability based. If the company has 1 million Treasury shares, and a 50 chance to issue them, the market will discount each shares value as if it was 0.5 million shares were issued. 10 chance, then 0.1 million shares. Put yourself as CEO of a company, if you tell your shareholder we are buying back shares but we are holding them as treasury shares, what your shareholders hear is We are buying these shares and are probably going to reissue the shares at a later date so you will spend the same amount cash to buy the shares but get less increase in stock price for doing so.

Large reactors can use natural unenriched uranium and are easier to defuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. Theyre massive capital projects SMRs require enriched uranium, but theyre just built in a factory, moved to site, then theyre defuelled and buried when were done with them. Theyre very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse Brookfield corp have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience. My bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys. Im also invested in USbased Brookfield because its a great company like an infrastructurefocussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders. Small enriched uranium SMRs cant be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 530 enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia the nuclear gulf states. Uranium isnt the critical bottleneck you all think it is.

Thats why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place before it sold half to Comeco. The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost. Its because of this experience and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US.

I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 510 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item? Im not sure how Westinghouses revenue on reactors shakes out. Do they simply sell the reactor and its parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up? Edit Actually, I think I have that wrong. The supplemental information Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under Sustainable Solutions. Which page 8 shows is only 5 of their FFO. Either way, Im at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 510 additional reactors to their financials and the share price.

Would personally rather buy in once announcement hits the tape andor we get more concrete updates wrt SMRs vs larger reactors.

Reddit,2024-10-22,"Oh, the AP1000 is a great design, as youll see downthread on the other reply to my comment. Definitely the best LWR design currently on the market. But the nuclear industry always claims that theyll learn their lessons and the next build will be smoother and on time and budget. And it never is. Basically every plant built in the 70s and 80s in the US had huge overruns, and many were cancelled after TMI. Even Watts Bar took much longer to complete than expected. Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland were similar. Frances original build out in the 70s was similarly over. Taiwan ended up cancelling the ABWRs in Longmen, and that was after a dozen or so were built in Japan. Unless youre an authoritarian country, or maybe South Korea, youre very likely to take far more money and time to build every large nuclear reactor. This time wont be different.

I would imagine because of the fraud cases I linked above Westinghouse is no longer trusted to directly manage the construction work. Either way, CCJ is much better positioned to be impacted by the development of more nuclear reactors, in my opinion, because BEPCs portfolio is much more diversified with renewables whereas CCJ is more of a strictly nuclear company.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"great stuff. Its my biggest holding. imo theyre trading at a very attractive valuation based on their uranium business alone. the rare earths business will make them a significant player on that front in line with MP materials and lynas while offering the added benefits of additional uranium supply from the rare earth mines at practically no additional cost and qualifying them for potential rare earths related US govt funding as they try to reshore their rare earths supply chain. lots of investing options to play the uranium thesis but UUUU is pretty unique in its combination of current and proven production capacity, ownership if a uranium mill, US based company and production and diversified ventures. Theres lots of companies talking big talk about future productions but the sector is plagued with delays and production forecast revisions. Its not easy to produce uranium and energy fuels has proven they can do it and are currently doing it. the fact that they currently produce and are ramping up production also offers them way more torque to rising uranium prices as they occur rather than betting on market conditions remaining as favorable for an entire decade.

Reddit,2024-10-16,I actually bought into this company when I bought URZ Uranerz who were bought by Energy Fuels. Kept buying small 100 shares over the years. When Covid hit and the market tanked I actually bought some for 1.20 a share. My dollar cost average was 3.89 for all the shares purchased to that point. Recently after this past summers stock I bought a big block of shares at 4.90. I honestly have not been able to get my head around the fact that analysts arent upgrading the stock based on a TON of different revenue streams this company will have access too. In fact one analyst downgraded the stock from MKM Roth who i might add doesnt have a great track record imo. What am I missing ?? What are analysts missing ? A lot of it iI believe is they are sworn to secrecy with DOE DOD and various other agencies as well as other countries they deal with. They cant inform until they announce earnings and even then there are no specific details given. I believe in CEO Mark Chalmers. Hes implemented the plan and theyre in the process to initiate plan. Hes making it happen with a lot of smart people they have acquired from recently acquired companies as well. In this respect he can continue to monitor uranium which he has multiple decades of experience and delegate other duties to people more qualified then him for REEs and medical isotopes divisions.

Reddit,2024-10-16,Going back to 2019 Im finding about 100mill shares to start to current times. I do see that hasnt been updated on many brokers though despite UUUU already having completed the necessary SEC filings. Hope that gets fixed soon. This should be as a result of the share conversion and monetary dividend given to base resource stockholders in order to acquire base resources. In February 2020 the share count was 114milliom shares right before covid hit further driving the stock down in already bear market conditions. The shares outstanding from December 2020 to July 2024 prior to the completed disclosure of the base resource shares dilution acquisition the stock went from 131 mill shares to 163mill shares. A dilution of 30 million shares over 3.5 years or about 10 million shares a year. However the majority of those shares were sold during 2021 with minimal share dilution after November 2021. For the next 3.5 after that there was a dilution of 1.5 per year equaling about 7 million shares added to the float. Im using December 2020 as that is the period of time when the stock came out of a bear market and began the current overall bull market rally. Sales of shares from prior to then I consider to be during the Uranium bear market conditions of which dilution was done for the company to survive. Edit for comparison UEC has nearly doubled their float from November 21 to today.,Neutral,0,0.9998533725738525,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-16,Theyre not a new company and miners dont do that.

After that Fukushima happened and a supply glut cratering the uranium price for the next 10 years until December of 2021 when it began to sharply rise. Almost every single uranium miner has to do share reverse splits and dilutions to survive that decade bear market and is why pretty much anyone in uranium ignores anything prior to 2018 or so.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"As the author of that post I agree with the idea around the headline number, ie reporting a beat. Just a couple things to point out about this company. They have totally run out of levers to pull and now seem to be flailing around trying to create the illusion that they are somehow going to be involved with autonomous vehicles. That idea is absurd and will never show growth anytime in the next five years. Every time their investments are a drag on the headline number they are quick to point out that it was just because of one time paper losses while when they boost the number they dont mention the paper gains. The main thing the street is going to care about in this report is gross bookings, ie are more people ordering food and cars? I can guarantee that even with these paper gains if they show a disappointing number this stock is going to crater. I would not be shocked to see a miss there tbh even though those are very hard to predict quarter to quarter. Was actually in an Uber this evening and the driver said they are all revolting against how much Uber has been fucking them of late, gaming how much they get paid so the drivers are now rejecting rides unless they are over a particular amount per mile because that forces Uber to raise prices. The only thing keeping this stock in tact at this point is ultra low gas prices. Uber is an extraordinarily overpriced stock given how many risks they face.

Reddit,2024-10-16,"I see a mistake with this analysis. Here you are including the unrealized capital gains from investments as EPS and saying that it will crush earnings because EPS will go up by 200. But there is no guarantee that this EPS will be sustained in the future. In other words, a 111.74 gain in AUR shares is just a oneoff event. As I see it, if UBER sold all of his shares in other companies, he would get .79 per share. Considering that the stock has gone up by 10 in 1 month 7,33 per share those investments are more than taken into account. If they were not taken into account, we are looking here at a mere 1 increase. Perhaps it will skyrocket, but it would not be because of investments, or at least it shouldnt.",Neutral,0,0.9598926901817322,Reply

EPS generally reflects the companys net income from its core business activities, and unrealized capital gains are considered part of other comprehensive income OCI, not net income. ... In summary, unrealized capital gains on investments in other companies do not typically affect EPS if investing is not the companys main business. Instead, these gains are recorded in OCI.

Reddit,2024-10-15,"If you overlay interest rates overtime onto a chart with TREE, it essentially trades completely inverse to interest rates. I doubt its quite that simple. Their best financial performance was FY 2019 when they recognized 1.1B in revenue and their stock price hit 450 in June of that year. the fed rate in 619 was 2.4. From there, rates were lowered to basically 0over the next year, and kept there for the next two years until rate increases began mid 22. During that time the value of lending tree stock fell from 450 to 60. Again, the interest rate was basically 0 for the entire time. TREE was one of many overly hyped fintech stocks carrying a PE over 250 at its peak. Their financial performance never met the hype and the price fell as a result. As interest rates went down, so did their revenue. I expect them to do better moving forward, but I doubt the market rewards them with such ridiculous valuations again.",Positive,1,0.8290802240371704,Reply

IonQ raised its fullyear revenue guidance to between 38.5 million and 42.5 million. Additionally, IonQ entered into several strategic partnerships, including a 9 million deal with the University of Maryland and agreements with AstraZeneca and Ansys. The company also announced the acquisition of Qubitekk to enhance its quantum networking capabilities. Despite these achievements, IonQ reported a net loss of 52.5 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 23.7 million for the quarter. Its exactly as I said. Making a loss and only use cases being ones that are not really market based. Gov and University research. This is the kind of business and tech that only exists with subsidies. So sure, if you have confidence in those continuing and then finding some market for their product where it provides economic value go for it.. but swings of the stock price dont mean anything.

Reddit,2024-10-14,"You were the one who suggested in another comment that IonQ could have a proprietary QML algorithm. I would be interested in hearing the talks this week because I am not familiar with Yamadas work. For all of your talk that I am making too many blanket statements, you are assuming an awful lot about my professional experience. I would not idolize this industry if I were you Ive learned more in my two years out of private industry than my time in it. Ive also been able to stay more up to date. You say its incredible to think that QC cant help with AI, Id argue the exact opposite. 1 ML is inherently a big data problem, something QC is bad at because youd need to load in and read out data. Part of the reason factoring is such a good problem for QC is because it is relatively easy to load a 2048 bit integer. Whereas in ML youd probably have to load your training data, which would be expensive if you have a lot. 2 maybe youd be looking at solving some optimization problem related to training, at best that would have a Grover sqrt type speedup which would quickly get eaten by error correction overhead rendering it practically useless 3 current methods use variational quantum circuits and classically optimize them, which have no fundamental speedup and people can only point to heuristic improvements. These are on toy problems essentially. For large scale ML this would probably not work at all I mean youre free to consider this a larp and invest in this company with your current knowledge. With what I know about QC, I wouldnt. Then again I missed the crazy price spike this month so what do I know",Neutral,0,0.9554747939109802,Reply

Reddit,2024-10-01,"I applaud your comment. very transparent. I have not used cerebras so I was just going by the marketing on their webpage. What I am saying is that the information and their comparisons are very outdated as Microsoft has aggressively opened the throughput for the OpenAI models. One thing I will quibble with is that api limit is related to inference speed because it is throughput. In a way it is expected throughput as well. Heres what I mean. Previously when you used LLMs in Azure you would get a warning for tokens you could generate per minute if you went over the limit and then outright rate limiting would 404 your requests going forward. Now, to your point latency is what we are really talking about here. What I can tell you is that each model has its own latency expectations that Microsoft never publishes because if youre on a pay as you go service you are effectively on a shared service. What I can tell you is that 4 was terrible, 4turbo was a little better, 4o is a lot better and 4omini is perfect. In terms of latency. 4omini is a smaller param model. Tokens are complex especially in an enterprise environment. I am passing thousands of tokens through expecting thousands of tokens back on complex queries.

Reddit,2024-10-01,"Nobody uses Azure on a shared or dedicated service with a single GPU. Youre missing the point of how this works. GPUs are typically connected through NVLINK and networking, which increases throughput and reduces latency. With more powerful and interconnected GPUs, latency decreases, and throughput improves. In this way, throughput and latency are related, especially when processing complex models.

As chips get faster, training times will drop, and inference will grow. But with future data and models being larger and more complex, who knows how training will pan out.

Reddit,2024-10-01,"I think on Reddit and other forums you will always be able to selectively find an opinion which doesnt add much to the discussion. As you yourself have shown there is useful information there too and I prefer to look at everything both negative and positive and come to my own conclusions . For example the following link to a deleted video I hadnt come across in the couple of hundred hours of research I have done I dont know why the video was deleted , perhaps the female boffin wasnt photogenic enough... What cerebras have created is not trivial and not really that simple to recreate quickly . For sure its going to be expensive but its more in the league of supercomputing. Whether there is a market for it remains to be seen. Dont get me wrong , Im not a cerebras fanboy The chances of them taking significant market share from nvidia is slim but I dont believe its non existent. The main concern most people have is the g42 involvement and bulk of revenue. I think its a legitimate concern and will probably be the main reason for a fall in share price after ipo but I myself am not particularly worried by it. I think g42 have probably got a great deal , better than anyone else will get and they will stay on board while cerebras gets more customers.

Reddit,2024-10-01,"Thanks for sharing that video link. I hadnt seen that before. I am a preIPO investor in a similar situation as yourself and I try to get as much info as possible. My guess on that video is that it was deleted because someone thought it revealed too much too late, I guess. But I could see myself deleting it too, why give everyone a complete roadmap of your proprietary tech. Sure, they could figure it out anyways but let them spend the time and resources. You nailed the main risk on the company, the customer concentration is enormous, that is something they will need to work to rapidly alleviate, but part of the problem here is there arent that many entities that can write these checks and need the product bad and Nvidia has a lock on the 4 or 5 regular joes stateside, and those guys arent gonna turn to a startup for many good reasons. So its either you take on the rare big elephant when you see it, or you remain in little league. Nvidia, which is orders of magnitude the size of Cerebras also has high customer concentration. Perhaps as inferencing becomes a bigger part of the AI process there will be some changes on that in the sector as smaller players buy a bigger share of the sector output. But for Cerebras the combo of just 1 customer at the scale that is relevant for the IPO the geopolitical risk of that customer is too high to waive off. I think as investors one just takes known facts into account, pick spots not get too greedy, you know. The OP didnt understand many things. The idea that if US reduces export controls this is good for Nvidia and bad for Cerebras is incorrect. Actually, for G42 in particular, which is not just a customer but an investor in Cerebras, it likely accelerates Cerebras sales.

Reddit,2024-09-16,"This is a flawed analysis. The core app business is meaningless, in fact if they sold it for 0 the stock would go up because it dilutes the multiple.

This business has been growing every quarter for many years. They do rely on google and apple app stores which is a clear negative but given pressure from regulators in Europe and US wa potential justice department breakup of google, they wont F with Applovin their hands tied and cant be viewed as monopolistic. IMO this is a unique time where there is a window for Applovin to become much bigger. In terms of insider selling, a lot of these sales are for tax net settling of shares. But yes many others have been outright selling. CEO still owns billions of stock and many insiders still own large amount of shares relative to what they sold. KKR doesnt count, they 10x their money and their fund vintage was ending, so they needed to sell. You can also make same argument for META or NVDA, ton of insider selling there. Also the valuation isnt even close to bloated. They report GAAP earnings but if you add back amortization and stock based comp like every peer does, they are trading low 20s PE for a business growing 20 wvery high incremental margins.

Lol IMO options ONLY makes sense if you have a hunch or information you think is unappreciated or you are willing to play a 5050 chance. Like sometimes you just KNOW a company is stupid like with zinga or Groupon. And you can smell the mass psychosis. But that happens once every couple years. Other than that options are for hedging. Not investing. Nobody can predict short term fluctuations. So basically the opposite,Neutral,0,0.9976499676704407,Reply

This obviously limits the amount I buy but I really have not found a good way to manage these kinds of options. Its just place your bet, spin the wheel and see what happens.

Reddit,2024-09-07,"Well, this depends on how often the trades run higher. Or what it ranges at once it goes over your Depending on that, you can probably do a ratio. For example, let assume you buy two contracts at 1.00. If the price runs up to 1.30, you exit one contract to take the 30 gain. And for the second contract, you can choose to set a stop of 0.70. This will make the trade a breakevennot including commissions. Depending on how confident you are, you can choose to set the stop at 0.8, 1.0, 1.1,etc. All of them will give you a different pnl. So, the main thing here would be assessing how confident you are. The purpose of the first contract is basically to give you room for bigger moves if its possible. Scale up as needed. Alternatively, and Im paraphrasing here, git gud. Fine tune the setups your spot and set up extra trading rules to justify your exit at 30,50, etc. If the stock movement only complies with enough rules for a 20 exit.. then exit at 20.. and so on.",Neutral,0,0.999961256980896,Reply

Im in a similar position where I lost like 50 when I first started got some back, pulled some out for house buying during early COVID but since that mistake Ive 2xd SP over the last three years.

If I dont have an obvious ressitancesupport level Im playing off, I dont enter the trade. 2. Set very clear, and tight, mental stop losses, and dont enter trades where you cant set them, no matter what your gut says. Because gut feelings are amorphous, you cant argue effectively with them leads to confusion which causes anxiety and FOMO or panic about downside. As a general rule, I dont allow myself more than a 2030 downside on trades, ideally less. Dont mess around with trades where bidask takes you outside that risk. 3. Have a clear understanding of macroeconomics, global money flows, and how they relate to business cycles across different sectors, countries, currencies. Use that macro knowledge to check you technicals. 4. No pennies, clinical trial bio stocks, startups, IPOs, or other PD prone sectors. Dilution risk is way too high and impossible to predict. 5.

Reddit,2024-09-07,"The first rule of options is you never ever ever buy them. Youre always short. Doesnt matter if its calls or puts youre always short. This alone puts theta in your favor. You can trade brackets, support and resistance levels, expected moves, trends. Basically the first thing you want to set up is what securities or indexes youre going to trade. I recommend a large ones that are very liquid and arent going to do crazy things on you. TLT for example, we have a positive trend, we know rates are going lower so any type of pullback, especially a juicy one like 95 to 96 which we might not get, you short the 95 or 100 put, the higher value the put is the more time you want to give yourself. For example back when TLT was trading at 90 I set up a chain of shorts into 2026 with expirations between 90 and 115. Where am I wrong on this trade? Any type of reacceleration in inflation. Already up bigly though so any type of hint that anything isnt slowing, you start covering what youre up on. You do the same thing with companies. If you want high volatility, you have palantir, you have Nvidia, many others, stocks around 30100 typically are going to have a lot of action if they are movers. Short puts on selloffs, sell calls against your stock on rallies. You basically create a cash generator If you do dumb shit like long options, buying calls and buying puts. You have to realize that youre walking into a casino at that point and gambling so if you play lottery tickets and you actually win, stop playing. Ideally you set up your hands when there is some kind of catalyst for your gamble to actually work. When theres an actual strategy that over the next few days or week or something theres some event thats going to move it in your direction but you have to treat it like a lottery ticket, its not investing, if you hit a big one you can turn 1,000 into 50k and many people have done it. The problem is, when they go to try it the second time and the third and the 4th and now theyre back to 1,000.

Reddit,2024-09-07,"This advice is misguided. Confidence relies on how well you know your setup, whether your play is a fiveyear investment or a fiveminute day trade. You gain confidence to hold through pullbacks once you develop confidence in your setup strategy. That means you develop an exit strategy where you predetermine how much of a pullback you are willing to endure, considering a balance between your ideal riskreward ratio and your personality. Understand that some people are better at playing shorter timeframes while others are better at holding for longer. You need to define what makes you feel worse Missing out on those potential gains you couldve made, or seeing a profitable play become a losing play. Once you know, you shouldnt focus on how to make yourself withstand the biggest pain. Instead, focus on how to maximize your returns on the one youre inherently more comfortable with. In other words, you are assuming that you could make more money if you learned how to hold for longer. But in reality, you might do better if you keep getting out early, but you instead play with a bigger size or simply make more of those plays.

Reddit,2024-08-02,"Intel could go up or more likely stabilize if their Habana Labs acquisition finally pays off. Gaudi2 and Gaudi3 are fairly impressive for a variety of reasons compared with NVIDIAS HGX A100 and H100H200 servers, but they are facing an uphill battle on the software front and NVIDIA is still ahead overall, even if they were to end up failing to ramp up their B100 production next year. Intel gave up on competing in flash storage, high performance networking, and various other areas in recent years and bet on general purpose CPUs and their hypothetical fabs, and everyone with the money to do so is going to continue spend their budget on AI instead of their server chips for the foreseeable future. Their upcoming server CPU designs are not very well aligned with the shortterm 23 years needs of the market in my opinion. Their client CPU scandal isnt doing them any favors, either.

Reddit,2024-08-02,"TSMC opted against highend EUVs, as even at the cuttingedge 2nm process, it does not find it necessary to spend extra resources. Furthermore, Intel has minimal presence in processes below 7nm and is starting to sell off its fabs to stay afloat. Intel has even restricted ASML engineers from working onsite to assist with the process, which hinders any reasonable yield expectations. My prediction is that, after struggling to get the new EUV machines operational, Intel will sell its new facilities in Ohio and Arizona to TSMC.
