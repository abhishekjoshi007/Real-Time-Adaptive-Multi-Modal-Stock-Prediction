How is it that IBRXs accumulated deficit of 3.2 billion is more than half of SoonShiongs net worth, if he didnt deliberately saddle it with debt Im not saying he did Im just asking? 2. If IBRX only has enough cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through at least 12 months, doesnt that mean a share dilution is very likely in the near future? Wouldnt IBRX be cutting things a bit close if they dont do it within the next 3 months? 3. The stock price is lower today than it was when the FDA approval was given. What does this mean for sales?

Reddit,2024-09-08,"Hi. 1. Delays in approval play a part. Complete response letter FDA. Further, the enormous sales team comes with a huge price tag. Trials are extremely expensive, I believe 505k 150k per participant., depending on the type of drugtreatment. 2. Yes. Share dilution is possible. However, it is my opinion the will partner to create liquidity. Soon owns 80 of the stock, so he has in interest too. 3. Look at Akebia, Iovance, Coherus, Xfor and others that had PDUFAapproval. Approval means nothing, IBRX was in the luxury position of being able to ship 2 weeks after approval. Unique. However, the market still needs to be informed, trained, insurance deals covered. An approval, as with the given examples, are in indication of future value. Especially when it does not concern Big Pharma. 4. Keytruda and Opdivo I believe. If you look at Opdivo wiki, you can see a approval path I think Anktiva has the same timeline. 5. UK is my guess. Not fact. It is simply logic. The fastest to obtain. 6. UK approval, in my opinion, will go with a partnership. I do not see how they can not. If they do not partner, they will need to dilute. With Bio stock anything is possible. You have to be willing to see red. A partner can bee in many forms, but if this occurs there will be a big investment my guess 500,000,000 minimum and hefty milestone payments for each indication.",Neutral,0,0.6924513578414917,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-08,"ubamadesi Im not sure where youre trying to go with your comment, but Ill just say the following 1. If by bio business you mean biotechs as a whole, well nobody is ever going to be familiar with all of them, and each biotech has its own idiosyncracies and unique selling points. Therefore, we ALL need to read about bio business. Also, as far as getting familiar is concerned, asking questions here is actually part of getting familiar with the sector and learning more about it. Nobody has a monopoly on knowledge. 2 Big Pharma and biotechs are not the same thing. A financial win for a Biotech company may barely move the financial needle for a Big Pharma company thats worth multiples of billions, depending on the amount of sales of the drug. If a biotechs drug is not the only drug on the market for a given illness, the money made from that drugs market share will be limited, since the Total Addressable Market will be shared with the competing drugs. There are also drugs that most of the public who need them will never see, due to the unfortunate fact that those drugs are too expensive to be massproduced for the wider market. 3 A companys revenue is very different from its stock price action. Even when a drug is sold to the public, it isnt guaranteed to translate to significant stock price increase. If a biotechs stock price doesnt move much, then that biotech isnt attractive to private investors, even if it remains desirable for a big pharma company to invest in it.",Neutral,0,0.9990000128746033,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-06,"Actually, someone else, who doesnt have a monopolistic market position could step in and pay Apple to be the default search engine for iOS. IANAL but in short Simply being a monopoly or near monopoly does not trigger antitrust issues. The government is loath to punish a company simply for being successful. For a nonmonopoly provider, making exclusive contracts for placement or positioning of your product is also not something that would trigger antitrust issues. However, when you have a dominant market position, as Google has with Search, and you create exclusive contracts for placement of your product that exclude other providers, it can trigger antitrust issues under the Sherman Act. There are several remedies but the most obvious is the deal between Google and Apple to make Google the default search engine on iOS will be unwound. Instead, Apple will likely have to give iOS users a choice of search engines. Google will likely appeal so the final determination could be months or years away. The immediate impact once appeals, etc. are concluded is likely pretty small most iOS users will likely choose Google as their search engine because it is by far the most popular search engine across all platforms and has the best recognition in the market. Google still dominates on Windows where Bing is installed as the default search engine. One of the first things people do with a new Windows install is disable Bing, Edge, Cortana and OneDrive.

Macbooks including the software are used by, and considered the premium product by million and millions of industry professionals in so many fields. And yet, make up about 10 of the global PC market. So, its a niche product. Youre letting a US bias skew your argument. If Apple computers vanished tomorrow it would barely affect anything because PC and Linux run the vast and overwhelming majority of the world. And... beyond their operating system, they dont really make any software other than some apps to run on their OS. Designers Software engineers Project managers Academia Photographers Music And yet every single one of those professions can use PCs or Linux. I used to work in the film industry. Avid, Pro Tools, etc. used to be exclusively Mac. Now, everything runs on PCs because, as it turns out, Macs are extremely overpriced and have no actual value over a Windows PC. So, there was a massive shift in the industry to put things on PCs. Software engineers like linux based things, but running a VM in Windows can accomplish that and allow you to interact with the rest of the professional world without people wanting to strangle the person because Mac cant format a fucking Word document correctly. Academia, no one really uses Mac beyond personal computers. Having spent about a decade in higher education, yeah... only the kids were using Macs. And it doesnt indicate that a lot of people like the software, literally the data shows the vast and overwhelming majority of the world does not prefer Apple products and their software consists of an OS that can only be used on their hardware. The success of Apple is their hardware, it always has been, well... that and marketing to gullible people who think computers and phones are some type of status symbol.

Reddit,2024-08-01,"While I dont think Zuck is outright lying, because AI long driven more effective digital ads, the eyeopener for me this quarter was seeing Google, then Microsoft, then Meta reported very substantial increases in capital expenditures. As a disclaimer, I own NVDA and TSM substantial positions and recently added more on the pullback, and will ride out any swings between now and late August when NVDA reports, which better be a really great report or it will tank, but it probably will be great or everyone will be scrambling to find out where the spend went. Right now, investors are obviously getting skeptical about AI cap ex, which will eventually result in lower mag 7 cap ex, which will be really bad for semis, but thats a second derivative effect and the arms race definitely isnt ending right now. Ill seriously shave my toptier semi positions when these cap ex numbers start dropping in a meaningful way or when LLM traininginference ASICs start eating NVDAs lunch. As far as I know, AVGO just added to a meaningful buyandhold position and TSM are the way for a nonaccredited investor to play the eventual ASICs wave, but NVDA could also come out with their own ASICs. But right now, the megacap CEOs are really excited about AI and they have the money to spend on it. They still have good cash flow and can still spend big if they want to. I think LLMs and other applications of transformers will continue to get better, theyll be faster, smaller models will be better, and context windows will be larger before the LLMs start spitting out hallucinations and functionally break. With the right training techniques, which are still evolving, the transformer that LLMs is based on can remarkably improve on really overdetermined data, which breaks what I used to know about signals analysis and training oldschool neural networks. I think we are going through a routine lowvolume summer pullback with hedge funds piling into the previously lagging R2K, which makes momentum plays swing like crazy. But, hedge funds will be back, and theyll long the same positions they shorted months earlier, and then theyll short them again. Its fine for investors to hold the feet of megacaps to the fire, but that just brings their PE multiples closer to normal for a tech stock. Other position disclaimers Google small LT buyandhold position, they are behind and will probably lose search market share but I wont bet against their data and proprietary tensor core iterations Microsoft small longheld position Meta no position due to longstanding antipathy plus I think they are behind with AI and the metaverse and they have more limited room to grow because 3.5 billion users is a lot, even if many of those are bots. I think they will outperform but wont be in the drivers seat. I still dont see how Zuck is going to monetize their opensource LLM models while Microsoft at least has a plan that may kick in when copilot improves and copilot subscriber numbers improve. I may be in the minority, but I think this will happen eventually, cant say when.

Reddit,2024-08-01,"Youre right that YoY growth is a really bad metric to value a high PE stock, as is comparing this quarter this year, vs the same quarter last year. For me to buy a stock with a high PE, it better have higher revenues and higher earnings every quarter and those numbers better have a strong correlation to each other and to EPS those boxes are checked. I like to look at quarterly revenue and EBDITA I have plugged in the numbers, and I would argue that these numbers are both statistically linear. The revenue numbers do a fit a parabolic fit better than a linear fit, hinting at slowing revenue growth. But, the parabolic fit will always be better than the linear fit, whether or not it has meaning, and quarterly earnings reports make for very sparse data. Im expecting roughly linear but moderating revenue and EPS growth and will unload if there is a big surprise to the downside. With linear EPS growth for the next year out, earnings for the next year would be 23 times higher, making the forward PE, which ignores analyst estimates, very reasonable. Growth will probably moderate because of supply chain constraints and moderation in demand. But, Nvidia doesnt need a PE close between 20 and 30 a year out at these prices because highgrowth market leaders always command a PE premium. But, its very plausible that revenue growth is slowing because TSMs production capacity is a bottleneck and it takes a long time to build new fabs, which TSM is doing. However, Nvidia has historically kept its margins very high when there is strong demand. I think the pertinent historical examples are the last bitcoin bubble preASICs and Cisco around its nosebleed peak with a PE over 200. During the crypt0 bubble Nvidia absolutely crushed it while reddit gamers had daily tantrums about Nvidia charging unfair prices for their GPUs. That lasted until ASICs made it unprofitable to mine with an allpurpose GPU, crypt0 started crashing and Nvidia crashed. Im watching Mag 7 cap ex because Cisco collapsed roughly the month after its biggest customers like Worldcom, ATT, AOL, Qwest, and Sprint started dramatically cutting their cap ex. The now bankrupt Worldcom was an outright criminal fraud that was buying Cisco routers to pretend that they were making money to pump their share prices. So Im worried about demand, Im worried about ASICs, respectively thinking about Cisco and the last crypt0 bubble. The main reason I bought more AVGO because its price is down and because OpenAI is building a new secret chip with Broadcom, which is almost certainly a new ASIC chip that will rely on Broadcom and TSM. Also, broadcom should benefit from its auto and manufacturing chips and cell phone sales will probably pick up if rates go down and its a given that they will go down. But, major risks are that the economy is definitely slowing by almost any metric and the Fed is always late with their rate moves, with their backwardlooking data analysis, and whats bad for the economy is bad for everyone. Also, from now to October is historically a very bad time for semis and Wall Street knows it. Also, we know that if investors revolt on spend, CEOs like Zuck will dramatically cut back on cap ex, like he did after the Metaverse crash. I think if one megacap CEO cuts back on GPU spend, they all will, as I feel they are defensively spending to not get left behind, so the script can flip and growth can turn into misses in a hurry. Finally, I feel that most semi and software stocks are overvalued and catching AI tailwinds for no reason and this will hurt the few stocks with good performance, because hedge algos will work to keep correlated pairs of stocks correlated. The conflict between Iran and Israel could blow up in the near future. Also, the performance of bigger and bigger transformers could hit a wall, but I dont think theres evidence of that yet. I dont think humans are special and that there are intrinsic limits about what humans can do and future AI cant. However, better GPUs will someday be locked down even in the U.S., as a national security issue. But, I have a longterm horizon, and the megacaps that are pumping money into NVDA havent cut back on cap ex yet. Nadela says there is still increasing cloud demand and the probability that he is telling truth is greater than the probability that he is lying.

If revenue hadnt lagged 20222023 the stock wouldnt have declined, so growth would have been more steady and thus less profound this past year certainly obviously, but the valuation wouldnt be less stratospheric at these revenue and margin numbers. You are really grasping at straws. Theres no pattern here to draw any conclusions and nothing youve said indicates anything about what Aug numbers will look like. The ebbs and flows of how it got from 8B to 26B explain the movement of the stock during that time period, but say little of the future as opposed to revenue at companies like TSM, META, and AMD.

I think Xi Xinping wants an invasion of Taiwan to be his legacy, but I hope his peers will talk him out of tanking Chinas economy even more. If Blackwell has persistent watercooling leak issues, that could be a problem for many years. Blackwell yields could be much lower than expected, since joining chips is a new technology. A president could ban GPUs that are more powerful than a threshold out of fear of AI. Policy could be changed to tax cloud providers unless they use green energy, which I would support. Companies could hit the energy bottleneck, so I bought Dominion energy since the largest server farm concetration is in Northern Virginia and NEE to get a little bit of a dividend barbel. The Supreme Court could rule that LLMs are liable for copyright infringement and that all the AI companies owe tons of money to everyone else. At some point, the first globally damaging AI virus will hit and new laws will be passed.

Reddit,2024-08-06,"But with this case, the risk for Alphabet is to be split up. The nightmare scenario for Google is be to forced to into separate search and ad companies. And this ruling will like change their incentives and how they do business. Previously, if you hold search in isolation, its not hard to compete against Google, its impossible to do so and turn a profit. Case in point, Google is paying 15B annually to Apple to remain the default search on iPhones. Its likely not possible to make that much money on a product that is purely used for search. Take the 15B off the table, and Apples incentives change. Googles playbook has always been to build some ecosystem e.g. search, chrome, gmail, drive, photos, maps, much of android, etc, then to leverage that ecosystem to build outstanding ad products, then to leverage that ad revenue to maintain the dominance of their ecosystem. Like Coke needs Pepsi to ensure the dont have a distribution monopoly, moving forward Google is going to need there to be a viable alternative to their ecosytem in order to mitigate the risk of being broken up. Why Apple? From Googles perspective these are the devices that yield the least ad revenue. Since iOS version 14.5 third party cookies have been disabled on Apple devices. Additionally, Apples webkit used to build browsers on iPhone has prevented Googles 3p cookie alternative for advertising privacy sandbox API from being built into the iPhone version of Chrome. Even then, Safari use is currently gaining marketshare. Simply put, if Google has to give up marketshare, this is exactly the segment of the population that gives them the least advertising revenue. From Apples perspective there are 2 industry shifts that might give them an edge. First, because they are not beholden to advertising dollars, theyre not incentivized to build a search product that tracks their users. They would be able to say that their devices allow for privacy, and that their search results are unbiased by ad revenue. Id also suspect that they would lean further into LLM results and integration through Siri. This will be harder for Google because they have always had an unspoken deal with publishers whatever websites, reddit, the new york times, etc. From a publishers perspective, they have been happy to have Google scrape their websites since search will direct traffic to you and then their ad exchange will monetize users that land on your page. But now, privacy features reduce ad revenue per ad and LLM based answers will prevent users from landing on publisher sites in the first place. Because Apple does not make money through advertising and wont face the same pressure from these forces, they may be able to develop the next generation of search. Again, the outcome of this is still very uncertain, but it is much different than MSFT trying to build bing.",Neutral,-1,0.9566780030727386,Reply

You said chat gpt 4 cant pass the Turing test. Which its been proven to do. No matter what your view on the stupidity of the average person, it still passes.

Reddit,2024-09-19,"The hole in the US balance of payments is slowly widening, in the second quarter the current account deficit reached 266.7 bln, over the last 4 quarters it amounted to 0.95 trillion. A large deficit of 1.1 trillion a year in goods is partially offset by the services sector 288 bln. The revenue situation continued to deteriorate 144 bln yy. One of the problems here in recent years has been the fall in US net investment income to 0.09 of GDP, which had been as high as 11.5 of GDP before 2020, but rising interest rates and a relatively strong dollar have brought it to near zero. More and more debt has to be paid, in this sense the dollar is a fundamentally unstable currency that if rates fall too quickly riskadjusted of course will come under pressure due to reduced capital inflows, if rates remain elevated will remain strong in the moment but will continue to face further current account degradation and problems over the long term horizon. Especially given that the commodity deficit is only growing so far the last 4 months have averaged around 100 bln monthly, i.e. approaching 1.2 trillion annualized levels. And this is despite the fact that over the last 15 years the US has shifted from being a net energy importer to a net energy exporter, but everything it has saved on that has been spent on something else. Total external liabilities on the international investment position rose by 7.6 trillion to a record 57.1 trillion last year, while assets only rose by 3.2 trillion to 35.8 trillion, the net international investment position is negative at 21.3 trillion, or 75 of GDP.

Most people really just need a phone that does all the stuff that iPhones have been doing for 10 years and dont need any of the new features or storage or whatever. Without them artificially slowing it down anymore, performance stayed the same because solid state devices dont wear out. Batteries do wear out, but people just started replacing their batteries every 5 years. Its a cheap part. Solid state memory does eventually develop write fatigue where bits cant be overwritten anymore, but, with load leveling which all solid state memory does and typical consumer phone usage, this would take decades to happen.

Reddit,2024-09-09,"Didnt they get sued because they were manufacturing faults that would start popping up in phones after a year in order to force people to get the newest one. iPhones have always been behind technologically since probably 2015. Most of their innovations are things that have happened for other phones already. Now its fine to allow something to be beta tested by a different company and then put it into your own phone. But aside from just having a very good camera, which if you really want a really good camera, you can get a better one on an Android. But then anything said to an iPhone will be scaled down because Apple knows what its doing. Ill give him that. But planned obsolescence is a b but I believe thats why people had to keep replacing their iPhones cuz they would start to mess up and start to overheat battery.

Reddit,2024-09-09,"It was actually several years ago that both desktops and mobiles hit a level of compute power past what most people really need. Look at how apple defaults to 8gb of ram on laptops its not just that they want to keep costs down, most people really are fine with 8gb of ram on a mac air. Why does anyone need the next generation which is more power efficient and not much else? All M chips are great at inference. AI creates a need for more ram but knowing that when I bought my M2 pro with 64gb, its going to be a long time before I need to upgrade. Similarly I have a 13 pro. I used screen protectors and a case and it looks brand new when I switch screen protectors. Its really hard justifying a new phone that I wouldnt actually use differently. And this is the bigger AI question will it actually change anything, and if so, in any sort of pervasive way like replace all your shit? Probably not. The last time I upgraded phones was to get the better camera. To take pictures of my dog. And Im a person who runs LLMs locally. My PC is a beast, but I have never used LLMs for anything but curiosity rabbit holes. Much deeper question about how we treat information, and the hardware is not likely to change that. Remember, we had siri for years. Apple also wants you to hold onto your phone. They provide YEARS of iOS updates, way longer than most android OEMs. That alone tells you they are choosing to make it easier for users to keep their devices longer than their competitors. How often do you see a Samsung 10 vs iphones with the fingerprint button? Iphones are kept way longer on average. Planned obsolescence only works when you have enough of the market dominance, and Id argue that intentional obsolescence decreased a lot in the last 510 years. Now one reason to get an iphone is its amortized cost per year, which can easily get down to 200300 idk, do people keep samsung flagships for 3 years?",Neutral,0,0.9741321802139282,Reply

Apple has certainly increased the pricing of the iPhone over the last several years to compensate for a longer upgrade cycle. If people are upgrading every 34 years now, the average revenue earned by Apple on these phones is probably functionally the same as what it was when people used to upgrade every 2 years.

Reddit,2024-09-09,So the reason that happens is because of Apple refusing to use the RCS protocol for messaging like everybody else or to release iMessage to anybody but themselves. It means that anybody texting between Android and iPhone defaults back to SMS which is an older standard that doesnt support rich texting features such as multimedia or pictures larger than like 100 kilobytes. The good news is that Apple finally caved and announced last year that they will be adopting RCS for iOS 18 meaning the blurred images and videos thing shouldnt be a problem anymore. The bad news is that Apples entire mobile device identity for a period of years was based on blue bubble vs green bubble which made them delay this adoption by an extra 5 years or so.,Negative,-1,0.9833967089653015,Reply

Reddit,2024-09-09,"Yeah, the tech may be missing but i think itll come sooner than later, with the now available ultra thin transparent screens, small cameras performances getting quite good enough for this use case, storage now being small, battery may be hard to stuff in such small glasses they have to balance it so it doesnt look big and so that looks similar to glasses people actually like and not like some helmet from space. I really wish someone tries it again and doesnt fail like the infamous google glasses. I still think Ar glasses will be the next big device to get mass adoption. The watches did well, vr not so well but some nice looking glasses like oakleys with stuffed in cameras, mic and speakers or to be used with earbuds, transparent screen lenses. I think it will be big once someone can make it work. Imagine, having your phone calls, messages, notifications, all different overlays, get real time infos about pretty much anything on the go, you could use them to add some filters, so they now can replace sunglasses but you can customize them. Could even digitally zoom in things and act like binoculars, except they are stabilised, you can boost exposure, get some better vision in low light since you process the image through cameras, of course capture pictures and videos. To some extent, it could probably digitally correct some vision issues and if that worked, it could replace glasses. Then, if they could manage to put some lenses in the back of the tips of the glasses, it could capture 360 content aswell, which to me can become the future of capturing memories that you can live again in 1st person view, using either vr devices or these ar glasses, as the screens can go fullscreen and just behave as vr. And then of course the basic ar stuff, different projections, from simulating screens to all sorts of filters to add to the real world to watch content. And the neat thing with transparent screens is that you can just wear them while theyre off or just just on very low uses.

Reddit,2024-09-09,"I agree. Anyone with more than two monitors or especially large monitors knows that there is a limit to how much input a human can absorb at any moment. I can only see so many things at once, but when I want to know something I want to know it immediately and with the fewest steps possible. AI can help anticipate what I will want to know based on what Ive wanted to know previously. Example Im watching football and a starter goes down. AI might know that I often pull up depth charts in that scenario. AI might know that I want to know if that player is available in my fantasy leagues. A device might be able to display that information for me in a digestible way without opening ESPN.com or looking it up. Example Im on a call for work and someone says does anyone know anyone at ________? AI knows I normally search my contacts. AI displays the contacts for me in a digestible way in real time. Thats the leap, I think. Anticipatory AI with an AR overlay. We all know our phones are really our pocket computers. We have desktops, laptops, and pockets which we stubbornly call phones. A pocket that is always with me and supporting me in real time using AI and providing me with information via wearable tech is a massive leap.

Reddit,2024-08-04,"The combination of technological improvements in 2018, increased accessibility, heightened public awareness, and affordability has driven the recent popularity of AI models. These models were not as easily accessible or capable in the past, which is why their popularity has surged only recently. With this in mind, I do believe there is significant potential for technological advancements and transformations across many aspects of society, which meets the criteria to be considered a revolution. Here are some reasons to back my opinion. Ubiquity AI will likely become increasingly integrated into everyday life, from personal assistants to tools that help with education, work, and healthcare. AI could become as commonplace as smartphones are today, providing support across a wide range of tasks. Automation Many industries are likely to undergo significant changes as AI automates routine tasks. This could increase efficiency but may also lead to shifts in the job market, requiring new skills and adaptation. Innovation AI will drive innovation in fields such as medicine, finance, and engineering by analyzing large datasets, optimizing processes, and even discovering new materials or drugs. Regulation Governments and organizations may need to develop new regulations to manage the impact of AI, ensuring it benefits society while mitigating potential risks. HumanAI Collaboration AI is likely to evolve as a tool that augments human abilities rather than replacing them. Collaborative AI could enhance creativity, problemsolving, and decisionmaking across various domains. Education and Skills Development There will be a growing need for education systems to adapt, teaching new skills that allow people to work effectively with AI and harness its potential. Societal Changes The widespread adoption of AI could lead to societal changes, such as shifts in how we work, communicate, and even understand our own identities in relation to intelligent systems.. In summary, the future of AI holds both exciting possibilities and complex challenges. The ongoing revolution is likely to redefine industries, economies, and nations.",Positive,1,0.996458113193512,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-02,"I daily a ARM Windows laptop for nearly a year now. My desktop runs an AMD CPU. I dont have any modern Intel products as I think they are shit. I am an Intel investor. Some ARM processors might be better than some x86 processors, but its a misunderstanding that you cant achieve the efficiency of ARM processors with x86. Modern CPUs all run microcode, so the architecture is pretty much irrelevant, the performance and efficiency depends on the design of the chip and the manufacturing process. Apple Silicon is great because they allow very big dies and the most modern manufacturing techniques, which results in expensive and very good chips. Every chip manufacturer has its own go at those decisions. AI is overhyped. The PC architecture that includes the use of x86 processord will NOT die. Take a look at the number of attempts that have been made, including from intel! Im writing those lines from an ARM device, that is for me a lot more attractive than any PC notebook can be. But it doesnt replace the consistancy the PC platform has offered, and which is oftentimes critical for the applications PCs are used in. Be realistic. Intel splitted up in 2 parts now chip design and manufacturing. Both are shit at the moment. All 12th, 13th and 14th gen products are inefficient as hell and pretty much defective. Meteor Lake is most obviously a stopgap. But they heard the call and the next design manufactured by TSMC looks very promising. Manufacturing will take a little bit longer to recover, but the investments have been made, they do have all the best stuff coming up again. Those were my objective arguments, now to the stuff I dont understand and probably will never Investors Intel itself has big challenges at the moment. Their recent chips are essentially dying. They are trying to lie themselves out of the issues, but a complete recall of not only desktop chips, but at least the more powerful notebook chips is very possible.

This ARM transition might not offer that, which will most definitely make it not as quick as it was with Apple computers and will most definitely delay it a couple of years. Im an engineer btw, I never worked for a single company that doesnt use some legacy software that only works on Windows machines, and that as an engineer you can even choose to have an Apple computer since most software wont even work there.

Games also whilst cheaper on PC arent free so the money saved from buying a console can be put towards games which can be heavily subsidised by game passes.

It doesnt make sense to give different Windows computers to people that are only using office suite teams, and even then a lot of companies already give Macs to these people as Macs are a lot more user friendly and have less problems for IT to deal with overall.
