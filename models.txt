Here’s an updated list where **Linear Regression** and **Simple Transformer** are replaced with stronger and more competitive alternatives for a robust comparison framework:

---

### **Updated Comparison List**

#### **Baseline Models**
- **Random Walk**: Assumes no structure in price movements; a standard baseline in finance.
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**:
  - A widely used statistical model for time-series forecasting.
  - Provides a meaningful comparison for stock price prediction.

---

#### **Advanced Traditional Models**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**:
  - Strong baseline for tabular data and feature-based prediction tasks.

#### **Deep Learning Models**
| **Model**                 | **Why Include It?**                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** | Captures temporal dependencies, ideal for sequential data.          |
| **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** | Lightweight and computationally efficient alternative to LSTM.     |

#### **Graph-Based Models**
| **Model**                          | **Why Include It?**                                               |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** | Benchmark graph model; compares with GAT.                         |
| **GraphSAGE**                      | Tests AMSPF’s improvements over dynamic neighbor-sampling methods.|

---

#### **Ablation Study**
- **Without USP 1 (Volatility Sensitivity)**:
  - Tests the importance of adaptive weighting during volatile periods.
- **Without USP 2 (Volume-Weighted Sentiment)**:
  - Highlights the impact of volume-weighted sentiment integration.
- **Without USP 3 (Event-Triggered Attention)**:
  - Demonstrates the value of event-sensitive adjustments.
- **Without USP 4 (High-Return Recommendations)**:
  - Evaluates the role of stock selection metrics like Sharpe Ratio.

#### **Ensemble and Hybrid Models**
| **Model**                       | **Why Include It?**                                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Voting Ensemble**             | Combines predictions from GAT, transformers, and Random Forest.   |
| **Hybrid Attention-LSTM**       | Integrates sequential learning with attention mechanisms.          |
