Reddit,2024-08-22,"At lower prices it was an intriguing bet for some investment firms because of the riskreward proposition. The technology was known to be superior to any other at the moment, giving them a strong lead on getting there faster than potential competitors. The biggest risk was the possibility that they would run out of money or not acquire capital fast enough to maintain their lead. The earnings call revealed that ASTS already has the funds to advance their operation through to 2026, that they expect their first five commercial satellites to put them at breakeven, and that the next 17 satellites are expected to be ready to launch in the next 57 months. That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. Without a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years. Why do you think it ran up? It still hasnt lost the daily uptrend and it has retained tremendous growth after doubling in value.",Positive,1,0.9482133388519287,Reply

Reddit,2024-08-22,"Going to redirect to ChatGPT because it will answer the question in far more detail than I ever could The behavior youre describing aligns with what some people refer to as swing trading, which involves holding a stock for a short period days to weeks to capitalize on expected price movements. Its different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day. Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be Day Traders Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations. Swing Traders Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from shortterm market movements. LongTerm Investors Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the companys growth or dividends rather than shortterm price changes. Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make shortterm profits. If you proceed, keep in mind the following Transaction Costs Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable. Tax Implications In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to shortterm capital gains tax, which is typically higher than longterm capital gains tax. Market Risk Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize. If this approach appeals to you, youre not alonemany people test the waters of the stock market this way.",Neutral,0,0.9998124241828918,Reply

Yahoo,2024-08-22,"Well, WDAY is treading water. At least it&#39;s not collapsing like my other holding SNOW 😕. I&#39;ll be fine if WDAY can hold $220 going into the the weekend.

Yahoo,2024-08-19,"Lots of nervousness as we head into earnings. WDAY needs to pull a maneuver like NOW. Exceed expectations for the quarter by a smidgen (less than 0.5%) and raise guidance by a rounding error amount (less than 0.25%). That still technically qualifies as a &#34;beat &amp; raise&#34; and will position WDAY to ramble on to $250-plus. But if WDAY cuts full-year guidance (even if its by just 1%), say hello to $190/share in the immediate term. Fingers crossed.",Negative,-1,0.536108672618866,Main
